# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Veracode

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Veracode with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Veracode with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Veracode.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Veracode (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Veracode, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Veracode single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Veracode supports **IDP** initiated SSO

* Veracode supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Veracode from the gallery

To configure the integration of Veracode into Azure AD, you need to add Veracode from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Veracode from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Veracode based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Veracode needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Veracode, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Veracode Single Sign-On](#configure-veracode-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Veracode test user](#create-veracode-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Veracode that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Veracode, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Veracode** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

    ![Veracode Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/preintegrated.png)

5. Veracode application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In addition to above, Veracode application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| firstname |User.givenname |
	| lastname |User.surname |
	| email |User.mail |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

### Create Veracode test user

In order to enable Azure AD users to log into Veracode, they must be provisioned into Veracode. In the case of Veracode, provisioning is an automated task. There is no action item for you. Users are automatically created if necessary during the first single sign-on attempt.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any other Veracode user account creation tools or APIs provided by Veracode to provision Azure AD user accounts.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Veracode tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Veracode for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
