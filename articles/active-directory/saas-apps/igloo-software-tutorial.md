# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Igloo Software

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Igloo Software with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Igloo Software with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Igloo Software.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Igloo Software (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Igloo Software, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Igloo Software single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Igloo Software supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Igloo Software supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Igloo Software from the gallery

To configure the integration of Igloo Software into Azure AD, you need to add Igloo Software from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Igloo Software from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

4. In the search box, type **Igloo Software**, select **Igloo Software** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Igloo Software in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Igloo Software based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Igloo Software needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Igloo Software, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Igloo Software Single Sign-On](#configure-igloo-software-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Igloo Software test user](#create-igloo-software-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Igloo Software that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Igloo Software, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Igloo Software** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

### Create Igloo Software test user

There is no action item for you to configure user provisioning to Igloo Software.  

When an assigned user tries to log in to Igloo Software using the access panel, Igloo Software checks whether the user exists.  If there is no user account available yet, it is automatically created by Igloo Software.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Igloo Software tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Igloo Software for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
