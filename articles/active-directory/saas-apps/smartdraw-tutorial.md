# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SmartDraw

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SmartDraw with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating SmartDraw with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to SmartDraw.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SmartDraw (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SmartDraw, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* SmartDraw single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* SmartDraw supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

* SmartDraw supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding SmartDraw from the gallery

To configure the integration of SmartDraw into Azure AD, you need to add SmartDraw from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SmartDraw from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SmartDraw based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SmartDraw needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SmartDraw, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure SmartDraw Single Sign-On](#configure-smartdraw-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create SmartDraw test user](#create-smartdraw-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SmartDraw that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SmartDraw, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **SmartDraw** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

    ![SmartDraw Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/preintegrated.png)

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![SmartDraw Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://cloud.smartdraw.com/sso/saml/login/<domain>`

    > [!NOTE]
	> The Sign-on URL value is not real. You will update the Sign-on URL value with the actual Sign-on URL, which is explained later in the tutorial. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. SmartDraw application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

7. In addition to above, SmartDraw application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table: 

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| Groups | user.groups |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.
