# Tutorial: Configure Clarizen One for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Clarizen One and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and deprovisions users and groups to [Clarizen One](https://www.clarizen.com/) by using the Azure AD provisioning service. For information on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to software as a service (SaaS) applications with Azure AD](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).

## Capabilities supported

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Clarizen One.
> * Remove users in Clarizen One when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Clarizen One.
> * Provision groups and group memberships in Clarizen One.
> * [Single sign-on (SSO)](./clarizen-tutorial.md) to Clarizen One is recommended.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning. Examples are Application administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application owner, or Global administrator.
* A user account in Clarizen One with **Integration User** and **Lite Admin** [permissions](https://success.clarizen.com/hc/articles/360011833079-API-Keys-Support).

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment

1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Clarizen One](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2. Configure Clarizen One to support provisioning with Azure AD

1. Select one of the four following Tenant URLs according to your Clarizen One environment and data center:
      * US Production data center: https://servicesapp2.clarizen.com/scim/v2
      * EU Production data center: https://serviceseu1.clarizen.com/scim/v2
      * US Sandbox data center: https://servicesapp.clarizentb.com/scim/v2
      * EU Sandbox data center: https://serviceseu.clarizentb.com/scim/v2

1. Generate an [API key](https://success.clarizen.com/hc/articles/360011833079-API-Keys-Support). This value will be entered in the **Secret Token** box on the **Provisioning** tab of your Clarizen One application in the Azure portal.

## Step 3. Add Clarizen One from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Clarizen One from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Clarizen One. If you've previously set up Clarizen One for SSO, you can use the same application. When you test out the integration initially, create a separate app. To learn more about how to add an application from the gallery, see [Add an application to your Azure AD tenant](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning

With the Azure AD provisioning service, you can scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application or based on attributes of the user or group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, follow the steps in [Manage user assignment for an app in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, use a scoping filter as described in [Attribute-based application provisioning with scoping filters](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* When you assign users and groups to Clarizen One, you must select a role other than **Default Access**. Users with the default access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add more roles.
* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before you roll out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can maintain control by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute-based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Clarizen One

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users or groups in TestApp based on user or group assignments in Azure AD.

### Configure automatic user provisioning for Clarizen One in Azure AD

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

      ![Screenshot that shows the Enterprise applications pane.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Clarizen One**.

      ![Screenshot that shows the Clarizen One link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

      ![Screenshot that shows the Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

      ![Screenshot that shows the Provisioning tab Automatic option.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Clarizen One **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Clarizen One. If the connection fails, ensure your Clarizen One account has admin permissions and try again.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Secret Token box.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** box, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications. Select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Notification Email box.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Clarizen One**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Clarizen One in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Clarizen One for update operations. If you change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you must ensure that the Clarizen One API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:division|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:division|String|

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Clarizen One**.

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Clarizen One in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Clarizen One for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

      |Attribute|Type|
      |---|---|
      |displayName|String|
      |externalId|String|
      |members|Reference|

1. To configure scoping filters, see the instructions in the  [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Clarizen One, change **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

      ![Screenshot that shows the Provisioning Status toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users or groups that you want to provision to Clarizen One by selecting the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

      ![Screenshot that shows the provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

      ![Screenshot that shows saving the provisioning configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running.

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment

After you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment.

1. Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully.
1. Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion.
1. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. To learn more about quarantine states, see [Application provisioning in quarantine status](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).

## Troubleshooting tips

When you assign a user to the Clarizen One gallery app, select only the **User** role. The following roles are invalid:

* Administrator (admin)
* Email Reporting user
* External user
* Financial user
* Social user
* Superuser
* Time & Expense user
