# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD gives you the following benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to Sectigo Certificate Manager.
* Users can be automatically signed in to Sectigo Certificate Manager with their Azure AD accounts (single sign-on).
* You can manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure portal.

For more information about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Sectigo Certificate Manager subscription with single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment and integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD.

Sectigo Certificate Manager supports the following features:

* **SP-initiated single sign-on**
* **IDP-initiated single sign-on**

## Add Sectigo Certificate Manager in the Azure portal

To integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD, you must add Sectigo Certificate Manager to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the left menu, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory option](common/select-azuread.png)

1. Select **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications pane](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. To add an application, select **New application**.

	![The New application option](common/add-new-app.png)

1. In the search box, enter **Sectigo Certificate Manager**. In the search results, select **Sectigo Certificate Manager**, and then select **Add**.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sectigo Certificate Manager based on a test user named **Britta Simon**. For single sign-on to work, you must establish a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Sectigo Certificate Manager.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sectigo Certificate Manager, you must complete the following building blocks:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** | Enables your users to use this feature. |
| **[Configure Sectigo Certificate Manager single sign-on](#configure-sectigo-certificate-manager-single-sign-on)** | Configures the single sign-on settings in the application. |
| **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** | Tests Azure AD single sign-on for a user named Britta Simon. |
| **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** | Enables Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on. |
| **[Create a Sectigo Certificate Manager test user](#create-a-sectigo-certificate-manager-test-user)** | Creates a counterpart of Britta Simon in Sectigo Certificate Manager that is linked to the Azure AD representation of the user. |
| **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** | Verifies that the configuration works. |

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure Azure AD single sign-on with Sectigo Certificate Manager in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Sectigo Certificate Manager** application integration pane, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on option](common/select-sso.png)

1. In the **Select a single sign-on method** pane, select **SAML** or **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

1. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, select **Edit** (the pencil icon) to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane, to configure *IDP-initiated mode*, complete the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier** box, enter one of these URLs:
	   * https:\//cert-manager.com/shibboleth
	   * https:\//hard.cert-manager.com/shibboleth

    1. In the **Reply URL** box, enter one of these URLs:
        * https:\//cert-manager.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST
		* https:\//hard.cert-manager.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST

	1. Select **Set additional URLs**.

	1. In the **Relay State** box, enter one of these URLs:
	   * https:\//cert-manager.com/customer/SSLSupport/idp
	   * https:\//hard.cert-manager.com/customer/SSLSupport/idp

    ![Sectigo Certificate Manager domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-relay.png)

1.  To configure the application in *SP-initiated mode*, complete the following steps:

	* In the **Sign on URL** box, enter one of these URLs:
	  * https:\//cert-manager.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login
	  * https:\//hard.cert-manager.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login

	  ![Sectigo Certificate Manager domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/both-signonurl.png)

1. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** next to **Certificate (Base64)**. Select a download option based on your requirements. Save the certificate on your computer.

To configure single sign-on on the Sectigo Certificate Manager side, send the downloaded Certificate (Base64) file and the relevant URLs that you copied from the Azure portal to the [Sectigo Certificate Manager support team](https://sectigo.com/support). The Sectigo Certificate Manager support team uses the information you send them to ensure that the SAML single sign-on connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you create a test user named Britta Simon in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **All users**.
