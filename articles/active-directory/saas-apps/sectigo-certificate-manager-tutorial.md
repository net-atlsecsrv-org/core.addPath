# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager (also called SCM) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD gives you the following benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to Sectigo Certificate Manager.
* Users can be automatically signed in to Sectigo Certificate Manager with their Azure AD accounts (single sign-on).
* You can manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure portal.

For more information about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Sectigo Certificate Manager account.

> [!NOTE]
> Sectigo runs multiple instances of Sectigo Certificate Manager. The main instance of Sectigo Certificate Manager is  **https:\//cert-manager.com**, and this URL is used in this tutorial.  If your account is on a different instance, you must adjust the URLs accordingly.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment and integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD.

Sectigo Certificate Manager supports the following features:

* **SP-initiated single sign-on**
* **IDP-initiated single sign-on**

## Add Sectigo Certificate Manager in the Azure portal

To integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD, you must add Sectigo Certificate Manager to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the left menu, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory option](common/select-azuread.png)

1. Select **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications pane](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. To add an application, select **New application**.

	![The New application option](common/add-new-app.png)

1. In the search box, enter **Sectigo Certificate Manager**. In the search results, select **Sectigo Certificate Manager**, and then select **Add**.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sectigo Certificate Manager based on a test user named **Britta Simon**. For single sign-on to work, you must establish a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Sectigo Certificate Manager.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sectigo Certificate Manager, you must complete the following building blocks:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** | Enables your users to use this feature. |
| **[Configure Sectigo Certificate Manager single sign-on](#configure-sectigo-certificate-manager-single-sign-on)** | Configures the single sign-on settings in the application. |
| **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** | Tests Azure AD single sign-on for a user named Britta Simon. |
| **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** | Enables Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on. |
| **[Create a Sectigo Certificate Manager test user](#create-a-sectigo-certificate-manager-test-user)** | Creates a counterpart of Britta Simon in Sectigo Certificate Manager that is linked to the Azure AD representation of the user. |
| **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** | Verifies that the configuration works. |

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure Azure AD single sign-on with Sectigo Certificate Manager in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Sectigo Certificate Manager** application integration pane, select **Single sign-on**.

1. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, select **Edit** (the pencil icon) to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section complete the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** box, for the main Sectigo Certificate Manager instance, enter **https:\//cert-manager.com/shibboleth**.

    1. In the **Reply URL** box, for the main Sectigo Certificate Manager instance, enter **https:\//cert-manager.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST**.
        
    > [!NOTE]
    > Although in general, the **Sign-on URL** is mandatory for *SP-initiated mode*, it isn't needed to log in from Sectigo Certificate Manager.        

1. Optionally, in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, to configure *IDP-initiated mode* and to allow **Test** to work, complete the following steps:

	1. Select **Set additional URLs**.

	1. In the **Relay State** box, enter your Sectigo Certificate Manager customer-specific URL. For the main Sectigo Certificate Manager instance, enter **https:\//cert-manager.com/customer/\<customerURI\>/idp**.

    ![Sectigo Certificate Manager domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-relay.png)

1. In the **User Attributes & Claims** section, complete the following steps:

	1. Delete all **Additional claims**.
	
	1. Select **Add new claim** and add the following four claims:
	
        | Name | Namespace | Source | Source attribute | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | eduPersonPrincipalName | empty | Attribute | user.userprincipalname | Must match the **IdP Person ID** field in Sectigo Certificate Manager for Admins. |
