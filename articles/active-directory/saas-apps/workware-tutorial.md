# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Workware

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Workware with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Workware with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Workware.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Workware with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Workware single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Workware supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Workware from the gallery

To configure the integration of Workware into Azure AD, you need to add Workware from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Workware** in the search box.
1. Select **Workware** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Workware

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Workware using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workware.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Workware, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Workware SSO](#configure-workware-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Workware test user](#create-workware-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Workware that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Workware** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `<WORKWARE_URL>/WW/AuthServices`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `<WORKWARE_URL>/WW/AuthServices/Acs`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Workware Client support team](mailto:support@activeops.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Workware.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Workware**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Workware SSO

To use the SSO feature in Workware, the following setup needs to be completed:

#### Enable SSO permissions for Workware system administrators

* To allow Workware system administrators to set up SSO authentication, the SSO Authentication permission (in the **Administration > System configuration permissions category in the System Settings > Permissions to Role** screen) needs to be enabled for Workware system administrators.

    ![SSO Authentication permission](./media/workware-tutorial/permission.png)

#### Set up SSO Authentication in Workware

    1. In the **Identity Provider SignIn URL** textbox, enter the **Login URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal.
    1. In the **Identity Provider Issuer URL** textbox, enter the **Azure AD Identifier** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal.
    1. In the **Identity Provider Logout URL** textbox, enter the **Logout URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal.
    1. Click on **Enable**.
    1. Upload the downloaded **Certificate** into the **Identity Provider Certificate** from the Azure portal.
    1. Click **Save**


### Create Workware test user

1. Sign into the Workware website as an administrator.

1. Select **Admin > Create / View > User Accounts > Add New**

1. Perform the following steps in the following page.

    ![Test user](./media/workware-tutorial/create-user.png)

    b. Select **Authentication Type** as **SSO**.

    c. Enter the required fields and click on **Save**.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Workware for which you set up the SSO

* You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Workware tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Workware for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure Workware you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
