# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with TrendMiner

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TrendMiner with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate TrendMiner with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to TrendMiner.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TrendMiner with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TrendMiner single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* TrendMiner supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding TrendMiner from the gallery

To configure the integration of TrendMiner into Azure AD, you need to add TrendMiner from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TrendMiner** in the search box.
1. Select **TrendMiner** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for TrendMiner

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with TrendMiner using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in TrendMiner.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with TrendMiner, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TrendMiner SSO](#configure-trendminer-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TrendMiner test user](#create-trendminer-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TrendMiner that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **TrendMiner** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER>.trendminer.cloud/security/saml/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER>.trendminer.cloud/security/saml/SSO`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER>.trendminer.cloud/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [TrendMiner Client support team](mailto:support@trendminer.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up TrendMiner** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to TrendMiner.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **TrendMiner**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure TrendMiner SSO

1. Open a new web browser window and sign into your TrendMiner company site as an administrator.

1. In the left menu, select **SECURITY > Identity Provider**

1. In the **Identity Provider** page, click on **SAML** and then click **Next step**.

    ![select SAML](./media/trendminer-tutorial/saml.png)

1. Click on **Next step** in **SAML Backup** page.

    ![select SAML Backup](./media/trendminer-tutorial/saml-backup.png)

1. Click on **Next step** for **Self-Signed certificates**.

    ![Self-Signed certificates page](./media/trendminer-tutorial/self-signed-certificate.png)

1. You can **Skip** uploading a signing key.

    ![uploading a signing key](./media/trendminer-tutorial/signing-key.png)

1. In the **SAML Configuration** screen in **Entity base URL**, enter domain URL like `https://trendminer.domain.com/`

1. In **Identity provider metadata**, upload the **Azure Metadata file** which you have copied from the Azure portal and then click **Next step**.

    ![SAML Configuration](./media/trendminer-tutorial/saml-configuration.png)

1. In the **SAML User mapping** section, enter usernames that you will use to login and click **Finish**.

    ![SAML User mapping](./media/trendminer-tutorial/user-mapping.png)

### Create TrendMiner test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in TrendMiner. Work with [TrendMiner support team](mailto:support@trendminer.com) to add the users in the TrendMiner platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to TrendMiner Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to TrendMiner Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the TrendMiner for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the TrendMiner tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TrendMiner for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next Steps

Once you configure TrendMiner you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
