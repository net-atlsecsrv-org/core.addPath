# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with the Lenses.io DataOps portal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate the [Lenses.io](https://lenses.io/) DataOps portal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). After you integrate Lenses.io with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to the Lenses.io portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Lenses with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An instance of a Lenses portal. You can choose from a number of [deployment options](https://lenses.io/product/deployment/).
* A Lenses.io [license](https://lenses.io/product/pricing/) that supports single sign-on (SSO).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Lenses.io supports service provider (SP) initiated SSO.

* You can enforce session control after you configure Lenses.io. Session control protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Add Lenses.io from the gallery

To configure the integration of Lenses.io into Azure AD, add Lenses.io to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Go to **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All Applications**.
1. Select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Lenses.io** in the search box.
1. From results panel, select **Lenses.io**,  and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Lenses.io

You'll create a test user called *B.Simon* to configure and test Azure AD SSO with your Lenses.io portal. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Lenses.io.

Complete the following steps:

1. [Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. [Create an Azure AD test user and group](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user-and-group) to test Azure AD SSO with B.Simon.
    1. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD SSO.
1. [Configure Lenses.io SSO](#configure-lensesio-sso) to configure the SSO settings on the application side.
    1. [Create Lenses.io test group permissions](#create-lensesio-test-group-permissions) to control what B.Simon can access in Lenses.io (authorization).
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Lenses.io** application integration page, find the **Manage** section, and then select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot that shows the icon for editing basic SAML configuration.](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter values in the following text-entry boxes:

    a. **Sign on URL**: Enter a URL that has the following pattern: `https://<CUSTOMER_LENSES_BASE_URL>`. An example is `https://lenses.my.company.com`.

    b. **Identifier (Entity ID)**: Enter a URL that has the following pattern: `https://<CUSTOMER_LENSES_BASE_URL>`. An example is `https://lenses.my.company.com`.

    c. **Reply URL**: Enter a URL that has the following pattern: `https://<CUSTOMER_LENSES_BASE_URL>/api/v2/auth/saml/callback?client_name=SAML2Client`. An example is `https://lenses.my.company.com/api/v2/auth/saml/callback?client_name=SAML2Client`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update them with the actual sign-on URL, reply URL, and identifier of the base URL of your Lenses portal instance. See the [Lenses.io SSO documentation](https://docs.lenses.io/install_setup/configuration/security.html#single-sign-on-sso-saml-2-0) for more information.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, go to the **SAML Signing Certificate** section. Find **Federation Metadata XML**, and then select **Download** to download and save the certificate on your computer.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png)

1. In the **Set up Lenses.io** section, use the XML file that you downloaded to configure Lenses against your Azure SSO.

### Create an Azure AD test user and group

In the Azure portal, you'll create a test user called B.Simon. Then you'll create a test group that controls the access B.Simon has in Lenses.

You can find out how Lenses uses group membership mapping for authorization in the [Lenses SSO documentation](https://docs.lenses.io/install_setup/configuration/security.html#id3).

**To create the test user:**

1. On the left pane of the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. At the top of the screen, select **New user**.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** box, enter **B.Simon**.  
   1. In the **User name** box, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, B.Simon@contoso.com.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box. Write down the password that shows in the **Password** box.
   1. Select **Create**.

**To create the group:**

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Groups**.
1. At the top of the screen, select **New group**.
1. In the **Group properties**, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Group type** box, select **Security**.
   1. In the **Group Name** box, enter **LensesUsers**.
   1. Select **Create**.
1. Select the group **LensesUsers** and copy the **Object ID** (for example, f8b5c1ec-45de-4abd-af5c-e874091fb5f7). You'll use this ID in Lenses to map users of the group to the [correct permissions](https://docs.lenses.io/install_setup/configuration/security.html#id3).  

**To assign the group to the test user:**

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Users**.
1. Select the test user **B.Simon**.
1. Select **Groups**.
1. At the top of the screen, select **Add memberships**.
1. Search for and select **LensesUsers**.
1. Click **Select**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Lenses.io.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. On the applications list, select **Lenses.io**.
1. On the app overview page, in the **Manage** section, select **Users and groups**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the "Users and groups" link.](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Add User link.](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select **Users and groups**.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog box, select **B.Simon** from the Users list. Then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog box, choose the appropriate role for the user from the list. Then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select the **Assign** button.

## Configure Lenses.io SSO

To configure SSO on the **Lenses.io** portal, install the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** on your Lenses instance and [configure Lenses to enable SSO](https://docs.lenses.io/install_setup/configuration/security.html#configure-lenses).

### Create Lenses.io test group permissions

1. To create a group in Lenses, use the **Object ID** of the **LensesUsers** group. This is the ID that you copied in the user [creation section](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user-and-group).
1. Assign the desired permissions for B.Simon.

For more information, see [Azure - Lenses group mapping](https://docs.lenses.io/install_setup/configuration/security.html#azure-groups).

## Test SSO

In this section, test your Azure AD SSO configuration by using the Access Panel.

When you select the Lenses.io tile on the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to your Lenses.io portal. For more information, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
