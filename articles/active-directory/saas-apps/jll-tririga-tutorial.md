# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with JLL TRIRIGA

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate JLL TRIRIGA with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate JLL TRIRIGA with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to JLL TRIRIGA.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to JLL TRIRIGA with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* JLL TRIRIGA single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* JLL TRIRIGA supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding JLL TRIRIGA from the gallery

To configure the integration of JLL TRIRIGA into Azure AD, you need to add JLL TRIRIGA from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **JLL TRIRIGA** in the search box.
1. Select **JLL TRIRIGA** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for JLL TRIRIGA

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with JLL TRIRIGA using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in JLL TRIRIGA.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with JLL TRIRIGA, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure JLL TRIRIGA SSO](#configure-jll-tririga-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create JLL TRIRIGA test user](#create-jll-tririga-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in JLL TRIRIGA that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **JLL TRIRIGA** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:
   
    | Identifier |
    |-----------|
    | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.valudconsulting.com:PORT` |
    | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.jll.com` |
    |

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | Reply URL |
    |-----------|
    | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.valudconsulting.com:PORT/samlsps/trisaml` |
    | `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.jll.com/samlsps/trisaml` |
    |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [JLL TRIRIGA Client support team](https://www.us.jll.com/contact-us) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to JLL TRIRIGA.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **JLL TRIRIGA**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure JLL TRIRIGA SSO

To configure single sign-on on **JLL TRIRIGA** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [JLL TRIRIGA support team](https://www.us.jll.com/contact-us). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create JLL TRIRIGA test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in JLL TRIRIGA. Work with [JLL TRIRIGA support team](https://www.us.jll.com/contact-us) to add the users in the JLL TRIRIGA platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the JLL TRIRIGA for which you set up the SSO

* You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the JLL TRIRIGA tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the JLL TRIRIGA for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).


## Next steps

Once you configure JLL TRIRIGA you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
