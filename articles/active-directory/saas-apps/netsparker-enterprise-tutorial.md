# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Netsparker Enterprise

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Netsparker Enterprise with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Netsparker Enterprise with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Netsparker Enterprise.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Netsparker Enterprise with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Netsparker Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Netsparker Enterprise supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Netsparker Enterprise supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.


## Adding Netsparker Enterprise from the gallery

To configure the integration of Netsparker Enterprise into Azure AD, you need to add Netsparker Enterprise from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Netsparker Enterprise** in the search box.
1. Select **Netsparker Enterprise** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Netsparker Enterprise

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Netsparker Enterprise using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Netsparker Enterprise.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Netsparker Enterprise, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Netsparker Enterprise SSO](#configure-netsparker-enterprise-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Netsparker Enterprise test user](#create-netsparker-enterprise-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Netsparker Enterprise that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Netsparker Enterprise** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.netsparkercloud.com/account/assertionconsumerservice/?spId=<SPID>`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://www.netsparkercloud.com/account/ssosignin/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Reply URL value is not real. Update the value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [Netsparker Enterprise Client support team](mailto:support@netsparker.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal. 

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Netsparker Enterprise.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Netsparker Enterprise**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

    a. Copy the **Identifier** value, paste this value into the **Identifier** text box in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

    b. Copy the **SAML 2.0 Service URL** value, paste this value into the **Reply URL** text box in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

    c. Paste the **Identifier** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **IdP Identifier** field.

    e. Paste the **Reply URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal into the **SAML 2.0 Endpoint** field.

    f. Open the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** from the Azure portal into Notepad and paste the content into the **x.509 Certificate** textbox.

    g. Check **Enable Auto Provisioning** and **Require SAML assertions to be encrypted** as required.

    h. Click **Save Changes**.

### Create Netsparker Enterprise test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Netsparker Enterprise. Netsparker Enterprise supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Netsparker Enterprise, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Netsparker Enterprise Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Netsparker Enterprise Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Netsparker Enterprise for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the Netsparker Enterprise tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Netsparker Enterprise for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Netsparker Enterprise you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
