# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with PureCloud by Genesys

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate PureCloud by Genesys with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). After you do that, you can:

* Use Azure AD to control which users can access PureCloud by Genesys.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to PureCloud by Genesys with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have one, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A PureCloud by Genesys single sign-on (SSO)–enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* PureCloud by Genesys supports **SP and IDP**–initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the ID for this application is a fixed-string value, only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding PureCloud by Genesys from the gallery

To configure integration of PureCloud by Genesys into Azure AD, you must add PureCloud by Genesys from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using a work or school account or by using a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Go to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **PureCloud by Genesys** in the search box.
1. Select **PureCloud by Genesys** from the results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for PureCloud by Genesys

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with PureCloud by Genesys using a test user named **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you must establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in PureCloud by Genesys.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with PureCloud by Genesys, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure PureCloud by Genesys SSO](#configure-purecloud-by-genesys-sso)** to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create a PureCloud by Genesys test user](#create-purecloud-by-genesys-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in PureCloud by Genesys that's linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

To enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **PureCloud by Genesys** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single Sign-On method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you want to configure the application in **IDP**-initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** box, enter a URL that corresponds to your region:

	| |
	|--|
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.com/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.de/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.jp/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.ie/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.au/saml` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL that corresponds to your region:

	| |
	|--|
    | `https://login.mypurecloud.com/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.de/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.jp/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.ie/saml` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.com.au/saml`|

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and take the following step if you want to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** box, enter a URL that corresponds to your region:
	
	| |
	|--|
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.com` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.de` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.jp` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.ie` |
	| `https://login.mypurecloud.com.au` |

1. PureCloud by Genesys application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes:

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. Additionally, PureCloud by Genesys application expects a few more attributes to be passed back in the SAML response, as shown in the following table. These attributes are also pre-populated, but you can review them as needed.

	| Name | Source attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| Email | user.userprinicipalname |
	| OrganizationName | `Your organization name` |

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
