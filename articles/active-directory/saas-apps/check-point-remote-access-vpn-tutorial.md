# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Check Point Remote Access VPN

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Check Point Remote Access VPN with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Check Point Remote Access VPN with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Check Point Remote Access VPN.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Check Point Remote Access VPN with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Check Point Remote Access VPN single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Check Point Remote Access VPN supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Check Point Remote Access VPN from the gallery

To configure the integration of Check Point Remote Access VPN into Azure AD, you need to add Check Point Remote Access VPN from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Check Point Remote Access VPN** in the search box.
1. Select **Check Point Remote Access VPN** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Check Point Remote Access VPN

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Check Point Remote Access VPN using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Check Point Remote Access VPN.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Check Point Remote Access VPN, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Check Point Remote Access VPN SSO](#configure-check-point-remote-access-vpn-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.

    1. **[Create Check Point Remote Access VPN test user](#create-check-point-remote-access-vpn-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Check Point Remote Access VPN that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Check Point Remote Access VPN** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<GATEWAY_IP>/saml-vpn/spPortal/ACS/ID/<IDENTIFIER_UID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<GATEWAY_IP>/saml-vpn/spPortal/ACS/Login/<IDENTIFIER_UID>`

	c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<GATEWAY_IP>/saml-vpn/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Check Point Remote Access VPN Client support team](mailto:support@checkpoint.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![screenshot to manual configuration.](./media/check-point-remote-access-vpn-tutorial/manual-configuration.png)

1. Configure the required settings in the management database:

    1.	Close SmartConsole.

    2.	Connect with the GuiDBEdit Tool to the Management Server (see [sk13009](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails&solutionid=sk13009)).

    3.	In the top left pane, go to **Edit > Network Objects**.

    * Make sure to select the option **LDAP users** only for Software Blades that use LDAP.

    * Make sure to select the option **External user profiles** only for Software Blades that do not use LDAP.

1. Install the Access Control Policy on each Security Gateway.

### VPN RA Client Installation and configuration

1. Install the VPN client.

1. Set the Identity Provider browser mode (optional)
By default, the Windows client uses its embedded browser and the macOS client uses Safari to authenticate on the Identity Provider's portal.
For Windows client to change this behavior to use Internet Explorer instead:

    1.	On the client machine, open a plain-text editor as an Administrator.
    2.	Open the trac.defaults file in the text editor.
        * On 32-bit Windows:
``%ProgramFiles%\CheckPoint\Endpoint Connect\trac.defaults``
        * On 64-bit Windows:
``%ProgramFiles(x86)%\CheckPoint\Endpoint Connect\trac.defaults``
    3.	Change the idp_browser_mode attribute value from “embedded” to “IE”:
    4.	Save the file.
    5.	Restart the Check Point Endpoint Security VPN client service.
Open the Windows Command Prompt as an Administrator and run these commands:

        `# net stop TracSrvWrapper `

        `# net start TracSrvWrapper`
 

1. Start authentication with browser running in background:

    1.	On the client machine, open a plain-text editor as an Administrator.
    2.	Open the trac.defaults file in the text editor.
        * On 32-bit Windows: `%ProgramFiles%\CheckPoint\Endpoint Connect\trac.defaults`
        * On 64-bit Windows: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\CheckPoint\Endpoint Connect\trac.defaults`

        * On macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Checkpoint/Endpoint Security/Endpoint Connect/Trac.defaults`

    3.	Change the value of **idp_show_browser_primary_auth_flow** to **false**
    4.	Save the file.
    5.	Restart the Check Point Endpoint Security VPN client service
        * On Windows clients
Open the Windows Command Prompt as an Administrator and run these commands:

            `# net stop TracSrvWrapper`
        
            `# net start TracSrvWrapper`

        * On macOS clients

            `sudo launchctl stop com.checkpoint.epc.service`

            `sudo launchctl start com.checkpoint.epc.service`


### Create Check Point Remote Access VPN test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Check Point Remote Access VPN. Work with [Check Point Remote Access VPN support team](mailto:support@checkpoint.com) to add the users in the Check Point Remote Access VPN platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

1. Open the VPN client and click **Connect to…**.

    ![screenshot for Connect to.](./media/check-point-remote-access-vpn-tutorial/connect.png)

1. Select **Site** from the dropdown and click **Connect**.

    ![screenshot for selecting site.](./media/check-point-remote-access-vpn-tutorial/site.png)

1. In Azure AD login pop up, sign in using Azure AD credentials which you have created in the **Create an Azure AD test user** section.

## Next steps

Once you configure Check Point Remote Access VPN you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
