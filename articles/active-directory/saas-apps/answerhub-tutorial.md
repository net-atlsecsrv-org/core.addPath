# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with AnswerHub

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate AnswerHub with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating AnswerHub with Azure AD provides these benefits:

* You can use Azure AD to control who has access to AnswerHub.
* You can let your users automatically sign in to AnswerHub with their Azure AD accounts (single sign-on).
* You can manage your accounts from a central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [Single sign-on to applications in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with AnswerHub, you need the following:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can begin a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* An AnswerHub subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* AnswerHub supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Add AnswerHub from the gallery

To set up the integration of AnswerHub into Azure AD, you need to add AnswerHub from the gallery to your managed SaaS apps.

**To add AnswerHub from the gallery:**

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

## Set up and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with AnswerHub by using a test user named Britta Simon.
For single sign-on, you need to establish a link between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in AnswerHub.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with AnswerHub, you need to complete these tasks:

1. [Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on) to enable your users to use the feature.
2. [Configure AnswerHub single sign-on](#configure-answerhub-single-sign-on) to set up the single sign-on settings on the application side.
3. [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) named Britta Simon.
4. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. Create an AnswerHub test user that corresponds to and is linked to the Azure AD test user.
6. [Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on) to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on
