# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with RStudio Connect SAML Authentication

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate RStudio Connect SAML Authentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating RStudio Connect SAML Authentication with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to RStudio Connect SAML Authentication.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to RStudio Connect SAML Authentication (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with RStudio Connect SAML Authentication, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* RStudio Connect SAML Authentication. There is a [45 day free evaluation.](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* RStudio Connect SAML Authentication supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

* RStudio Connect SAML Authentication supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding RStudio Connect SAML Authentication from the gallery

To configure the integration of RStudio Connect SAML Authentication into Azure AD, you need to add RStudio Connect SAML Authentication from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **RStudio Connect SAML Authentication** in the search box.
1. Select **RStudio Connect SAML Authentication** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for RStudio Connect SAML Authentication

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with RStudio Connect SAML Authentication using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in RStudio Connect SAML Authentication.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with RStudio Connect SAML Authentication, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure RStudio Connect SAML Authentication SSO](#configure-rstudio-connect-saml-authentication-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    * **[Create RStudio Connect SAML Authentication test user](#create-rstudio-connect-saml-authentication-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in RStudio Connect SAML Authentication that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **RStudio Connect SAML Authentication** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps, replacing `<example.com>` with your RStudio Connect SAML Authentication Server Address and port:

    ![RStudio Connect SAML Authentication Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<example.com>/__login__/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<example.com>/__login__/saml/acs`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![RStudio Connect SAML Authentication metadata upload](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<example.com>/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. They are determined from the RStudio Connect SAML Authentication Server Address (`https://example.com` in the examples above). Contact the [RStudio Connect SAML Authentication support team](mailto:support@rstudio.com) if you have trouble. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. Your RStudio Connect SAML Authentication application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. RStudio Connect SAML Authentication application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to RStudio Connect SAML Authentication.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **RStudio Connect SAML Authentication**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure RStudio Connect SAML Authentication SSO

To configure single sign-on on for **RStudio Connect SAML Authentication**, you need to use the **App Federation Metadata Url** and **Server Address** used above. This is done in the RStudio Connect SAML Authentication configuration file at `/etc/rstudio-connect.rstudio-connect.gcfg`.

This is an example configuration file:

```
[Server]
SenderEmail =

; Important! The user-facing URL of your RStudio Connect SAML Authentication server.
Address = 

[Http]
Listen = :3939

[Authentication]
Provider = saml

[SAML]
Logging = true

; Important! The URL where your IdP hosts the SAML metadata or the path to a local copy of it placed in the RStudio Connect SAML Authentication server.
IdPMetaData = 

IdPAttributeProfile = azure
SSOInitiated = IdPAndSP
```

Store your **Server Address** in the `Server.Address` value, and the **App Federation Metadata Url** in the `SAML.IdPMetaData` value. Note that this sample configuration uses an unencrypted HTTP connection, while Azure AD requires the use of an encrypted HTTPS connection. You can either use a [reverse proxy](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/proxy/) in front of RStudio Connect SAML Authentication or configure RStudio Connect SAML Authentication to [use HTTPS directly](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/appendix/configuration/#HTTPS). 

If you have trouble with configuration, you can read the [RStudio Connect SAML Authentication Admin Guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/authentication/saml/) or email the [RStudio support team](mailto:support@rstudio.com) for help.

### Create RStudio Connect SAML Authentication test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in RStudio Connect SAML Authentication. RStudio Connect SAML Authentication supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in RStudio Connect SAML Authentication, a new one is created when you attempt to access RStudio Connect SAML Authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to RStudio Connect SAML Authentication Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to RStudio Connect SAML Authentication Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the RStudio Connect SAML Authentication for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the RStudio Connect SAML Authentication tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the RStudio Connect SAML Authentication for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

## Next steps

Once you configure RStudio Connect SAML Authentication you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
