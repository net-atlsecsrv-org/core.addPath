# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Jitbit Helpdesk

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Jitbit Helpdesk with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Jitbit Helpdesk with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Jitbit Helpdesk.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Jitbit Helpdesk with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Jitbit Helpdesk single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Jitbit Helpdesk supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Jitbit Helpdesk from the gallery

To configure the integration of Jitbit Helpdesk into Azure AD, you need to add Jitbit Helpdesk from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Jitbit Helpdesk** in the search box.
1. Select **Jitbit Helpdesk** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Jitbit Helpdesk

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Jitbit Helpdesk using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Jitbit Helpdesk.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Jitbit Helpdesk, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Jitbit Helpdesk SSO](#configure-jitbit-helpdesk-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Jitbit Helpdesk test user](#create-jitbit-helpdesk-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Jitbit Helpdesk that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Jitbit Helpdesk** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Jitbit Helpdesk Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Jitbit Helpdesk Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Jitbit Helpdesk tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Jitbit Helpdesk Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Jitbit Helpdesk you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
