# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure into Azure AD, you need to add Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure Single Sign-On](#configure-cloud-management-portal-for-microsoft-azure-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure test user](#create-cloud-management-portal-for-microsoft-azure-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Cloud Management Portal for Microsoft Azure, perform the following steps:
