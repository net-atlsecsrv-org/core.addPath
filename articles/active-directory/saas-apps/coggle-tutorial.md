# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Coggle

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Coggle with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Coggle with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Coggle.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Coggle with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Coggle single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Coggle supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Coggle supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

* Once you configure Coggle you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Coggle from the gallery

To configure the integration of Coggle into Azure AD, you need to add Coggle from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Coggle** in the search box.
1. Select **Coggle** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Coggle

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Coggle using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Coggle.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Coggle, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Coggle SSO](#configure-coggle-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Coggle test user](#create-coggle-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Coggle that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Coggle** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://coggle.it/<TENANT_NAME>/login`

    > [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Coggle Client support team](mailto:hello@Coggle.it) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Coggle application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Coggle application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| firstName | user.givenname |
	| lastName | user.surname |
	| email | user.mail |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Coggle** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Coggle.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Coggle**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Coggle SSO

1. In a different browser window, sign on to your Coggle company site as administrator.

2. Click on **Coggle** account and select **My Settings**.

    ![Coggle Configuration](./media/Coggle-tutorial/configure1.png)

3. Click on following **Logo** and select **Authentication**.

    ![Coggle Configuration](./media/Coggle-tutorial/configure2.png)

4. Click on **Edit SAML Config**.

    ![Coggle Configuration](./media/Coggle-tutorial/configure3.png)

5. On the **SAML Integration** dialog page, perform the following steps:

    ![Coggle Configuration](./media/Coggle-tutorial/configure4.png)

    a. In the **Entrypoint (ID Provider SSO URL)** textbox, paste the **Login URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal.

    b. Open the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** from the Azure portal into Notepad and paste the content into the **Certificate** textbox.

    c. Click on **Save**.

### Create Coggle test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Coggle. Coggle supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Coggle, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Coggle tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Coggle for which you setup SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
