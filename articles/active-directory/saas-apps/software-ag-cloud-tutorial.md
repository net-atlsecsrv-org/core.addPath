# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Software AG Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Software AG Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Software AG Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Software AG Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Software AG Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Software AG Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Software AG Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Software AG Cloud supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Software AG Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Software AG Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Software AG Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Software AG Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Software AG Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Software AG Cloud

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Software AG Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Software AG Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Software AG Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Software AG Cloud SSO](#configure-software-ag-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Software AG Cloud test user](#create-software-ag-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Software AG Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Software AG Cloud** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://*.softwareag.cloud/auth/realms/TENANT-NAME/broker/IDENTITY-PROVIDER-NAME/endpoint`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://*.softwareag.cloud/auth/realms/TENANT-NAME`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Software AG Cloud Client support team](mailto:support@softwareag.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Software AG Cloud** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Software AG Cloud.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Software AG Cloud**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Software AG Cloud SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign into Software AG Cloud website as an administrator.

1.  Click on **Administration**

    ![Configuring Software AG Cloud Administration](./media/software-ag-cloud-tutorial/admin.png)

1. Go to the **Single-sign on > Add identity provider**

    ![Configuring Software AG Cloud identity provider](./media/software-ag-cloud-tutorial/add-identity-provider.png)

1. Perform the following steps in the following page.

    ![Configuring Software AG Cloud follow steps](./media/software-ag-cloud-tutorial/saml-1.png)

    a. In the **Identity provider display name** textbox, give the name like `azure ad`.

    b. In the **Identity provider unique identifier for use in Software AG Cloud redirect URI** textbox, enter a unique name for the Identity Provider. The **Software AG Cloud redirect URI** field will get refreshed and populated with the URI. Copy this URI and use it to configure the **Entity ID** and other information in the Azure portal as per the patterns defined.

    c. Import the **Federation Metadata XML** file in **Identity provider configuration** and click on **Next**.

    d. Go to the **Conﬁguration** page and complete the ﬁelds as necessary.

### Create Software AG Cloud test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Software AG Cloud. Software AG Cloud supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Software AG Cloud, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following option. 

Assuming that the Microsoft Azure is configured as a provider in Software AG Cloud, navigate to `www.softwareag.cloud` and click on Login button and enter the environment name. In the next screen, click on "Log in with <IDP NAME>" link and enter the credentials. Once authenticated, you will be logged in and taken to the Software AG Cloud home page.

## Next steps

Once you configure Software AG Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
