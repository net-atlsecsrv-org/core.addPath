# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Perception United States (Non-UltiPro)

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Perception United States (Non-UltiPro).
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Perception United States (Non-UltiPro), you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) Single Sign-On](#configure-perception-united-states-non-ultipro-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) test user](#create-perception-united-states-non-ultipro-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Perception United States (Non-UltiPro) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
