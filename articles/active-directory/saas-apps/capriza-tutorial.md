# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Capriza Platform

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Capriza Platform with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Capriza Platform with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Capriza Platform.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Capriza Platform (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Capriza Platform, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Capriza Platform single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Capriza Platform supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Capriza Platform supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Capriza Platform from the gallery

**To add Capriza Platform from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Capriza Platform based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Capriza Platform needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Capriza Platform, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Capriza Platform Single Sign-On](#configure-capriza-platform-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Capriza Platform test user](#create-capriza-platform-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Capriza Platform that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Capriza Platform, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Capriza Platform** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.capriza.com/<tenantid>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Capriza Platform Client support team](mailto:support@capriza.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure Ad Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Configure Capriza Platform Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Capriza Platform** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Capriza Platform support team](mailto:support@capriza.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Capriza Platform.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **Capriza Platform**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Capriza Platform test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Capriza. Capriza supports just-in-time provisioning, which is by default enabled. **Please make sure that your domain name is configured with Capriza for user provisioning. After that only the just-in-time user provisioning will work.**

There is no action item for you in this section. A new user will be created during an attempt to access Capriza if it doesn't exist yet.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Capriza Platform tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Capriza Platform for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
