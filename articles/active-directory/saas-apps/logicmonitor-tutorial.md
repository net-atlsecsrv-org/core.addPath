# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with LogicMonitor

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate LogicMonitor with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate LogicMonitor with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to LogicMonitor.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to LogicMonitor with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with LogicMonitor, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* LogicMonitor single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* LogicMonitor supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Add LogicMonitor from the gallery

To configure the integration of LogicMonitor into Azure AD, you need to add LogicMonitor from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **LogicMonitor** in the search box.
1. Select **LogicMonitor** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for LogicMonitor

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with LogicMonitor using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in LogicMonitor.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with LogicMonitor, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure LogicMonitor SSO](#configure-logicmonitor-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create LogicMonitor test user](#create-logicmonitor-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in LogicMonitor that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **LogicMonitor** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![LogicMonitor Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.logicmonitor.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.logicmonitor.com`
    
    c. In the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://companyname.logicmonitor.com/santaba/saml/SSO/` 
  
	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [LogicMonitor Client support team](https://www.logicmonitor.com/contact/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:

   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to LogicMonitor.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **LogicMonitor**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to LogicMonitor Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to LogicMonitor Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the LogicMonitor tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the LogicMonitor for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure LogicMonitor you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
