# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Zoho One

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Zoho One with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Zoho One with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Zoho One.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zoho One (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Zoho One, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Zoho One single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Zoho One supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Zoho One from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zoho One into Azure AD, you need to add Zoho One from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Zoho One from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

4. In the search box, type **Zoho One**, select **Zoho One** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Zoho One in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Zoho One based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zoho One needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Zoho One, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Zoho One Single Sign-On](#configure-zoho-one-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Zoho One test user](#create-zoho-one-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Zoho One that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Zoho One, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Zoho One** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![Zoho One Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-relay.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:
    `one.zoho.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://accounts.zoho.com/samlresponse/<saml-identifier>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The preceding **Reply URL** value is not real. You will get the `<saml-identifier>` value from #step4 of **Configure Zoho One Single Sign-On** section , which is explained later in the tutorial.

	c. Click **Set additional URLs**.

	d. In the **Relay State** text box, type a URL:
    `https://one.zoho.com`

5. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, perform the following step:


    ![Zoho One Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/both-signonurl.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://accounts.zoho.com/samlauthrequest/<domain_name>?serviceurl=https://one.zoho.com` 

    > [!NOTE] 
	> The preceding **Sign-on URL** value is not real. You will update the value with the actual Sign-On URL from the **Configure Zoho One Single Sign-On** section, which is explained later in the tutorial. 

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

7. On the **Set up Zoho One** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)
