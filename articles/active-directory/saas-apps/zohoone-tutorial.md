# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Zoho One

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zoho One with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Zoho One with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Zoho One.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zoho One with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Zoho One, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zoho One single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Zoho One supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Zoho One from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zoho One into Azure AD, you need to add Zoho One from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zoho One** in the search box.
1. Select **Zoho One** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Zoho One

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zoho One using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zoho One.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zoho One, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Zoho One SSO](#configure-zoho-one-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Zoho One test user](#create-zoho-one-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Zoho One that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Zoho One** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL:
    `one.zoho.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://accounts.zoho.com/samlresponse/<saml-identifier>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The preceding **Reply URL** value is not real. You will get the `<saml-identifier>` value from #step4 of **Configure Zoho One Single Sign-On** section, which is explained later in the tutorial.

	c. Click **Set additional URLs**.

	d. In the **Relay State** text box, type the URL:
    `https://one.zoho.com`

5. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, perform the following step:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://accounts.zoho.com/samlauthrequest/<domain_name>?serviceurl=https://one.zoho.com` 

    > [!NOTE] 
	> The preceding **Sign-on URL** value is not real. You will update the value with the actual Sign-On URL from the **Configure Zoho One Single Sign-On** section, which is explained later in the tutorial. 

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

7. On the **Set up Zoho One** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Zoho One.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Zoho One**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

### Configure Zoho One SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign in to your Zoho One company site as an administrator.

	>[!Note]
	>After adding the domain follow [these](https://www.zoho.com/one/help/admin-guide/domain-verification.html) steps to verify your domain. Once the domain is verified, use your domain name in **Sign-on URL** in **Basic SAML Configuration** section in Azure portal.

### Create Zoho One test user

To enable Azure AD users to sign in to Zoho One, they must be provisioned into Zoho One. In Zoho One, provisioning is a manual task.

**To provision a user account, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign in to Zoho One as a Security Administrator.

2. On the **Users** tab, Click on **user logo**.

	![Zoho One user](./media/zoho-one-tutorial/user.png)

	![Zoho One add user](./media/zoho-one-tutorial/add-user.png)
	
	a. In **Name** text box, enter the name of user like **Britta simon**.
	
	b. In **Email Address** text box, enter the email of user like brittasimon@contoso.com.

	>[!Note]
	>Select your verified domain from the domain list.

	c. Click **Add**.

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Zoho One Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Zoho One Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Zoho One for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Zoho One tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Zoho One for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Zoho One you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
