# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Symantec Web Security Service (WSS)

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate your Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) account with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account so that WSS can authenticate an end user provisioned in the Azure AD using SAML authentication and enforce user or group level policy rules.

Integrating Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- Manage all of the end users and groups used by your WSS account from your Azure AD portal.

- Allow the end users to authenticate themselves in WSS using their Azure AD credentials.

- Enable the enforcement of user and group level policy rules defined in your WSS account.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Symantec Web Security Service (WSS), you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Symantec Web Security Service (WSS), you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **Configure Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) Single Sign-On** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) test user](#create-symantec-web-security-service-wss-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Symantec Web Security Service (WSS), perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Symantec Web Security Service (WSS)** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog, perform the following steps:

    ![Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:
    `https://saml.threatpulse.net:8443/saml/saml_realm`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL:
    `https://saml.threatpulse.net:8443/saml/saml_realm/bcsamlpost`

	> [!NOTE]
	> Contact [Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) Client support team](https://www.symantec.com/contact-us) f the values for the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** are not working for some reason.. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Symantec Web Security Service (WSS). The corresponding end username can be manually created in the WSS portal or you can wait for the users/groups provisioned in the Azure AD to be synchronized to the WSS portal after a few minutes (~15 minutes). Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on. The public IP address of the end user machine, which will be used to browse websites also need to be provisioned in the Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) portal.

> [!NOTE]

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you'll test the single sign-on functionality now that you've configured your WSS account to use your Azure AD for SAML authentication.

After you have configured your web browser to proxy traffic to WSS, when you open your web browser and try to browse to a site then you'll be redirected to the Azure sign-on page. Enter the credentials of the test end user that has been provisioned in the Azure AD (that is, BrittaSimon) and associated password. Once authenticated, you'll be able to browse to the website that you chose. Should you create a policy rule on the WSS side to block BrittaSimon from browsing to a particular site then you should see the WSS block page when you attempt to browse to that site as user BrittaSimon.
