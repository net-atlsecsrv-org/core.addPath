# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with iQualify LMS

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate iQualify LMS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating iQualify LMS with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to iQualify LMS.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iQualify LMS (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with iQualify LMS, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* iQualify LMS single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* iQualify LMS supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* iQualify LMS supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding iQualify LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of iQualify LMS into Azure AD, you need to add iQualify LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add iQualify LMS from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with iQualify LMS based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in iQualify LMS needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with iQualify LMS, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure iQualify LMS Single Sign-On](#configure-iqualify-lms-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create iQualify LMS test user](#create-iqualify-lms-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in iQualify LMS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with iQualify LMS, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **iQualify LMS** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![iQualify LMS Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-intiated.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
	| |
	|--|--|
	| Production Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.com/`|
	| Test Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.io`|

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

    ![iQualify LMS Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/metadata-upload-additional-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
	| |
	|--|--|
	| Production Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.com/login` |
	| Test Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.io/login` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [iQualify LMS Client support team](https://www.iqualify.com/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.
