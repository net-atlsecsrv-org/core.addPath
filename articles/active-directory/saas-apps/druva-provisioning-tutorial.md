# Tutorial: Configure Druva for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Druva and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Druva.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Azure AD User Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Public Preview. For more information on the general Microsoft Azure terms of use for Preview features, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure AD tenant.
* [A Druva tenant](https://www.druva.com/products/pricing-plans/).
* A user account in Druva with Admin permissions.

## Assigning users to Druva

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Azure AD are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Azure AD need access to Druva. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Druva by following the instructions here:
* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Druva

* It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Druva to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Druva, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Setup Druva for provisioning

Before configuring Druva for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you will need to enable SCIM provisioning on Druva.

1. Sign in to your [Druva Admin Console](https://console.druva.com). Navigate to **Druva > inSync**.

2. Navigate to **Manage** > **Deployments** > **Users**.

3.	Navigate to **Settings**. Click **Generate Token**.

	![Druva Add SCIM](media/druva-provisioning-tutorial/settings.png)

4.	Copy the **Auth token** value. This value will be entered in the **Secret Token** field in the Provisioning tab of your Druva application in the Azure portal.

## Add Druva from the gallery

To configure Druva for automatic user provisioning with Azure AD, you need to add Druva from the Azure AD application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Druva from the Azure AD application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, in the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**, and then select **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button at the top of the pane.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, enter **Druva**, select **Druva** in the results panel, and then click the **Add** button to add the application.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Druva 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Druva based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Druva , following the instructions provided in the [Druva Single sign-on tutorial](druva-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features compliment each other.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Druva in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Druva**.

	![The Druva link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5.	Under the Admin Credentials section, input `https://apis.druva.com/insync/scim` in **Tenant 	URL**. Input the **Auth token** value in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to 		ensure 	Azure AD can connect to Druva. If the connection fails, ensure your Druva account has 	Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications, and select **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Druva**.

	![Druva User Mappings](media/druva-provisioning-tutorial/usermapping.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Druva in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Druva for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Druva User Attributes](media/druva-provisioning-tutorial/userattribute.png)


10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

11. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Druva, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

12. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Druva by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

13. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

	This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Azure AD provisioning service on Druva.

	For more information on how to read the Azure AD provisioning logs, see [Reporting on automatic user account provisioning](../app-provisioning/check-status-user-account-provisioning.md).
	
## Connector limitations

* Druva requires **email** as a mandatory attribute.
