# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Compliance ELF

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Compliance ELF with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Compliance ELF with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Compliance ELF.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Compliance ELF (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Compliance ELF, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Compliance ELF single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Compliance ELF supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Compliance ELF from the gallery

To configure the integration of Compliance ELF into Azure AD, you need to add Compliance ELF from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Compliance ELF from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Compliance ELF based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Compliance ELF needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Compliance ELF, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Compliance ELF Single Sign-On](#configure-compliance-elf-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Compliance ELF test user](#create-compliance-elf-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Compliance ELF that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Compliance ELF, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Compliance ELF** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following step:

    ![Compliance ELF Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/idp-identifier.png)

    In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:
    `https://sso.cordium.com`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    ![image](common/both-preintegrated-signon.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.complianceelf.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Sign on URL value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign on URL. Contact [Compliance ELF Client support team](mailto:support@complianceelf.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/copy-metadataurl.png)

### Configure Compliance ELF Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Compliance ELF** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Compliance ELF support team](mailto:support@complianceelf.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

    ![The "Users and groups" and "All users" links](common/users.png)

    c. Select **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the Password box.

    d. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Compliance ELF.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **Compliance ELF**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **Compliance ELF**.

	![The Compliance ELF link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Compliance ELF test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Compliance ELF. Work withÂ [Compliance ELF support team](mailto:support@complianceelf.com) to add the users in the Compliance ELF platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Compliance ELF tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Compliance ELF for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
