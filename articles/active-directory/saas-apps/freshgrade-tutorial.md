# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with FreshGrade

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate FreshGrade with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating FreshGrade with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to FreshGrade.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to FreshGrade (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with FreshGrade, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* FreshGrade single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* FreshGrade supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding FreshGrade from the gallery

To configure the integration of FreshGrade into Azure AD, you need to add FreshGrade from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add FreshGrade from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with FreshGrade based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in FreshGrade needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with FreshGrade, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure FreshGrade Single Sign-On](#configure-freshgrade-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create FreshGrade test user](#create-freshgrade-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in FreshGrade that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with FreshGrade, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **FreshGrade** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, perform the following steps:

    ![FreshGrade Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

     a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following patterns:

	  | |
	  |--|
	  | `https://<subdomain>.freshgrade.com/login` |
	  | `https://<subdomain>.onboarding.freshgrade.com/login` |

	b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** textbox, type a URL using the following patterns:
	
	  | |
	  |--|
	  | `https://login.onboarding.freshgrade.com:443/saml/metadata/alias/<instancename>` |
	  | `https://login.freshgrade.com:443/saml/metadata/alias/<instancename>` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [FreshGrade Client support team](mailto:support@freshgrade.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/copy-metadataurl.png)

### Configure FreshGrade Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **FreshGrade** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [FreshGrade support team](mailto:support@freshgrade.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

The objective of this section is to create a test user in the Azure portal called Britta Simon.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.

5. In the **Users and groups** dialog select **Britta Simon** in the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

6. If you are expecting any role value in the SAML assertion then in the **Select Role** dialog select the appropriate role for the user from the list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create FreshGrade test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in FreshGrade. Work withÂ [FreshGrade support team](mailto:support@freshgrade.com) to add the users in the FreshGrade platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the FreshGrade tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the FreshGrade for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
