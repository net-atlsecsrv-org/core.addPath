# Tutorial: Integrate Carbonite Endpoint Backup with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Carbonite Endpoint Backup with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Carbonite Endpoint Backup with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Carbonite Endpoint Backup.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Carbonite Endpoint Backup with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Carbonite Endpoint Backup single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Carbonite Endpoint Backup supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Carbonite Endpoint Backup from the gallery

To configure the integration of Carbonite Endpoint Backup into Azure AD, you need to add Carbonite Endpoint Backup from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Carbonite Endpoint Backup** in the search box.
1. Select **Carbonite Endpoint Backup** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Carbonite Endpoint Backup using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Carbonite Endpoint Backup.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Carbonite Endpoint Backup, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Carbonite Endpoint Backup SSO](#configure-carbonite-endpoint-backup-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Carbonite Endpoint Backup test user](#create-carbonite-endpoint-backup-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Carbonite Endpoint Backup that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Carbonite Endpoint Backup** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    ```http
    https://red-us.mysecuredatavault.com
    https://red-apac.mysecuredatavault.com
    https://red-fr.mysecuredatavault.com
    https://red-emea.mysecuredatavault.com
    https://kamino.mysecuredatavault.com
    ```

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    ```http
    https://red-us.mysecuredatavault.com/AssertionConsumerService.aspx
    https://red-apac.mysecuredatavault.com/AssertionConsumerService.aspx
    https://red-fr.mysecuredatavault.com/AssertionConsumerService.aspx
    https://red-emea.mysecuredatavault.com/AssertionConsumerService.aspx
    ```

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    ```http
    https://red-us.mysecuredatavault.com/
    https://red-apac.mysecuredatavault.com/
    https://red-fr.mysecuredatavault.com/
    https://red-emea.mysecuredatavault.com/
    ```

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
