# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Pega Systems

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Pega Systems with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Pega Systems with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Pega Systems.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pega Systems with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Pega Systems single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Pega Systems supports SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO.

## Add Pega Systems from the gallery

To configure the integration of Pega Systems into Azure AD, you need to add Pega Systems from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Pega Systems** in the search box.
1. Select **Pega Systems** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Pega Systems

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Pega Systems using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Pega Systems.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Pega Systems, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Pega Systems SSO](#configure-pega-systems-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Pega Systems test user](#create-pega-systems-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Pega Systems that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Pega Systems** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box, if you want to configure the application in IdP-initiated mode, complete the following steps.

    ![Basic SAML Configuration dialog box](common/idp-intiated.png)

    1. In the **Identifier** box, enter a URL in this pattern:

       `https://<customername>.pegacloud.io:443/prweb/sp/<instanceID>`

    1. In the **Reply URL** box, enter a URL in this pattern:

       `https://<customername>.pegacloud.io:443/prweb/PRRestService/WebSSO/SAML/AssertionConsumerService`

5. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs** and complete the following steps.

    ![Pega Systems Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/both-advanced-urls.png)

	1. In the **Sign on URL** box, enter the sign on URL value.

    1. In the **Relay State** box, enter a URL in this pattern:
       `https://<customername>.pegacloud.io/prweb/sso`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The values provided here are placeholders. You need to use the actual identifier, reply URL, sign on URL, and relay state URL. You can get the identifier and reply URL values from a Pega application, as explained later in this tutorial. To get the relay state value, contact the [Pega Systems support team](https://www.pega.com/contact-us). You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. The Pega Systems application needs the SAML assertions to be in a specific format. To get them in the correct format, you need to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the default attributes. Select the **Edit** icon to openÂ the **User Attributes** dialog box:

	![User Attributes](common/edit-attribute.png)

7. In addition to the attributes shown in the previous screenshot, the Pega Systems application requires a few more attributes to be passed back in the SAML response. In the **User claims** section of the **User Attributes** dialog box, complete the following steps to add these SAML token attributes:

	
   - `uid`
   - `cn`
   - `mail`
   - `accessgroup`  
   - `organization`  
   - `orgdivision`
   - `orgunit`
   - `workgroup`  
   - `Phone`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are specific to your organization. Provide the appropriate values.

	1. Select **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog box:

	![Select Add new claim](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![Manage user claims dialog box](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	1. In the **Name** box, enter the attribute name shown for that row.

	1. Leave the **Namespace** box empty.

	1. For the **Source**, select **Attribute**.

	1. In the **Source attribute** list, select the attribute value shown for that row.

	1. Select **Ok**.

	1. Select **Save**.

8. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Download** link next to **Federation Metadata XML**, per your requirements, and save the certificate on your computer:

	![Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

9. In the **Set up Pega Systems** section, copy the appropriate URLs, based on your requirements.

	![Copy the configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	![Service provider settings](./media/pegasystems-tutorial/sp.png)

	1. Copy the **Entity Identification** value and paste it into the **Identifier** box in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

	1. Copy the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) location** value and paste it into the **Reply URL** box in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

	1. Select **Disable request signing**.

7. Select **Save**.

### Create Pega Systems test user

Next, you need to create a user named Britta Simon in Pega Systems. Work with the [Pega Systems support team](https://www.pega.com/contact-us) to create users.

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Pega Systems Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Pega Systems Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Pega Systems for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Pega Systems tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Pega Systems for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Pega Systems you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
