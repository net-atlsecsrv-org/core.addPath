# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with GetThere

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate GetThere with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate GetThere with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to GetThere.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to GetThere with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* GetThere single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* GetThere supports **IDP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding GetThere from the gallery

To configure the integration of GetThere into Azure AD, you need to add GetThere from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **GetThere** in the search box.
1. Select **GetThere** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for GetThere

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with GetThere using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in GetThere.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with GetThere, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure GetThere SSO](#configure-getthere-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create GetThere test user](#create-getthere-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in GetThere that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **GetThere** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL:

    ```http
    getthere.com
    http://idp.getthere.com
    ```

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type any one of the below URLs:

    ```http
    https://wx1.getthere.net/login/saml/post.act
    https://gtx2-gcte2.getthere.net/login/saml/post.act
    https://gtx2-gcte2.getthere.net/login/saml/ssoaasvalidate.act
    https://wx1.getthere.net/login/saml/ssoaavalidate.act
    ```

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up GetThere** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to GetThere.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **GetThere**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure GetThere SSO

To configure single sign-on on **GetThere** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [GetThere support team](mailto:dataintegration@sabre.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create GetThere test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in GetThere. Work withÂ [GetThere support team](mailto:dataintegration@sabre.com) to add the users in the GetThere platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the GetThere tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the GetThere for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
