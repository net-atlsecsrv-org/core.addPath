# Tutorial: Integrate Dropbox for Business with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Dropbox for Business with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Dropbox for Business with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Dropbox for Business.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Dropbox for Business with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get one-month free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Dropbox for Business single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

* In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Dropbox for Business supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Dropbox for Business supports [Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning](dropboxforbusiness-tutorial.md)

## Adding Dropbox for Business from the gallery

To configure the integration of Dropbox for Business into Azure AD, you need to add Dropbox for Business from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Dropbox for Business** in the search box.
1. Select **Dropbox for Business** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Dropbox for Business using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Dropbox for Business.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Dropbox for Business, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Dropbox for Business SSO](#configure-dropbox-for-business-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Dropbox for Business test user](#create-dropbox-for-business-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Dropbox for Business that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO
