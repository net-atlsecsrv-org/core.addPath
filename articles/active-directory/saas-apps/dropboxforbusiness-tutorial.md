# Tutorial: Integrate Dropbox Business with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Dropbox Business with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Dropbox Business with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Dropbox Business.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Dropbox Business with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Dropbox Business single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

* In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. Dropbox Business supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Dropbox Business supports [Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning](dropboxforbusiness-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Dropbox Business from the gallery

To configure the integration of Dropbox Business into Azure AD, you need to add Dropbox Business from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Dropbox Business** in the search box.
1. Select **Dropbox Business** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Dropbox Business

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Dropbox Business using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Dropbox Business.

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.    
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Dropbox Business SSO](#configure-dropbox-business-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Dropbox Business test user](#create-dropbox-business-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Dropbox Business that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
