# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Cisco Webex Meetings

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Cisco Webex Meetings with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Cisco Webex Meetings with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Cisco Webex Meetings.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex Meetings (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Cisco Webex Meetings, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Cisco Webex Meetings single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cisco Webex Meetings supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Cisco Webex Meetings supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex Meetings based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Cisco Webex Meetings needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex Meetings, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Cisco Webex Meetings Single Sign-On](#configure-cisco-webex-meetings-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Cisco Webex Meetings test user](#create-cisco-webex-meetings-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Cisco Webex Meetings that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Cisco Webex Meetings, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Cisco Webex Meetings** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. In the Azure portal, On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	In the **Sign on URL** textbox, paste the value of **Reply URL** which gets auto-filled by SP metadata file upload.

5. Cisco Webex Meetings application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click on **Edit** icon to add the attributes.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. Delete the default attributes from **User claims** section and Cisco Webex Meetings application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:
    
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
	|   firstname    | user.givenname |
	|   lastname    | user.surname |
	|   email       | user.mail |
	|   uid    | user.mail |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.
