## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO)

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO).

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO), perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Role-Based Single Sign-On in Alibaba Cloud Service](#configure-role-based-single-sign-on-in-alibaba-cloud-service)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Configure Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) SSO](#configure-alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) test user](#create-alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO)** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

	![Assign the Azure AD test user2](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/test02.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>After you assign the user (u2), the created role is automatically attached to the user. If you have created multiple roles, you need to attach the appropriate role to the user as needed. If you want to implement role-based SSO from Azure AD to multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts, repeat the preceding steps.

## Configure Role-Based Single Sign-On in Alibaba Cloud Service

1. Sign in to the Alibaba Cloud [RAM console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm?oauth_callback=https%3A%2F%2Fram.console.aliyun.com%2F%3Fspm%3Da2c63.p38356.879954.8.7d904e167h6Yg9) by using Account1.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **SSO**.

3. On the **Role-based SSO** tab, click **Create IdP**.

4. On the displayed page, enter `AAD` in the IdP Name field, enter a description in 
the **Note** field, click **Upload** to upload the federation metadata file you downloaded before, and click **OK**.

5. After the IdP is successfully created, click **Create RAM Role**.

6. In the **RAM Role Name** field enter `AADrole`, select `AAD` from the **Select IdP** drop-down list and click OK.

	>[!NOTE]
	>You can grant permission to the role as needed. After creating the IdP and the corresponding role, we recommend that you save the ARNs of the IdP and the role for subsequent use. You can obtain the ARNs on the IdP information page and the role information page.

7. Associate the Alibaba Cloud RAM role (AADrole) with the Azure AD user (u2):
To associate the RAM role with the Azure AD user, you must create a role in Azure AD by following these steps:

	a. Sign on to the [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).

	b. Click **modify permissions** to obtain required permissions for creating a role.

	![Graph config1](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph01.png)

	c. Select the following permissions from the list and click **Modify Permissions**, as shown in the following figure.

	![Graph config2](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph02.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>After permissions are granted, log on to the Graph Explorer again.

	d. On the Graph Explorer page, select **GET** from the first drop-down list and **beta** from the second drop-down list. Then enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals` in the field next to the drop-down lists, and click **Run Query**.

	![Graph config3](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph03.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>If you are using multiple directories, you can enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/contoso.com/servicePrincipals` in the field of the query.

	e. In the **Response Preview** section, extract the appRoles property from the 'Service Principal' for subsequent use.

	![Graph config4](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph05.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>You can locate the appRoles property by entering `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/<objectID>` in the field of the query. Note that the `objectID` is the object ID you have copied from the Azure AD **Properties** page.

	f. Go back to the Graph Explorer, change the method from **GET** to **PATCH**, paste the following content into the **Request Body** section, and click **Run Query**:
	```
	{ 
  	"appRoles": [
    	{ 
      	"allowedMemberTypes":[
        	"User"
      	],
      	"description": "msiam_access",
      	"displayName": "msiam_access",
      	"id": "41be2db8-48d9-4277-8e86-f6d22d35****",
      	"isEnabled": true,
      	"origin": "Application",
      	"value": null
    	},
    	{ "allowedMemberTypes": [
        	"User"
    	],
    	"description": "Admin,AzureADProd",
    	"displayName": "Admin,AzureADProd",
    	"id": "68adae10-8b6b-47e6-9142-6476078cdbce",
    	"isEnabled": true,
    	"origin": "ServicePrincipal",
    	"value": "acs:ram::187125022722****:role/aadrole,acs:ram::187125022722****:saml-provider/AAD"
    	}
  	]
	}
	```
	> [!NOTE]
	> The `value` is the ARNs of the IdP and the role you created in the RAM console. Here, you can add multiple roles as needed. Azure AD will send the value of these roles as the claim value in SAML response. However, you can only add new roles after the `msiam_access` part for the patch operation. To smooth the creation process, we recommend that you use an ID generator, such as GUID Generator, to generate IDs in real time.

	g. After the 'Service Principal' is patched with the required role, attach the role with the Azure AD user (u2) by following the steps of **Assign the Azure AD test user** section of the tutorial.

### Configure Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) support team](https://www.aliyun.com/service/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO). Work with [Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) support team](https://www.aliyun.com/service/) to add the users in the Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

After the preceding configurations are completed, test Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) by following these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO)** page, select **Single sign-on**, and click **Test**.
