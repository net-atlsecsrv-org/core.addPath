## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO), you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Role-Based Single Sign-On in Alibaba Cloud Service](#configure-role-based-single-sign-on-in-alibaba-cloud-service)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) Single Sign-On](#configure-alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) test user](#create-alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

### Configure Role-Based Single Sign-On in Alibaba Cloud Service

1. Sign in to the Alibaba Cloud [RAM console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm?oauth_callback=https%3A%2F%2Fram.console.aliyun.com%2F%3Fspm%3Da2c63.p38356.879954.8.7d904e167h6Yg9) by using Account1.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **SSO**.

3. On the **Role-based SSO** tab, click **Create IdP**.

4. On the displayed page, enter `AAD` in the IdP Name field, enter a description in 
the **Note** field, click **Upload** to upload the federation metadata file you downloaded before, and click **OK**.

5. After the IdP is successfully created, click **Create RAM Role**.

6. In the **RAM Role Name** field enter `AADrole`, select `AAD` from the **Select IdP** drop-down list and click OK.

	>[!NOTE]
	>You can grant permission to the role as needed. After creating the IdP and the corresponding role, we recommend that you save the ARNs of the IdP and the role for subsequent use. You can obtain the ARNs on the IdP information page and the role information page.

7. Associate the Alibaba Cloud RAM role (AADrole) with the Azure AD user (u2):
To associate the RAM role with the Azure AD user, you must create a role in Azure AD by following these steps:

	a. Sign on to the [Azure AD Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer?spm=a2c63.p38356.879954.9.7d904e167h6Yg9).

	b. Click **modify permissions** to obtain required permissions for creating a role.

	![Graph config](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph01.png)

	c. Select the following permissions from the list and click **Modify Permissions**, as shown in the following figure.

	![Graph config](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph02.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>After permissions are granted, log on to the Graph Explorer again.

	d. On the Graph Explorer page, select **GET** from the first drop-down list and **beta** from the second drop-down list. Then enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals` in the field next to the drop-down lists, and click **Run Query**.

	![Graph config](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph03.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>If you are using multiple directories, you can enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/contoso.com/servicePrincipals` in the field of the query.

	e. In the **Response Preview** section, extract the appRoles property from the 'Service Principal' for subsequent use.

	![Graph config](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph05.png)

	>[!NOTE]
	>You can locate the appRoles property by entering `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/<objectID>` in the field of the query. Note that the `objectID` is the object ID you have copied from the Azure AD **Properties** page.

	f. Go back to the Graph Explorer, change the method from **GET** to **PATCH**, paste the following content into the **Request Body** section, and click **Run Query**:
	```
	{ 
  	"appRoles": [
    	{ 
      	"allowedMemberTypes":[
        	"User"
      	],
      	"description": "msiam_access",
      	"displayName": "msiam_access",
      	"id": "41be2db8-48d9-4277-8e86-f6d22d35****",
      	"isEnabled": true,
      	"origin": "Application",
      	"value": null
    	},
    	{ "allowedMemberTypes": [
        	"User"
    	],
    	"description": "Admin,AzureADProd",
    	"displayName": "Admin,AzureADProd",
    	"id": "68adae10-8b6b-47e6-9142-6476078cdbce",
    	"isEnabled": true,
    	"origin": "ServicePrincipal",
    	"value": "acs:ram::187125022722****:role/aadrole,acs:ram::187125022722****:saml-provider/AAD"
    	}
  	]
	}
	```
	> [!NOTE]
	> The `value` is the ARNs of the IdP and the role you created in the RAM console. Here, you can add multiple roles as needed. Azure AD will send the value of these roles as the claim value in SAML response. However, you can only add new roles after the `msiam_access` part for the patch operation. To smooth the creation process, we recommend that you use an ID generator, such as GUID Generator, to generate IDs in real time.

	g. After the 'Service Principal' is patched with the required role, attach the role with the Azure AD user (u2) by following the steps of **Assign the Azure AD test user** section of the tutorial.

### Configure Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) support team](https://www.aliyun.com/service/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.
