# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Learningpool Act

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Learningpool Act with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Learningpool Act with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Learningpool Act.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Learningpool Act (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Learningpool Act, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Learningpool Act single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Learningpool Act supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding Learningpool Act from the gallery

To configure the integration of Learningpool Act into Azure AD, you need to add Learningpool Act from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Learningpool Act from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Learningpool Act based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Learningpool Act needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Learningpool Act, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Learningpool Act Single Sign-On](#configure-learningpool-act-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Learningpool Act test user](#create-learningpool-act-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Learningpool Act that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Learningpool Act, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Learningpool Act** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Learningpool Act Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://parliament.preview.Learningpool.com/auth/shibboleth/index.php`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
	
	| |
	|--|
	| `https://<subdomain>.Learningpool.com/shibboleth` |
	| `https://<subdomain>.preview.Learningpool.com/shibboleth` |
	| | |

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Identifier value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier. Contact [Learningpool Act Client support team](https://www.learningpool.com/support) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. Your Learningpool Act application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, edit the claims by using **Edit icon** or add the claims by using **Add new claim** to configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps: 

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------------------- | -------------------- |
	| urn:oid:1.2.840.113556.1.4.221 | user.userprincipalname |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.42 | user.givenname |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 | user.mail |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.4 | user.surname |
	| | |

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog click the **Assign** button.

### Create Learningpool Act test user

To enable Azure AD users to log in to Learningpool Act, they must be provisioned into Learningpool Act.

There is no action item for you to configure user provisioning to Learningpool Act.  
Users need to be created by your [Learningpool Act support team](https://www.Learningpool.com/support).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any other Learningpool Act user account creation tools or APIs provided by Learningpool Act to provision AAD user accounts.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Learningpool Act tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Learningpool Act for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
