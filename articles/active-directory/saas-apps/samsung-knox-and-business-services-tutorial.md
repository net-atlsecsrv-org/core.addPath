# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Samsung Knox and Business Services

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Samsung Knox and Business Services with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Samsung Knox and Business Services with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Samsung Knox and Business Services.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Samsung Knox and Business Services with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Samsung Knox account.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Samsung Knox and Business Services supports **SP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Samsung Knox and Business Services from the gallery

To configure the integration of Samsung Knox and Business Services into Azure AD, you need to add Samsung Knox and Business Services from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Samsung Knox and Business Services

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Samsung Knox and Business Services using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in [SamsungKnox.com](https://samsungknox.com/).

    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Samsung Knox and Business Services SSO](#configure-samsung-knox-and-business-services-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Samsung Knox and Business Services test user](#create-samsung-knox-and-business-services-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Samsung Knox and Business Services that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
