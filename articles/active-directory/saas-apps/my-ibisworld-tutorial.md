# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with My IBISWorld

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate My IBISWorld with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate My IBISWorld with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to My IBISWorld.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to My IBISWorld with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* My IBISWorld single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* My IBISWorld supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* My IBISWorld supports **Just In Time** user provisioning
* Once you configure My IBISWorld you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding My IBISWorld from the gallery

To configure the integration of My IBISWorld into Azure AD, you need to add My IBISWorld from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **My IBISWorld** in the search box.
1. Select **My IBISWorld** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for My IBISWorld

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with My IBISWorld using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in My IBISWorld.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with My IBISWorld, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure My IBISWorld SSO](#configure-my-ibisworld-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create My IBISWorld test user](#create-my-ibisworld-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in My IBISWorld that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **My IBISWorld** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://my.ibisworld.com/account/login`

1. Click **Save**.

1. My IBISWorld application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, My IBISWorld application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| --------------- | --------- |
	| department | user.department |
	| language | user.preferredlanguage |
	| phone | user.telephonenumber |
	| title | user.jobtitle |
    | userid | user.employeeid |
    | country | user.country |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to My IBISWorld.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **My IBISWorld**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure My IBISWorld SSO

To configure single sign-on on **My IBISWorld** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [My IBISWorld support team](mailto:support@ibisworld.freshdesk.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create My IBISWorld test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in My IBISWorld. My IBISWorld supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in My IBISWorld, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the My IBISWorld tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the My IBISWorld for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).
