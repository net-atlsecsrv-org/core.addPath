# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Salesforce

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Salesforce with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Salesforce with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Salesforce.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Salesforce with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Salesforce single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Salesforce supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Salesforce supports [**Automated** user provisioning and deprovisioning](salesforce-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended)

* Salesforce supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

* Salesforce Mobile application can now be configured with Azure AD for enabling SSO. In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.
* Once you configure Salesforce you can enforce Session Control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real-time. Session Control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)

## Adding Salesforce from the gallery

To configure the integration of Salesforce into Azure AD, you need to add Salesforce from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Salesforce** in the search box.
1. Select **Salesforce** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Salesforce

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Salesforce using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Salesforce.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Salesforce, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Salesforce SSO](#configure-salesforce-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Salesforce test user](#create-salesforce-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Salesforce that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Salesforce** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type the value using the following pattern:

    Enterprise account: `https://<subdomain>.my.salesforce.com`

    Developer account: `https://<subdomain>-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com`

    b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the value using the following pattern:

    Enterprise account: `https://<subdomain>.my.salesforce.com`

    Developer account: `https://<subdomain>-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com`

    > [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL and Identifier. Contact [Salesforce Client support team](https://help.salesforce.com/support) to get these values.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
