# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with StatusPage

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate StatusPage with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating StatusPage with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to StatusPage.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to StatusPage (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with StatusPage, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* StatusPage single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* StatusPage supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding StatusPage from the gallery

To configure the integration of StatusPage into Azure AD, you need to add StatusPage from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **StatusPage** in the search box.
1. Select **StatusPage** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for StatusPage

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with StatusPage based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in StatusPage needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with StatusPage, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure StatusPage SSO](#configure-statuspage-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create StatusPage test user](#create-statuspage-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in StatusPage that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **AskYourTeam** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | Identifier |
    |--------------|
    | `https://<subdomain>.statuspagestaging.com/` |
    | `https://<subdomain>.statuspage.io/` |
    |

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

     | Reply URL |
    |--------------|
    | `https://<subdomain>.statuspagestaging.com/sso/saml/consume` |
    | `https://<subdomain>.statuspage.io/sso/saml/consume` |
    |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Contact the StatusPage support team at [SupportTeam@statuspage.io](mailto:SupportTeam@statuspage.io)to request metadata necessary to configure single sign-on. 
    >
    > a. From the metadata, copy the Issuer value, and then paste it into the **Identifier** textbox.
    >
    > b. From the metadata, copy the Reply URL, and then paste it into the **Reply URL** textbox.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the StatusPage for which you set up the SSO

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the StatusPage tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the StatusPage for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

## Next steps

Once you configure StatusPage you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
