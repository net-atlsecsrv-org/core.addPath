# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Zscaler One

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Zscaler One with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Zscaler One with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Zscaler One.
- You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zscaler One (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Zscaler One, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Zscaler One single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

- Zscaler One supports **SP** initiated SSO

- Zscaler One supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Zscaler One from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zscaler One into Azure AD, you need to add Zscaler One from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zscaler One** in the search box.
1. Select **Zscaler One** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Zscaler One

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zscaler One using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zscaler One.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zscaler One, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
   1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Zscaler One SSO](#configure-zscaler-one-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Zscaler One test user](#create-zscaler-one-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Zscaler One that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Zscaler One** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

   In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type the URL used by your users to sign-on to your Zscaler One application.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Zscaler One Client support team](https://www.zscaler.com/company/contact) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your Zscaler One application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

   ![Screenshot shows User Attributes with the Edit icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Zscaler One application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

   | Name     | Source Attribute   |
   | -------- | ------------------ |
   | memberOf | user.assignedroles |

   a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

   b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

   c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

   d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

   e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

   f. Click **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

### Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Zscaler One Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

- Go to Zscaler One Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Zscaler One tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Zscaler One Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Zscaler One you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
