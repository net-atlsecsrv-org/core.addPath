# Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory

Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate limited administrators to manage identity tasks in less-privileged roles. Administrators can be assigned for such purposes as adding or changing users, assigning administrative roles, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, and managing domain names. The default user permissions can be changed only in user settings in Azure AD.

The Global Administrator has access to all administrative features. By default, the person who signs up for an Azure subscription is assigned the Global Administrator role for the directory. Only Global Administrators and Privileged Role Administrators can delegate administrator roles. To reduce the risk to your business we recommend that you assign this role to only a few people in your company.


## Assign or remove administrator roles

To learn how to assign administrative roles to a user in Azure Active Directory, see [View and assign administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](directory-manage-roles-portal.md).

## Available roles

The following administrator roles are available:

* **[Application Administrator](#application-administrator)**: Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. This role also grants the ability to consent to delegated permissions, and application permissions excluding Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph. Users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

  <b>Important</b>: This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to Azure Active Directory, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments in Azure AD. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

* **[Application Developer](#application-developer)**: Users in this role can create application registrations when the "Users can register applications" setting is set to No. This role also grants permission to consent on one's own behalf when the "Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf" setting is set to No. Users assigned to this role are added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

* **[Authentication Administrator](#authentication-administrator)**: Users with this role can set or reset non-password credentials. Authentication Administrators can require users to re-register against existing non-password credential (for example, MFA or FIDO) and revoke **remember MFA on the device**, which prompts for MFA on the next sign-in of users who are non-administrators or assigned the following roles only:
  * Authentication Administrator
  * Directory Readers
  * Guest Inviter
  * Message Center Reader
  * Reports Reader

  The Authentication administrator role is currently in public preview. This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

  <b>Important</b>: Users with this role can change credentials for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Azure Active Directory. Changing the credentials of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:

  * Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Azure AD and elsewhere not granted to Authentication Administrators. Through this path an Authentication Administrator may be able to assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
  * Azure subscription owners, who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
  * Security Group and Office 365 Group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure AD and elsewhere.
  * Administrators in other services outside of Azure AD like Exchange Online, Office Security and Compliance Center, and human resources systems.
  *	Non-administrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.

* **[Azure Information Protection Administrator](#azure-information-protection-administrator)**: Users with this role have all permissions in the Azure Information Protection service. This role allows configuring labels for the Azure Information Protection policy, managing protection templates, and activating protection. This role does not grant any permissions in Identity Protection Center, Privileged Identity Management, Monitor Office 365 Service Health, or Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.

* **[B2C User Flow Administrator](#b2c-user-flow-administrator)**: Users with this role can create and manage B2C User Flows (aka "built-in" policies) in Azure Portal. By creating or editing user flows, these users can change the html/CSS/javascript content of the user experience, change MFA requirements per user flow, change claims in the token and adjust session settings for all policies in the tenant. On the other hand, this role does not include the ability to review user data, or make changes to the attributes that are included in the tenant schema. Changes to Identity Experience Framework (aka Custom) policies is also outside the scope of this role.

* **[B2C User Flow Attribute Administrator](#b2c-user-flow-attribute-administrator)**: Users with this role add or delete custom attributes available to all user flows in the tenant. As such, users with this role can change or add new elements to the end user schema and impact the behavior of all user flows and indirectly result in changes to what data may be asked of end users and ultimately sent as claims to applications. This role cannot edit user flows.

* **[B2C IEF Keyset Administrator](#b2c-ief-keyset-administrator)**: 	User can create and manage policy keys and secrets for token encryption, token signatures, and claim encryption/decryption. By adding new keys to existing key containers, this limited administrator can rollover secrets as needed without impacting existing applications. This user can see the full content of these secrets and their expiration dates even after their creation.
	
  <b>Important:</b> This is a sensitive role. The keyset administrator role should be carefully audited and assigned with care during preproduction and production.

* **[B2C IEF Policy Administrator](#b2c-ief-policy-administrator)**: Users in this role have the ability to create, read, update, and delete all custom policies in Azure AD B2C and therefore have full control over the Identity Experience Framework in the relevant Azure AD B2C tenant. By editing policies, this user can establish direct federation with external identity providers, change the directory schema, change all user-facing content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), change the requirements to complete an authentication, create new users, send user data to external systems including full migrations, and edit all user information including sensitive fields like passwords and phone numbers. Conversely, this role cannot change the encryption keys or edit the secrets used for federation in the tenant.

  <b>Important:</b> The B2 IEF Policy Administrator is a highly sensitive role which should be assigned on a very limited basis for tenants in production. Activities by these users should be closely audited, especially for tenants in production.

* **[Billing Administrator](#billing-administrator)**: Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.

* **[Cloud Application Administrator](#cloud-application-administrator)**: Users in this role have the same permissions as the Application Administrator role, excluding the ability to manage application proxy. This role grants the ability to create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications and application registrations. This role also grants the ability to consent to delegated permissions, and application permissions excluding Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph. Users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

  <b>Important</b>: This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to Azure Active Directory, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments in Azure AD. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Cloud Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

* **[Cloud Device Administrator](#cloud-device-administrator)**: Users in this role can enable, disable, and delete devices in Azure AD and read Windows 10 BitLocker keys (if present) in the Azure portal. The role does not grant permissions to manage any other properties on the device.

* **[Compliance Administrator](#compliance-administrator)**: Users with this role have permissions to manage compliance-related features in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 admin center, Azure, and Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. Users can also manage all features within the Exchange admin center and Teams & Skype for Business admin center and create support tickets for Azure and Microsoft 365.

* **[External Identity Provider Administrator](#external-identity-provider-administrator)**: This administrator manages federation between Azure Active Directory tenants and external identity providers. With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (e.g. authentication path, service id, assigned key containers). This user can enable the tenant to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end user experiences depends on the type of tenant:
  * Azure Active Directory tenants for employees and partners: The addition  of a federation (e.g. with Gmail) will immediately impact all guest invitations not yet redeemed. See [Adding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/google-federation).
  * Azure Active Directory B2C tenants: The addition of a federation (e.g. with Facebook, or with another Azure Active Directory) does not immediately impact end user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (aka built-in policy). See [Configuring a Microsoft account as an identity provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-setup-msa-app) for an example. To change user flows, the limited role of "B2C User Flow Administrator" is required.
