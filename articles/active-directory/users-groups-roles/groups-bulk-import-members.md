# Bulk import group members (preview) in Azure Active Directory

Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal, you can add a large number of members to a group by using a comma-separated values (CSV) file to bulk import group members.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD bulk operations are a public preview feature of Azure AD and are available with any paid Azure AD license plan. For more information about preview use terms, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## To bulk import group members

1. Sign in to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a User administrator account in the organization. Group owners can also bulk import members of groups they own.
1. In Azure AD, select **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. Open the group to which you're adding members and then select **Members**.
1. On the **Members** page, select **Import members**.
1. On the **Bulk import group members (Preview)** page, select **Download** to get the CSV file template with required group member properties.

1. Open the CSV file and add a line for each group member you want to import into the group (required values are either **Member object ID** or **User principal name**). Then save the file.

1. On the **Bulk import group members (Preview)** page, under **Upload your csv file**, browse to the file. When you select the file, validation of the CSV file starts.
1. When the file contents are validated, the bulk import page displays **File uploaded successfully**. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can submit the job.
1. When your file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the Azure bulk operation that imports the group members to the group.
1. When the import operation completes, you'll see a notification that the bulk operation succeeded.

## Check import status

You can see the status of all of your pending bulk requests in the **Bulk operation results (preview)** page.

   ![The Bulk operations results page shows you bulk request status](./media/groups-bulk-import-members/bulk-center.png)

For details about each line item within the bulk operation, select the values under the **# Success**, **# Failure**, or **Total Requests** columns. If failures occurred, the reasons for failure will be listed.

## Bulk import service limits

Each bulk activity to import a list of group members can run for up to one hour. This enables importation of a list of at least 40,000 members.
