# Bulk download a list of groups in Azure Active Directory

## To download a list of groups

1. In Azure AD, select **Groups** > **Download groups**.
1. On the **Groups download** page, select **Start** to receive a CSV file listing your groups.

   ![The download groups command is on the All groups page](./media/groups-bulk-download/bulk-download.png)

## Check download status

You can see the status of all of your pending bulk requests in the **Bulk operation results** page.
