# Assign scoped roles to an administrative unit

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can assign users to an Azure AD role with a scope limited to one or more administrative units (AUs) for more granular administrative control.

For steps to prepare to use PowerShell and Microsoft Graph for administrative unit management, see [Get started](roles-admin-units-manage.md#get-started).

## Roles available

Role  |  Description
----- |  -----------
Authentication Administrator  |  Has access to view, set, and reset authentication method information for any non-admin user in the assigned administrative unit only.
Groups Administrator  |  Can manage all aspects of groups and groups settings like naming and expiration policies in the assigned administrative unit only.
Helpdesk Administrator  |  Can reset passwords for non-administrators and Helpdesk administrators in the assigned administrative unit only.
License Administrator  |  Can assign, remove, and update license assignments within the administrative unit only.
Password Administrator  |  Can reset passwords for non-administrators and Password Administrators within the assigned administrative unit only.
User Administrator  |  Can manage all aspects of users and groups, including resetting passwords for limited admins within the assigned administrative unit only.

## Assign a scoped role

### Azure portal

Go to **Azure AD > Administrative units** in the portal. Select the administrative unit over which you want to assign the role to a user. On the left pane, select Roles and administrators to list all the available roles.

![Select an administrative unit to change role scope](./media/roles-admin-units-assign-roles/select-role-to-scope.png)

Select the role to be assigned and then select **Add assignments**. A panel opens on the right where you can select one or more users to be assigned to the role.

![Select the role to scope and then select Add assignments](./media/roles-admin-units-assign-roles/select-add-assignment.png)

### PowerShell

```powershell
$AdminUser = Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId "Use the user's UPN, who would be an admin on this unit"
$Role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where-Object -Property DisplayName -EQ -Value "User Account Administrator"
$administrativeUnit = Get-AzureADAdministrativeUnit -Filter "displayname eq 'The display name of the unit'"
$RoleMember = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RoleMemberInfo
$RoleMember.ObjectId = $AdminUser.ObjectId
Add-AzureADScopedRoleMembership -ObjectId $administrativeUnit.ObjectId -RoleObjectId $Role.ObjectId -RoleMemberInfo $RoleMember
```

The highlighted section may be changed as required for the specific environment.

### Microsoft Graph

```http
Http request
POST /administrativeUnits/{id}/scopedRoleMembers
    
Request body
{
  "roleId": "roleId-value",
  "roleMemberInfo": {
    "id": "id-value"
  }
}
```

## List the scoped admins on an AU

### Azure portal

All the role assignments done with an administrative unit scope can be viewed in the [Administrative units section of Azure AD](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?microsoft_aad_iam_adminunitprivatepreview=true&microsoft_aad_iam_rbacv2=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AdminUnit). Go to **Azure AD > Administrative units** in the portal. Select the admin unit for the role assignments you want to list. Select **Roles and administrators** and open a role to view the assignments in the admin unit.

### PowerShell

```powershell
$administrativeUnit = Get-AzureADAdministrativeUnit -Filter "displayname eq 'The display name of the unit'"
Get-AzureADScopedRoleMembership -ObjectId $administrativeUnit.ObjectId | fl *
```

The highlighted section may be changed as required for the specific environment.

### Microsoft Graph

```http
Http request
GET /administrativeUnits/{id}/scopedRoleMembers
Request body
{}
```
