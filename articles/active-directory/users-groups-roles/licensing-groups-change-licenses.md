# Change the license for a single user in a licensed group in Azure Active Directory

This article describes the recommended method to move users between product licenses when using group-based licensing. The goal of this approach is to ensure that there's no loss of service or data during the migration: users should switch between products seamlessly. Two variants of the migration process are covered:

- Simple migration between product licenses that don't contain conflicting service plans, such as migrating between Office 365 Enterprise E3 and Office 365 Enterprise E5.

- More complex migration between products that contain some conflicting service plans, such as migrating between Office 365 Enterprise E1 and Office 365 Enterprise E3. For more information about conflicts, see [Conflicting service plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-problem-resolution-azure-portal#conflicting-service-plans) and [Service plans that can't be assigned at the same time](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-product-and-service-plan-reference#service-plans-that-cannot-be-assigned-at-the-same-time).

This article includes sample PowerShell code that can be used to perform the migration and verification steps. The code is especially useful for large-scale operations where it's not feasible to perform the steps manually.

## Before you begin
Before you begin the migration, it's important to verify certain assumptions are true for all of the users to be migrated. If the assumptions aren't true for all of the users, the migration might fail for some. As a result, some of the users might lose access to services or data. The following assumptions should be verified:

- Users have the *source license* that's assigned by using group-based licensing. The licenses for the product to move away from are inherited from a single source group and aren't assigned directly.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If licenses are also assigned directly, they can prevent the application of the *target license*. Learn more about [direct and group license assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced#direct-licenses-coexist-with-group-licenses). You might want to use a [PowerShell script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-ps-examples#check-if-user-license-is-assigned-directly-or-inherited-from-a-group) to check if users have direct licenses.

- You have enough available licenses for the target product. If you don't have enough licenses, some users might not get the *target license*. You can [check the number of available licenses](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/LicensesMenuBlade/Products).

- Users don't have other assigned product licenses that can conflict with the *target license* or prevent removal of the *source license*. For example, a license from an add-on product like Workplace Analytics or Project Online, that has a dependency on other products.

- Understand how groups are managed in your environment. For example, if you manage groups on-premises and sync them into Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) via Azure AD Connect, then you add/remove users by using your on-premises system. It takes time for the changes to sync into Azure AD and get picked up by group-based licensing. If you're using Azure AD dynamic group memberships, you add/remove users by modifying their attributes instead. However, the overall migration process remains the same. The only difference is how you add/remove users for group membership.

## Migrate users between products that don't have conflicting service plans

The migration goal is to use group-based licensing to change user licenses from a *source license* (in this example: Office 365 Enterprise E3) to a *target license* (in this example: Office 365 Enterprise E5). The two products in this scenario don't contain conflicting service plans, so they can be fully assigned at the same time without a conflict. At no point during the migration should users lose access to services or data. The migration is performed in small "batches." You can validate the outcome for each batch and minimize the scope of any problems that might occur during the process. Overall, the process is as follows:

1.	Users are members of a source group and they inherit the *source license* from that group.

2.	Create a target group with the *target license* but without any members.

3.	Add a batch of users to the target group. Group-based licensing picks up the change and assigns the *target license*. The process can take an extended amount of time, depending on the size of the batch and other activities in the tenant.

4.	Verify that the batch of users is fully processed by group-based licensing. Confirm that each user has the *target license* assigned. Check that users didn't end up in an error state, such as conflicts with other products or lack of sufficient licenses. For more information about errors, see [Active Directory licensing group problem resolution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-problem-resolution-azure-portal).

5.	At this point, users have both the *source license* and *target license* assigned.

6.	Remove the same user batch from the source group. Group-based licensing responds to the change and the *source licenses* are removed from the users.

7.	Repeat the process for subsequent batches of users.

### Migrate a single user by using the Azure portal

This is a simple walkthrough for how to migrate a single user.

**STEP 1**: The user has a *source license* that's inherited from the group. There are no direct assignments for the license:

![User with a source license inherited from the group](./media/licensing-groups-change-licenses/UserWithSourceLicenseInherited.png)

**STEP 2**: The user is added to the target group and group-based licensing processes the change. The user now has both the *source license* and *target license* that are inherited from groups:

![User with both a source and target license inherited from groups](./media/licensing-groups-change-licenses/UserWithBothSourceAndTargetLicense.png)

**STEP 3**: The user is removed from the source group and group-based licensing processes the change. The user now has only the *target license*:

![User with a target license inherited from the group](./media/licensing-groups-change-licenses/UserWithTargetLicenseAssigned.png)

### Automate migration by using Azure PowerShell
The following snippet shows how to automate the migration process for a large-scale operation.

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code uses PowerShell functions that are included in the [last section](#powershell-automation-of-migration-and-verification-steps) of this article.

```powershell

## Migrate users between products that have conflicting service plans
The migration goal is to use group-based licensing to change user licenses from a *source license* (in this example: Office 365 Enterprise E1) to a *target license* (in this example: Office 365 Enterprise E3). The two products in this scenario contain conflicting service plans, so you have to work around the conflict to seamlessly migrate the users. For more information about these conflicts, see [Active Directory licensing group problem resolution: Conflicting service plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-problem-resolution-azure-portal#conflicting-service-plans). At no point during the migration should users lose access to services or data. The migration is performed in small "batches." You can validate the outcome for each batch and minimize the scope of any problems that might occur during the process. Overall, the process is as follows:

1.	Users are members of a source group and they inherit the *source license* from that group.

2.	Create a target group with the *target license* but without any members.

3.	Add a batch of users to the target group. Group-based licensing picks up the change and tries to assign the *target license*. The assignment fails due to conflicts between services in the two products. Group-based licensing records the failure as an error on each user. The process can take an extended amount of time, depending on the size of the batch and other activities in the tenant.

4.	Verify that the batch of users is fully processed by group-based licensing. Confirm that each user has the conflict error recorded. Check that some users didn't end up in an unexpected error state. For more information about errors, see [Active Directory licensing group problem resolution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-problem-resolution-azure-portal).

5.	At this point, users still have the *source license* and a conflict error for the *target license*. The users don't yet have the *target license* assigned.

6.	Remove the same user batch from the source group. Group-based licensing responds to the change and the *source license* is removed from each user. The conflict error is removed at the same time (when no other product license contributes to the error) and the *target license* is assigned. This process ensures that there's no loss of services or data during the transition.

7.	Repeat the process for subsequent batches of users.

**STEP 2**: The user is added to the target group and group-based licensing processes the change. Because the user still has the *source license*, the *target license* is in an error state due to the conflict:

![User with a source license inherited from the group and target license in an error state](./media/licensing-groups-change-licenses/UserWithSourceLicenseAndTargetLicenseInConflict.png)

**STEP 3**: The user is removed from the source group and group-based licensing processes the change. The *target license* is applied to the user:
