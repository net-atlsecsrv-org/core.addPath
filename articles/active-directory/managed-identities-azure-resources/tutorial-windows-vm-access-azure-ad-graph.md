# Tutorial: Use a Windows VM system-assigned managed identity to access Azure AD Graph API

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](~/includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to use a system-assigned managed identity for a Windows virtual machine (VM) to access the Azure AD Graph API to retrieve its group memberships. Managed identities for Azure resources are automatically managed by Azure and enable you to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication without needing to insert credentials into your code.  For this tutorial you will query your VM identity's membership in Azure AD groups. Group information is often used in authorization decisions, for example. Under the covers, your VM's managed identity is represented by a **Service Principal** in Azure AD. Before you do the group query, add the service principal representing the VM's identity to a group in Azure AD. You can do this using Azure PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-tut-prereqs](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-tut-prereqs.md)]

- To grant a VM identity access to Azure AD Graph, your account needs to be assigned the **Global Admin** role in Azure AD.
- Install the latest [Azure AD PowerShell](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) if you haven't already. 

## Connect to Azure AD

You need to connect to Azure AD to assign the VM to a group as well as grant the VM permission to retrieve its group memberships. You can use Connect-AzureAD cmdlet directly or with TenantId paramter in case you have multiple tenants.

```powershell
Connect-AzureAD
```
OR
```powershell
Connect-AzureAD -TenantId "Object Id of the tenant"
```

## Add your VM identity to a group in Azure AD

When you enabled system-assigned managed identity on the Windows VM, it created a service principal in Azure AD.  Now you need to add the VM to a group.  The following example creates a new group in Azure AD and adds your VM's service principal to that group:

```powershell
New-AzureADGroup -DisplayName "myGroup" -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "NotSet"
$AzureADGroup = Get-AzureADGroup -Filter "displayName eq 'myGroup'"
$ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'myVM'"
Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $AzureADGroup.ObjectID -RefObjectId $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId
```
## Grant your VM access to the Azure AD Graph API

Using managed identities for Azure resources, your code can get access tokens to authenticate to resources that support Azure AD authentication. The Microsoft Azure AD Graph API supports Azure AD authentication. In this step, you will grant your VM identity's service principal access to the Azure AD Graph so that it can query group memberships. Service principals are granted access to the Microsoft or Azure AD Graph through **Application Permissions**. The type of application permission you need to grant depends on the entity you want to access in the MS or Azure AD Graph.

For this tutorial, you will grant your VM identity the ability to query group memberships using the ```Directory.Read.All``` application permission. To grant this permission, you will need a user account that is assigned the Global Admin role in Azure AD. Normally you would grant an application permission by visiting your application's registration in the Azure portal and adding the permission there. However, managed identities for Azure resources does not register application objects in Azure AD, it only registers service principals. To register the application permission you will use the Azure AD PowerShell command line tool. 

Azure AD Graph:
- Service Principal appId (used when granting app permission): 00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000
- Resource ID (used when requesting access token from managed identities for Azure resources): https://graph.windows.net
- Permission scope reference: [Azure AD Graph Permissions Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes)

### Grant application permissions using Azure AD PowerShell

You will need Azure AD PowerShell to use this option. If you don't have it installed, [download the latest version](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) before continuing.

1. Open a PowerShell window and connect to Azure AD:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureAD
   ```
   To connect to a specific Azure Active Directory, use the _TenantId_ parameter, as follows:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureAD -TenantId "Object Id of the tenant"
   ```

   
2. Run the following PowerShell commands to assign the ``Directory.Read.All`` application permission to the service principal that represents your VM's identity.

   ```powershell
   $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'myVM'"
   $GraphAppId = "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
   $GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
   $PermissionName = "Directory.Read.All"
   $AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}
   New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId -PrincipalId $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId -ResourceId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId -Id $AppRole.Id
   ``` 

   Output from the final command should look like this, returning the ID of the assignment:
        
   `ObjectId`:`gzR5KyLAiUOTiqFhNeWZWBtK7ZKqNJxAiWYXYVHlgMs`

   `ResourceDisplayName`:`Windows Azure Active Directory`

   `PrincipalDisplayName`:`myVM` 

   If the call to `New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment` fails with the error `bad request, one or more properties are invalid` the app permission may already be assigned to the VM identity's service principal. You can use the following PowerShell commands to check if the application permission already exists between your VM's identity and Azure AD Graph:

   ```powershell
   $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '<VM-NAME>'"
   $GraphAppId = "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
   $GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
   $PermissionName = "Directory.Read.All"
   $AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}
   Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $AppRole.Id -and $_.PrincipalId -eq $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId}
   ```

   You can use the following PowerShell commands to list all app permissions that have been granted to Azure AD Graph:

   ```powershell
   $GraphAppId = "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
   $GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
   Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId
   ``` 

   You can use the following PowerShell commands to remove app permissions that have been granted to your VM's identity for Azure AD Graph:

   ```powershell
   $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '<VM-NAME>'"
   $GraphAppId = "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
   $GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
   $PermissionName = "Directory.Read.All"
   $AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}   
   $ServiceAppRoleAssignment = Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $AppRole.Id -and $_.PrincipalId -eq $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId}
   Remove-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment -AppRoleAssignmentId $ServiceAppRoleAssignment.ObjectId -ObjectId $ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId
   ```
 
## Get an access token using the VM's identity to call Azure AD Graph 

To use the VM's system assigned managed identity for authentication to Azure AD Graph, you need to make requests from the VM.

1. In the portal, navigate to **Virtual Machines**, go to your Windows VM, and in the **Overview** blade, click **Connect**.  
2. Enter in your **Username** and **Password** you used when you created the Windows VM.
3. Now that you have created a Remote Desktop Connection with the virtual machine, open PowerShell in the remote session.  
4. Using PowerShellâ€™s Invoke-WebRequest, make a request to the local managed identities for Azure resources endpoint to get an access token for Azure AD Graph.

   ```powershell
   $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://graph.windows.net' -Method GET -Headers @{Metadata="true"}
   ```

   Convert the response from a JSON object to a PowerShell object.

   ```powershell
   $content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```

   Extract the access token from the response.

   ```powershell
   $AccessToken = $content.access_token
   ```

5. Using the Object ID of your VM identity's service principal (you can retrieve this value from the variable declared in previous steps: ``$ManagedIdentitiesServicePrincipal.ObjectId``), you can query the Azure AD Graph API to retrieve its group memberships. Replace `<OBJECT ID>` with the Object ID from the previous step and <`ACCESS-TOKEN>` with the previously obtained access token:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest 'https://graph.windows.net/<Tenant ID>/servicePrincipals/<VM Object ID>/getMemberGroups?api-version=1.6' -Method POST -Body '{"securityEnabledOnly":"false"}' -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $AccessToken"} -ContentType "application/json"
   ```
   
   The response contains the `Object ID` of the group that you added your VM's service principal to in earlier steps.

   Response:

   ```powershell   
   Content : {"odata.metadata":"https://graph.windows.net/<Tenant ID>/$metadata#Collection(Edm.String)","value":["<ObjectID of VM's group membership>"]}
   ```
