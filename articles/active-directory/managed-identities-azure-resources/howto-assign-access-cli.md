# Assign a managed identity access to a resource using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Once you've configured an Azure resource with a managed identity, you can give the managed identity access to another resource, just like any security principal. This example shows you how to give an Azure virtual machine or virtual machine scale set's managed identity access to an Azure storage account using Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#how-does-the-managed-identities-for-azure-resources-work)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- To run the CLI script examples, you have three options:
    - Use [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md) from the Azure portal (see next section).
    - Use the embedded Azure Cloud Shell via the "Try It" button, located in the top right corner of each code block.
    - [Install the latest version of Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if you prefer to use a local CLI console.

## Use RBAC to assign a managed identity access to another resource

After you've enabled managed identity on an Azure resource, such as an [Azure virtual machine](qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md) or [Azure virtual machine scale set](qs-configure-cli-windows-vmss.md): 

1. If you're using the Azure CLI in a local console, first sign in to Azure using [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login). Use an account that is associated with the Azure subscription under which you would like to deploy the VM or virtual machine scale set:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   ```

2. In this example, we are giving an Azure virtual machine access to a storage account. First we use [az resource list](/cli/azure/resource/#az-resource-list) to get the service principal for the virtual machine named myVM:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   spID=$(az resource list -n myVM --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv)
   ```
   For an Azure virtual machine scale set, the command is the same except here, you get the service principal for the virtual machine scale set named "DevTestVMSS":
   
   ```azurecli-interactive
   spID=$(az resource list -n DevTestVMSS --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv)
   ```

3. Once you have the service principal ID, use [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) to give the virtual machine or virtual machine scale set "Reader" access to a storage account called "myStorageAcct":

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az role assignment create --assignee $spID --role 'Reader' --scope /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myStorageAcct
   ```

- To enable managed identity on an Azure virtual machine, see [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on an Azure VM using Azure CLI](qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md).
- To enable managed identity on an Azure virtual machine scale set, see [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a virtual machine scale set using Azure CLI](qs-configure-cli-windows-vmss.md).
