# Tutorial: Use a Windows VM system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Cosmos DB

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to use a system-assigned managed identity for a Windows virtual machine (VM) to access Cosmos DB. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Cosmos DB account
> * Grant a Windows VM system-assigned managed identity access to the Cosmos DB account access keys
> * Get an access token using the Windows VM system-assigned managed identity to call Azure Resource Manager
> * Get access keys from Azure Resource Manager to make Cosmos DB calls

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-tut-prereqs](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-tut-prereqs.md)]

- Install the latest version of [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)

## Create a Cosmos DB account 

If you don't already have one, create a Cosmos DB account. You can skip this step and use an existing Cosmos DB account. 

1. Click the **+/Create new service** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.
2. Click **Databases**, then **Azure Cosmos DB**, and a new "New account" panel  displays.
3. Enter an **ID** for the Cosmos DB account, which you use later.  
4. **API** should be set to "SQL." The approach described in this tutorial can be used with the other available API types, but the steps in this tutorial are for the SQL API.
5. Ensure the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** match the ones you specified when you created your VM in the previous step.  Select a **Location** where Cosmos DB is available.
6. Click **Create**.

## Create a collection in the Cosmos DB account

Next, add a data collection in the Cosmos DB account that you can query in later steps.

1. Navigate to your newly created Cosmos DB account.
2. On the **Overview** tab click the **+/Add Collection** button, and an "Add Collection" panel slides out.
3. Give the collection a database ID, collection ID, select a storage capacity, enter a partition key, enter a throughput value, then click **OK**.  For this tutorial, it is sufficient to use "Test" as the database ID and collection ID, select a fixed storage capacity and lowest throughput (400 RU/s).  

## Grant Windows VM system-assigned managed identity access to the Cosmos DB account access keys

Cosmos DB does not natively support Azure AD authentication. However, you can use a system-assigned managed identity to retrieve a Cosmos DB access key from the Resource Manager, and use the key to access Cosmos DB. In this step, you grant your Windows VM system-assigned managed identity access to the keys to the Cosmos DB account.

To grant the Windows VM system-assigned managed identity access to the Cosmos DB account in Azure Resource Manager using PowerShell, update the values for `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>`, `<RESOURCE GROUP>`, and `<COSMOS DB ACCOUNT NAME>` for your environment. Cosmos DB supports two levels of granularity when using access keys:  read/write access to the account, and read-only access to the account.  Assign the `DocumentDB Account Contributor` role if you want to get read/write keys for the account, or assign the `Cosmos DB Account Reader Role` role if you want to get read-only keys for the account.  For this tutorial, assign the `Cosmos DB Account Reader Role`:

```azurepowershell
$spID = (Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myRG -Name myVM).identity.principalid
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $spID -RoleDefinitionName "Cosmos DB Account Reader Role" -Scope "/subscriptions/<mySubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/<COSMOS DB ACCOUNT NAME>"
```
## Get an access token using the Windows VM system-assigned managed identity to call Azure Resource Manager

For the remainder of the tutorial, we will work from the VM we created earlier. 

You will need to install the latest version of [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on your Windows VM.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Virtual Machines**, go to your Windows virtual machine, then from the **Overview** page click **Connect** at the top. 
2. Enter in your **Username** and **Password** for which you added when you created the Windows VM. 
3. Now that you have created a **Remote Desktop Connection** with the virtual machine, open PowerShell in the remote session.
4. Using Powershellâ€™s Invoke-WebRequest, make a request to the local managed identities for Azure resources endpoint to get an access token for Azure Resource Manager.

   ```powershell
   $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F' -Method GET -Headers @{Metadata="true"}
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The value of the "resource" parameter must be an exact match for what is expected by Azure AD. When using the Azure Resource Manager resource ID, you must include the trailing slash on the URI.
    
   Next, extract the "Content" element, which is stored as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted string in the $response object. 
    
   ```powershell
   $content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```
   Next, extract the access token from the response.
    
   ```powershell
   $ArmToken = $content.access_token
   ```

## Get access keys from Azure Resource Manager to make Cosmos DB calls

Now use PowerShell to call Resource Manager using the access token retrieved in the previous section to retrieve the Cosmos DB account access key. Once we have the access key, we can query Cosmos DB. Be sure to replace the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>`, `<RESOURCE GROUP>`, and `<COSMOS DB ACCOUNT NAME>` parameter values with your own values. Replace the `<ACCESS TOKEN>` value with the access token you retrieved earlier.  If you want to retrieve read/write keys, use key operation type `listKeys`.  If you want to retrieve read-only keys, use the key operation type `readonlykeys`:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION-ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/<COSMOS DB ACCOUNT NAME>/listKeys/?api-version=2016-03-31' -Method POST -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $ARMToken"}
```
The response give you the list of Keys.  For example, if you get read-only keys:

```powershell
{"primaryReadonlyMasterKey":"bWpDxS...dzQ==",
"secondaryReadonlyMasterKey":"38v5ns...7bA=="}
```
Now that you have the access key for the Cosmos DB account you can pass it to a Cosmos DB SDK and make calls to access the account.  For a quick example, you can pass the access key to the Azure CLI.  You can get the `<COSMOS DB CONNECTION URL>` from the **Overview** tab on the Cosmos DB account blade in the Azure portal.  Replace the `<ACCESS KEY>` with the value you obtained above:

```bash
az cosmosdb collection show -c <COLLECTION ID> -d <DATABASE ID> --url-connection "<COSMOS DB CONNECTION URL>" --key <ACCESS KEY>
```

This CLI command returns details about the collection:

```bash
