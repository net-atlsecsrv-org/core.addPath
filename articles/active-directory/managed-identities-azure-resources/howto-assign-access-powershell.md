# Assign a managed identity access to a resource using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Once you've configured an Azure resource with a managed identity, you can give the managed identity access to another resource, just like any security principal. This example shows you how to give an Azure virtual machine's managed identity access to an Azure storage account using PowerShell.

[!INCLUDE [az-powershell-update](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- To run the example scripts, you have two options:
    - Use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), which you can open using the **Try It** button on the top right corner of code blocks.
    - Run scripts locally by installing the latest version of [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps), then sign in to Azure using `Connect-AzAccount`. 

## Use Azure RBAC to assign a managed identity access to another resource

1. Enable managed identity on an Azure resource, [such as an Azure VM](qs-configure-powershell-windows-vm.md).

1. In this example, we are giving an Azure VM access to a storage account. First we use [Get-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm) to get the service principal for the VM named `myVM`, which was created when we enabled managed identity. Then, use [New-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/New-AzRoleAssignment) to give the VM **Reader** access to a storage account called `myStorageAcct`:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    $spID = (Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myRG -Name myVM).identity.principalid
    New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $spID -RoleDefinitionName "Reader" -Scope "/subscriptions/<mySubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<myStorageAcct>"
    ```
