# FAQs and known issues with managed identities for Azure resources

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice.md)]

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

> [!NOTE]
> Managed identities for Azure resources is the new name for the service formerly known as Managed Service Identity (MSI).


### How can you find resources that have a managed identity?

You can find the list of resources that have a system-assigned managed identity by using the following Azure CLI Command: 

`az resource list --query "[?identity.type=='SystemAssigned'].{Name:name,  principalId:identity.principalId}" --output table`




### Do managed identities have a backing app object?

No. Managed identities and Azure AD App Registrations are not the same thing in the directory. 

App registrations have two components: An Application Object + A Service Principal Object. 
Managed Identities for Azure resources have only one of those components: A Service Principal Object. 

Managed identities don't have an application object in the directory, which is what is commonly used to grant app permissions for MS graph. Instead, MS graph permissions for managed identities need to be granted directly to the Service Principal.  

### Does managed identities for Azure resources work with Azure Cloud Services?

No, there are no plans to support managed identities for Azure resources in Azure Cloud Services.

### What is the credential associated with a managed identity? How long is it valid and how often is it rotated?

> [!NOTE]
> How managed identities authenticate is an internal implementation detail that is subject to change without notice.

Managed identities use certificate-based authentication. Each managed identity’s credential has an expiration of 90 days and it is rolled after 45 days.

### What is the security boundary of managed identities for Azure resources?

The security boundary of the identity is the resource to which it is attached to. For example, the security boundary for a Virtual Machine with managed identities for Azure resources enabled, is the Virtual Machine. Any code running on that VM, is able to call the managed identities for Azure resources endpoint and request tokens. It is the similar experience with other resources that support managed identities for Azure resources.

### What identity will IMDS default to if don't specify the identity in the request?

- If system assigned managed identity is enabled and no identity is specified in the request, IMDS will default to the system assigned managed identity.
- If system assigned managed identity is not enabled, and only one user assigned managed identity exists, IMDS will default to that single user assigned managed identity. 
- If system assigned managed identity is not enabled, and multiple user assigned managed identities exist, then specifying a managed identity in the request is required.



### Will managed identities be recreated automatically if I move a subscription to another directory?

No. If you move a subscription to another directory, you will have to manually re-create them and grant Azure role assignments again.
- For system assigned managed identities: disable and re-enable. 
- For user assigned managed identities: delete, re-create and attach them again to the necessary resources (e.g. virtual machines)

### Can I use a managed identity to access a resource in a different directory/tenant?

No. Managed identities do not currently support cross-directory scenarios. 

### What Azure RBAC permissions are required to managed identity on a resource? 

- System-assigned managed identity: You need write permissions over the resource. For example, for virtual machines you need Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write. This action is included in resource specific built-in roles like [Virtual Machine Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor).
- User-assigned managed identity: You need write permissions over the resource. For example, for virtual machines you need Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write. In addition to [Managed Identity Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) role assignment over the managed identity.



## Known issues

### "Automation script" fails when attempting schema export for managed identities for Azure resources extension

When managed identities for Azure resources is enabled on a VM, the following error is shown when attempting to use the “Automation script” feature for the VM, or its resource group:

![Managed identities for Azure resources automation script export error](./media/msi-known-issues/automation-script-export-error.png)

The managed identities for Azure resources VM extension (planned for deprecation in January 2019) does not currently support the ability to export its schema to a resource group template. As a result, the generated template does not show configuration parameters to enable managed identities for Azure resources on the resource. These sections can be added manually by following the examples in [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on an Azure VM using a templates](qs-configure-template-windows-vm.md).

When the schema export functionality becomes available for the managed identities for Azure resources VM extension (planned for deprecation in January 2019), it will be listed in [Exporting Resource Groups that contain VM extensions](../../virtual-machines/extensions/export-templates.md#supported-virtual-machine-extensions).

### VM fails to start after being moved from resource group or subscription

If you move a VM in the running state, it continues to run during the move. However, after the move, if the VM is stopped and restarted, it will fail to start. This issue happens because the VM is not updating the reference to the managed identities for Azure resources identity and continues to point to it in the old resource group.

**Workaround** 
 
Trigger an update on the VM so it can get correct values for the managed identities for Azure resources. You can do a VM property change to update the reference to the managed identities for Azure resources identity. For example, you can set a new tag value on the VM with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
 az  vm update -n <VM Name> -g <Resource Group> --set tags.fixVM=1
```
 
This command sets a new tag "fixVM" with a value of 1 on the VM. 
 
By setting this property, the VM updates with the correct managed identities for Azure resources resource URI, and then you should be able to start the VM. 
 
Once the VM is started, the tag can be removed by using following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az vm update -n <VM Name> -g <Resource Group> --remove tags.fixVM
```



### Transferring a subscription between Azure AD directories

Managed identities do not get updated when a subscription is moved/transferred to another directory. As a result, any existent system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities will be broken. 

Workaround for managed identities in a subscription that has been moved to another directory:

 - For system assigned managed identities: disable and re-enable. 
 - For user assigned managed identities: delete, re-create and attach them again to the necessary resources (e.g. virtual machines)

For more information, see [Transfer an Azure subscription to a different Azure AD directory (Preview)](../../role-based-access-control/transfer-subscription.md).

### Moving a user-assigned managed identity to a different resource group/subscription

Moving a user-assigned managed identity to a different resource group is not supported.
