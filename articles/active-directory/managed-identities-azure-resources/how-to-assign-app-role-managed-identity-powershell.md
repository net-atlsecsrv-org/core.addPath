# Assign a managed identity access to an application role using PowerShell

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an identity in Azure Active Directory. They work without needing credentials in your code. Azure services use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication. Application roles provide a form of role-based access control, and allow a service to implement authorization rules.

In this article, you learn how to assign a managed identity to an application role exposed by another application using Azure AD PowerShell.

[!INCLUDE [az-powershell-update](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- To run the example scripts, you have two options:
    - Use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), which you can open using the **Try It** button on the top-right corner of code blocks.
    - Run scripts locally by installing the latest version of [Azure AD PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2).

## Assign a managed identity access to another application's app role

1. Enable managed identity on an Azure resource, [such as an Azure VM](qs-configure-powershell-windows-vm.md).

1. Find the object ID of the managed identity's service principal.

   **For a system-assigned managed identity**, you can find the object ID on the Azure portal on the resource's **Identity** page. You can also use the following PowerShell script to find the object ID. You'll need the resource ID of the resource you created in step 1, which is available in the Azure portal on the resource's **Properties** page.

    ```powershell
    $resourceIdWithManagedIdentity = '/subscriptions/{my subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{my resource group name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{my virtual machine name}'
    (Get-AzResource -ResourceId $resourceIdWithManagedIdentity).Identity.PrincipalId
    ```

    **For a user-assigned managed identity**, you can find the managed identity's object ID on the Azure portal on the resource's **Overview** page. You can also use the following PowerShell script to find the object ID. You'll need the resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity.

    ```powershell
    $userManagedIdentityResourceId = '/subscriptions/{my subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{my resource group name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{my managed identity name}'
    (Get-AzResource -ResourceId $userManagedIdentityResourceId).Properties.PrincipalId
    ```

1. Create a new application registration to represent the service that your managed identity will send a request to. If the API or service that exposes the app role grant to the managed identity already has a service principal in your Azure AD tenant, skip this step. For example, if you want to grant the managed identity access to the Microsoft Graph API, you can skip this step.

1. Find the object ID of the service application's service principal. You can find this using the Azure portal. Go to Azure Active Directory and open the **Enterprise applications** page, then find the application and look for the **Object ID**. You can also find the service principal's object ID by its display name using the following PowerShell script:

    ```powershell
    $serverServicePrincipalObjectId = (Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "DisplayName eq '$applicationName'").ObjectId
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Display names for applications are not unique, so you should verify that you obtain the correct application's service principal.

1. Add an [app role](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to the application you created in step 3. You can create the role using the Azure portal or using Microsoft Graph. For example, you could add an app role like this:

    ```json
    {
        "allowedMemberTypes": [
            "Application"
        ],
        "displayName": "Read data from MyApi",
        "id": "0566419e-bb95-4d9d-a4f8-ed9a0f147fa6",
        "isEnabled": true,
        "description": "Allow the application to read data as itself.",
        "value": "MyApi.Read.All"
    }
    ```

1. Assign the app role to the managed identity. You'll need the following information to assign the app role:
    * `managedIdentityObjectId`: the object ID of the managed identity's service principal, which you found in step 2.
    * `serverServicePrincipalObjectId`: the object ID of the server application's service principal, which you found in step 4.
    * `appRoleId`: the ID of the app role exposed by the server app, which you generated in step 5 - in the example, the app role ID is `0566419e-bb95-4d9d-a4f8-ed9a0f147fa6`.
   
   Execute the following PowerShell script to add the role assignment:

    ```powershell
    New-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $managedIdentityObjectId -Id $appRoleId -PrincipalId $managedIdentityObjectId -ResourceId $serverServicePrincipalObjectId
    ```

## Complete script

This example script shows how to assign an Azure web app's managed identity to an app role.

```powershell
# Install the module. (You need admin on the machine.)
# Install-Module AzureAD

# Your tenant ID (in the Azure portal, under Azure Active Directory > Overview).
$tenantID = '<tenant-id>'

# The name of your web app, which has a managed identity that should be assigned to the server app's app role.
$webAppName = '<web-app-name>'
$resourceGroupName = '<resource-group-name-containing-web-app>'

# The name of the server app that exposes the app role.
$serverApplicationName = '<server-application-name>' # For example, MyApi

# The name of the app role that the managed identity should be assigned to.
$appRoleName = '<app-role-name>' # For example, MyApi.Read.All

# Look up the web app's managed identity's object ID.
$managedIdentityObjectId = (Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $webAppName).identity.principalid

Connect-AzureAD -TenantId $tenantID

# Look up the details about the server app's service principal and app role.
$serverServicePrincipal = (Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "DisplayName eq '$serverApplicationName'")
$serverServicePrincipalObjectId = $serverServicePrincipal.ObjectId
$appRoleId = ($serverServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $appRoleName }).Id

# Assign the managed identity access to the app role.
New-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment `
    -ObjectId $managedIdentityObjectId `
    -Id $appRoleId `
    -PrincipalId $managedIdentityObjectId `
    -ResourceId $serverServicePrincipalObjectId
```
