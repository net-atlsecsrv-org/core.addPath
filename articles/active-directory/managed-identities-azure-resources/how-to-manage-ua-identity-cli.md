# Create, list or delete a user-assigned managed identity using the Azure CLI


Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with a managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication, without needing credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete a user-assigned managed identity using Azure CLI.

If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](overview.md). To learn about system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity types, see [Managed identity types](overview.md#managed-identity-types).

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

> [!NOTE]	
> In order to modify user permissions when using an app service principal using CLI you must provide the service principal additional permissions in Azure AD Graph API as portions of CLI perform GET requests against the Graph API. Otherwise, you may end up receiving a 'Insufficient privileges to complete the operation' message. To do this you will need to go into the App registration in Azure Active Directory, select your app, click on API permissions, scroll down and select Azure Active Directory Graph. From there select Application permissions, and then add the appropriate permissions. 

## Create a user-assigned managed identity 

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

Use the [az identity create](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-create) command to create a user-assigned managed identity. The `-g` parameter specifies the resource group where to create the user-assigned managed identity, and the `-n` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values:

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
az identity create -g <RESOURCE GROUP> -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```
## List user-assigned managed identities

To list/read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To list user-assigned managed identities, use the [az identity list](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-list) command. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` with your own value:

```azurecli-interactive
az identity list -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
```

In the json response, user-assigned managed identities have `"Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"` value returned for key, `type`.

`"type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"`

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, use the [az identity delete](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-delete) command.  The -n parameter specifies its name and the -g parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned managed identity was created. Replace the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` and `<RESOURCE GROUP>` parameters values with your own values:

```azurecli-interactive
az identity delete -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME> -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
```
> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a user-assigned managed identity will not remove the reference, from any resource it was assigned to. Please remove those from VM/VMSS using the `az vm/vmss identity remove` command

## Next steps
