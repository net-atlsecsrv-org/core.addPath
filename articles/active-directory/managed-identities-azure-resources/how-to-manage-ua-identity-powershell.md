# Create, list, or delete a user-assigned managed identity using Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](~/includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice-ua.md)]

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with a managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication, without needing credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete a user-assigned managed identity using Azure PowerShell.

[!INCLUDE [az-powershell-update](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). **Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)**.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- To run the example scripts, you have two options:
    - Use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), which you can open using the **Try It** button on the top right corner of code blocks.
    - Run scripts locally with Azure PowerShell, as described in the next section.

### Configure Azure PowerShell locally

To use Azure PowerShell locally for this article (rather than using Cloud Shell), complete the following steps:

1. Install [the latest version of Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) if you haven't already.

1. Sign in to Azure:

    ```azurepowershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Install the [latest version of PowerShellGet](/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget#for-systems-with-powershell-50-or-newer-you-can-install-the-latest-powershellget).

    ```azurepowershell
    Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -AllowPrerelease
    ```

    You may need to `Exit` out of the current PowerShell session after you run this command for the next step.

1. Install the prerelease version of the `Az.ManagedServiceIdentity` module to perform the user-assigned managed identity operations in this article:

    ```azurepowershell
    Install-Module -Name Az.ManagedServiceIdentity -AllowPrerelease
    ```

## Create a user-assigned managed identity

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To create a user-assigned managed identity, use the `New-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command. The `ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where to create the user-assigned managed identity, and the `-Name` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values:

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

 ```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCEGROUP> -Name <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```
## List user-assigned managed identities

To list/read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To list user-assigned managed identities, use the [Get-AzUserAssigned] command.  The `-ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned managed identity was created. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` with your own value:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP>
```
In the response, user-assigned managed identities have `"Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"` value returned for key, `Type`.

`Type :Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities`

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, use the `Remove-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command.  The `-ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned identity was created and the `-Name` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameters values with your own values:

 ```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP> -Name <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```
> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a user-assigned managed identity will not remove the reference, from any resource it was assigned to. Identity assignments need to be removed separately.
