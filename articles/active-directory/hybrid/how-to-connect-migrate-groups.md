# Migrate groups from one forest to another for Azure AD Connect

This article describes the steps needed to successfully migrate groups from one forest to another so that the migrated group objects match to the existing objects in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

- Azure AD Connect version 1.5.18.0 or higher
- Source Anchor attribute is `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid`

Starting from version 1.5.18.0, Azure AD Connect has started supporting the use of `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` for groups. If `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` is chosen as the source anchor attribute and the value is populated in AD, Azure AD Connect uses the value of `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` as the immutableId. Otherwise, it falls back to using `objectGUID`. However, please note that Azure AD Connect **DOES NOT** write back the value to the `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` attribute in AD.

During a cross-forest move scenario where a group object is moving from one forest (say F1) to another forest (say F2), we will need to copy over either the `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` value (If PRESENT) or `objectGUID` value from the object in forest F1 to the `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` attribute of the object in F2. 

Please use the following scripts as guideline to see how you can migrate a single group from forest F1 to forest F2. Please feel free to use this as a guideline to do the migration for multiple groups.

First, we get the `objectGUID` and `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` of group object in forest F1. These attributes are exported to a CSV file.
```
<#
DESCRIPTION
============
This script will take DN of a group as input.
It then copies the objectGUID and mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid values along with other attributes of the given group to a CSV file.

This CSV file can then be used as input to Export-Group script
#>
Param(
       [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
       [string]
       $dn,

       [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
       [string]
       $outputCsv
)

$defaultProperties = @('samAccountName', 'distinguishedName', 'objectGUID', 'mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid')
$group  = Get-ADGroup -Filter "DistinguishedName -eq '$dn'" -Properties $defaultProperties -ErrorAction Stop
$results = @()
if ($group -eq $null)
{
       Write-Error "Group not found"
}
else
{
       $objectGUIDValue = [GUID]$group.'objectGUID'
       $mSDSConsistencyGuidValue = "N/A"
       if ($group.'mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid' -ne $null)
       {
              $mSDSConsistencyGuidValue = [GUID]$group.'mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid'
       }
       $adgroup = New-Object -TypeName PSObject
       $adgroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name samAccountName -Value $($group.'samAccountName')
       $adgroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name distinguishedName -Value $($group.'distinguishedName')
       $adgroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name objectGUID -Value $($objectGUIDValue)
       $adgroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid -Value $($mSDSConsistencyGuidValue)
       $results += $adgroup
}

Write-Host "Exporting group to output file"
$results | Export-Csv "$outputCsv" -NoTypeInformation

```

Next, we use the generated output CSV file to stamp the `mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid` attribute on the target object in forest F2.


```
<#
DESCRIPTION
============
This script will take DN of a group as input and the CSV file that was generated by Import-Group script
It copies either the objectGUID or mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid value from CSV file to the given object.

Param(
       [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
       [string]
       $dn,

       [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
       [string]
       $inputCsv
)

$group  = Get-ADGroup -Filter "DistinguishedName -eq '$dn'" -ErrorAction Stop
if ($group -eq $null)
{
       Write-Error "Group not found"
}

$csvFile = Import-Csv -Path $inputCsv -ErrorAction Stop
$msDSConsistencyGuid = $csvFile.'mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid'
$objectGuid = [GUID] $csvFile.'objectGUID'
$targetGuid = $msDSConsistencyGuid

if ($msDSConsistencyGuid -eq "N/A")
{
       $targetGuid = $objectGuid
}

Set-ADGroup -Identity $dn -Replace @{'mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid'=$targetGuid} -ErrorAction Stop

```
