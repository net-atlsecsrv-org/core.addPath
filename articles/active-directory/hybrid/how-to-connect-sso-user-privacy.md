# User Privacy and Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-On

[!INCLUDE [Privacy](../../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## Overview


Azure AD Seamless SSO creates the following log type, which can contain Personal Data: 

- Azure AD Connect trace log files.

Improve user privacy for Seamless SSO in two ways:

1.	Upon request, extract data for a person and remove data from that person from the installations.
2.	Ensure no data is retained beyond 48 hours.

We strongly recommend the second option as it is easier to implement and maintain. See following instructions for each log type:

### Delete Azure AD Connect trace log files

Check the contents of **%ProgramData%\AADConnect** folder and delete the trace log contents (**trace-\*.log** files) of this folder within 48 hours of installing or upgrading Azure AD Connect or modifying Seamless SSO configuration, as this action may create data covered by GDPR.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Donâ€™t delete the **PersistedState.xml** file in this folder, as this file is used to maintain the state of the previous installation of Azure AD Connect and is used when an upgrade installation is done. This file will never contain any data about a person and should never be deleted.

You can either review and delete these trace log files using Windows Explorer or you can use the following PowerShell script to perform the necessary actions:

```powershell
$Files = ((Get-Item -Path "$env:programdata\aadconnect\trace-*.log").VersionInfo).FileName 
 
Foreach ($file in $Files) { 
    {Remove-Item -Path $File -Force} 
}
```

Save the script in a file with the ".PS1" extension. Run this script as needed.
