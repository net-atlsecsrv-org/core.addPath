# Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization
The Azure Active Directory Connect synchronization services (Azure AD Connect sync) is a main component of Azure AD Connect. It takes care of all the operations that are related to synchronize identity data between your on-premises environment and Azure AD. Azure AD Connect sync is the successor of DirSync, Azure AD Sync, and Forefront Identity Manager with the Azure Active Directory Connector configured.

This topic is the home for **Azure AD Connect sync** (also called **sync engine**) and lists links to all other topics related to it. For links to Azure AD Connect, see [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](whatis-hybrid-identity.md).

The sync service consists of two components, the on-premises **Azure AD Connect sync** component and the service side in Azure AD called **Azure AD Connect sync service**.
