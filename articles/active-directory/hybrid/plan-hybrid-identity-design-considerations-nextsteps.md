# Azure Active Directory hybrid identity design considerations- next steps
Now that you’ve completed defining your requirements and examining all the options for your mobile device management solution, you’re ready to take the next steps for deploying the supporting infrastructure that’s right for you and your organization.

## Hybrid identity solutions
-Leveraging specific solution scenarios that fit your needs is a great way to review and plan for the details of deploying a mobile device management infrastructure. The following solutions outline several of the most common mobile device management scenarios:

* The [manage mobile devices and PCs in enterprise environments solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn582037.aspx) helps you manage mobile devices by extending your on-premises System Center 2012 Configuration Manager infrastructure into the cloud with Microsoft Intune. This hybrid infrastructure helps IT Pros in medium and large environments enable BYOD and remote access while reducing administrative complexity.
* The [managing mobile devices for Configuration Manager 2007 solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn508400.aspx) helps you manage mobile devices when your infrastructure rests on a System Center Configuration Manager 2007. This solution shows you how to set up a single server running System Center 2012 Configuration Manager so you can then run Microsoft Intune and take advantage of its MDM ability.
* The [managing mobile devices in small environments solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn715906.aspx) is intended for small businesses that need to support MDM. It explains how to use Microsoft Intune to extend your current infrastructure to support mobile device management and BYOD. This solution describes the simplest scenario supported for using Microsoft Intune in a standalone, cloud-only configuration with no local servers.

## Hybrid identity documentation
Conceptual and procedural planning, deployment, and administration content are useful when implementing your mobile device management solution:

* [Microsoft System Center](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc507089.aspx) solutions can help you capture and aggregate knowledge about your infrastructure, policies, processes, and best practices so that your IT staff can build manageable systems and automate operations.
* [Microsoft Intune](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj676587.aspx) is a cloud-based device management service that helps you to manage your computers and mobile devices and to secure your company’s information.
* [MDM for Office 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ms.o365.cc.devicepolicy.aspx) allows you to manage and secure mobile devices when they're connected to your Office 365 organization. You can use MDM for Office 365 to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices if they’re lost or stolen.

## Hybrid identity resources
Monitoring the following resources often provides the latest news and updates on mobile device management solutions:
