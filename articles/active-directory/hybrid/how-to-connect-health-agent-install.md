# Azure AD Connect Health Agent Installation

This document walks you through installing and configuring the Azure AD Connect Health Agents. You can download the agents from [here](how-to-connect-install-roadmap.md#download-and-install-azure-ad-connect-health-agent).

## Requirements

The following table is a list of requirements for using Azure AD Connect Health.

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Azure AD Premium |Azure AD Connect Health is an Azure AD Premium feature and requires Azure AD Premium. <br /><br />For more information, see [Getting started with Azure AD Premium](../fundamentals/active-directory-get-started-premium.md) <br />To start a free 30-day trial, see [Start a trial.](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/) |
| You must be a global administrator of your Azure AD to get started with Azure AD Connect Health |By default, only the global administrators can install and configure the health agents to get started, access the portal, and perform any operations within Azure AD Connect Health. For more information, see [Administering your Azure AD directory](../fundamentals/active-directory-administer.md). <br /><br /> Using Role Based Access Control you can allow access to Azure AD Connect Health to other users in your organization. For more information, see [Role Based Access Control for Azure AD Connect Health.](how-to-connect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-role-based-access-control) <br /><br />**Important:** The account used when installing the agents must be a work or school account. It cannot be a Microsoft account. For more information, see [Sign up for Azure as an organization](../fundamentals/sign-up-organization.md) |
| Azure AD Connect Health Agent is installed on each targeted server | Azure AD Connect Health requires the Health Agents to be installed and configured on targeted servers to receive the data and provide the Monitoring and Analytics capabilities. <br /><br />For example, to get data from your AD FS infrastructure, the agent must be installed on the AD FS and Web Application Proxy servers. Similarly, to get data on your on-premises AD DS infrastructure, the agent must be installed on the domain controllers. <br /><br /> |
| Outbound connectivity to the Azure service endpoints | During installation and runtime, the agent requires connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. If outbound connectivity is blocked using Firewalls, ensure that the following endpoints are added to the allowed list. See [outbound connectivity endpoints](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#outbound-connectivity-to-the-azure-service-endpoints) |
|Outbound connectivity based on IP Addresses | For IP address based filtering on firewalls, refer to the [Azure IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).|
| TLS Inspection for outbound traffic is filtered or disabled | The agent registration step or data upload operations may fail if there is TLS inspection or termination for outbound traffic at the network layer. Read more about [how to setup TLS inspection](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee796230.aspx) |
| Firewall ports on the server running the agent |The agent requires the following firewall ports to be open in order for the agent to communicate with the Azure AD Health service endpoints.<br /><br /><li>TCP port 443</li><li>TCP port 5671</li> <br />Note that port 5671 is no longer required for the latest version of agent. Upgrade to the latest version so only port 443 is required. Read more about [enable firewall ports](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ms345310(v=sql.100).aspx) |
| Allow the following websites if IE Enhanced Security is enabled |If IE Enhanced Security is enabled, then the following websites must be allowed on the server that is going to have the agent installed.<br /><br /><li>https:\//login.microsoftonline.com</li><li>https:\//secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com</li><li>https:\//login.windows.net</li><li>https:\//aadcdn.msftauth.net</li><li>The federation server for your organization trusted by Azure Active Directory. For example: https:\//sts.contoso.com</li> Read more about [how to configure IE](https://support.microsoft.com/help/815141/internet-explorer-enhanced-security-configuration-changes-the-browsing). In case you have a proxy within your network , please see note below.|
| Ensure PowerShell v4.0 or newer is installed | <li>Windows Server 2008 R2 ships with PowerShell v2.0, which is insufficient for the agent. Update PowerShell as explained below under [Agent installation on Windows Server 2008 R2 Servers](#agent-installation-on-windows-server-2008-r2-servers).</li><li>Windows Server 2012 ships with PowerShell v3.0, which is insufficient for the agent.  [Update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855) the Windows Management Framework.</li><li>Windows Server 2012 R2 and later ship with a sufficiently recent version of PowerShell.</li>|
|Disable FIPS|FIPS is not supported by Azure AD Connect Health agents.|


> [!NOTE]
> If you have a highly locked-down and extremely restricted environment, you would require to whitelist the URLs mentioned in the Service endpoint lists below in addition to the ones listed in the Allowed IE enhanced Security configuration above. 
>

### Outbound connectivity to the Azure service endpoints

 During installation and runtime, the agent requires connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. If outbound connectivity is blocked using Firewalls, make sure that the following URLs are not blocked by default. Do not disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs, but allow them as you would other internet traffic. They permit communication with Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. Learn how to [check outbound connectivity with Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-agent-install#test-connectivity-to-azure-ad-connect-health-service).

## Installing the Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync

The Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync is installed automatically in the latest build of Azure AD Connect. To use Azure AD Connect for sync, you need to download the latest version of Azure AD Connect and install it. You can download the latest version [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594).

To verify the agent has been installed, look for the following services on the server. If you completed the configuration, they should already be running. Otherwise, they are stopped until the configuration is complete.

* Azure AD Connect Health Sync Insights Service
* Azure AD Connect Health Sync Monitoring Service

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health for Sync](./media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/services.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that using Azure AD Connect Health requires Azure AD Premium. If you do not have Azure AD Premium, you are unable to complete the configuration in the Azure portal. For more information, see the [requirements page](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#requirements).
>
>

## Manual Azure AD Connect Health for Sync registration

If the Azure AD Connect Health for Sync agent registration fails after successfully installing Azure AD Connect, you can use the following PowerShell command to manually register the agent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using this PowerShell command is only required if the agent registration fails after installing Azure AD Connect.
>
>

The following PowerShell command is required ONLY when the health agent registration fails even after a successful installation and configuration of Azure AD Connect. The Azure AD Connect Health services will start after the agent has been successfully registered.

You can manually register the Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync using the following PowerShell command:

`Register-AzureADConnectHealthSyncAgent -AttributeFiltering $false -StagingMode $false`

The command takes following parameters:

* AttributeFiltering: $true (default) - if Azure AD Connect is not syncing the default attribute set and has been customized to use a filtered attribute set. $false otherwise.
* StagingMode: $false (default) - if the Azure AD Connect server is NOT in staging mode, $true if the server is configured to be in staging mode.

When prompted for authentication you should use the same global admin account (such as admin@domain.onmicrosoft.com) that was used for configuring Azure AD Connect.

## Installing the Azure AD Connect Health Agent for AD DS

To start the agent installation, double-click the .exe file that you downloaded. On the first screen, click Install.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install1.png)

Once the installation is finished, click Configure Now.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install2.png)

A command prompt is launched, followed by some PowerShell that executes Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent. When prompted to sign in to Azure, go ahead and sign in.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install3.png)

After signing in, PowerShell will continue. Once it completes, you can close PowerShell and the configuration is complete.

At this point, the services should be started automatically allowing the agent to monitor and gather data. If you have not met all the pre-requisites outlined in the previous sections, warnings appear in the PowerShell window. Be sure to complete the [requirements](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) before installing the agent. The following screenshot is an example of these errors.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health for AD DS](./media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install4.png)

To verify the agent has been installed, look for the following services on the domain controller.

* Azure AD Connect Health AD DS Insights Service
* Azure AD Connect Health AD DS Monitoring Service

If you completed the configuration, these services should already be running. Otherwise, they are stopped until the configuration is complete.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install5.png)

### Quick agent installation in multiple servers

1. Create a user account in Azure AD with a password.
2. Assign the **Owner** role for this local AAD account in Azure AD Connect Health via the portal. Follow the steps [here](how-to-connect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-role-based-access-control). Assign the role to all service instances. 
3. Download the .exe MSI file in local domain controller for installation.
4. Run the following script to registration. Replace the parameters with the new user account created and its password. 

```powershell
AdHealthAddsAgentSetup.exe /quiet
Start-Sleep 30
$userName = "NEWUSER@DOMAIN"
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "PASSWORD" -AsPlainText -Force
$myCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($userName, $secpasswd)
import-module "C:\Program Files\Azure Ad Connect Health Adds Agent\PowerShell\AdHealthAdds"
 
Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent -Credential $myCreds

```

1. Once you are done, you can remove access for the local account by doing one or more of the following: 
    * Remove the role assignment for the local account for AAD Connect Health
    * Rotate the password for the local account. 
    * Disable the AAD local account
    * Delete the AAD local account  

## Agent Registration using PowerShell

After installing the appropriate agent setup.exe, you can perform the agent registration step using the following PowerShell commands depending on the role. Open a PowerShell Window and execute the appropriate command:

```powershell
    Register-AzureADConnectHealthADFSAgent
    Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent
    Register-AzureADConnectHealthSyncAgent

```

These commands accept "Credential" as a parameter to complete the registration in a non-interactive manner or on a Server-Core machine.
* The Credential can be captured in a PowerShell variable that is passed as a parameter.
* You can provide any Azure AD Identity that has access to register the agents and does NOT have MFA enabled.
* By default Global Admins have access to perform agent registration. You can also allow other less privileged identities to perform this step. Read more about [Role Based Access Control](how-to-connect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-role-based-access-control).

```powershell
    $cred = Get-Credential
    Register-AzureADConnectHealthADFSAgent -Credential $cred

```

## Configure Azure AD Connect Health Agents to use HTTP Proxy

You can configure Azure AD Connect Health Agents to work with an HTTP Proxy.

> [!NOTE]
> * Using “Netsh WinHttp set ProxyServerAddress” is not supported as the agent uses System.Net to make web requests instead of Microsoft Windows HTTP Services.
> * The configured Http Proxy address is used to pass-through encrypted Https messages.
> * Authenticated proxies (using HTTPBasic) are not supported.
>
>

### Change Health Agent Proxy Configuration

You have the following options to configure Azure AD Connect Health Agent to use an HTTP Proxy.

> [!NOTE]
> All Azure AD Connect Health Agent services must be restarted, in order for the proxy settings to be updated. Run the following command:<br />
> Restart-Service AzureADConnectHealth*
>
>

#### Import existing proxy Settings

##### Import from Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer HTTP proxy settings can be imported, to be used by the Azure AD Connect Health Agents. On each of the servers running the Health agent, execute the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromInternetSettings
```

##### Import from WinHTTP

WinHTTP proxy settings can be imported, to be used by the Azure AD Connect Health Agents. On each of the servers running the Health agent, execute the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromWinHttp
```

#### Specify Proxy addresses manually

You can manually specify a proxy server on each of the servers running the Health Agent, by executing the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress address:port
```

Example: *Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress myproxyserver: 443*

* "address" can be a DNS resolvable server name or an IPv4 address
* "port" can be omitted. If omitted then 443 is chosen as default port.

#### Clear existing proxy configuration

You can clear the existing proxy configuration by running the following command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -NoProxy
```

### Read current proxy settings

You can read the currently configured proxy settings by running the following command:

```powershell
Get-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings
```

## Test Connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health Service

It is possible that issues may arise that cause the Azure AD Connect Health agent to lose connectivity with the Azure AD Connect Health service. These include network issues, permission issues, or various other reasons.

If the agent is unable to send data to the Azure AD Connect Health service for longer than two hours, it is indicated with the following alert in the portal: "Health Service data is not up to date." You can confirm if the affected Azure AD Connect Health agent is able to upload data to the Azure AD Connect Health service by running the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role ADFS
```

The role parameter currently takes the following values:

* ADFS
* Sync
* ADDS

> [!NOTE]
> To use the connectivity tool, you must first complete the agent registration. If you are not able to complete the agent registration, make sure that you have met all the [requirements](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) for Azure AD Connect Health. This connectivity test is performed by default during agent registration.
