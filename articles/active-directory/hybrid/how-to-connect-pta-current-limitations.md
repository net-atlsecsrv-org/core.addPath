# Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication: Current limitations

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Pass-through Authentication is a free feature, and you don't need any paid editions of Azure AD to use it. Pass-through Authentication is only available in the world-wide instance of Azure AD, and not on the [Microsoft Azure Germany cloud](https://www.microsoft.de/cloud-deutschland) or the [Microsoft Azure Government cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/gov/).

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are supported:

- User sign-ins to web browser-based applications.
- User sign-ins to Outlook clients using legacy protocols such as Exchange ActiveSync, EAS, SMTP, POP and IMAP.
- User sign-ins to legacy Office client applications and Office applications that support [modern authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2015/11/19/updated-office-365-modern-authentication-public-preview): Office 2013 and 2016 versions.
- User sign-ins to legacy protocol applications such as PowerShell version 1.0 and others.
- Azure AD joins for Windows 10 devices.
- App passwords for Multi-Factor Authentication.

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios are _not_ supported:

- Detection of users with [leaked credentials](../identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md).
- Azure AD Domain Services needs Password Hash Synchronization to be enabled on the tenant. Therefore tenants that use Pass-through Authentication _only_ don't work for scenarios that need Azure AD Domain Services.
- Pass-through Authentication is not integrated with [Azure AD Connect Health](./whatis-azure-ad-connect.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a workaround for unsupported scenarios _only_ (except Azure AD Connect Health integration), enable Password Hash Synchronization on the [Optional features](how-to-connect-install-custom.md#optional-features) page in the Azure AD Connect wizard.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Password Hash Synchronization gives you the option to failover authentication if your on-premises infrastructure is disrupted. This failover from Pass-through Authentication to Password Hash Synchronization is not automatic. You'll need to switch the sign-in method manually using Azure AD Connect. If the server running Azure AD Connect goes down, you'll require help from Microsoft Support to turn off Pass-through Authentication.
