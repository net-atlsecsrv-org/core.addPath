# Azure AD Connect: Version release history
The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) team regularly updates Azure AD Connect with new features and functionality. Not all additions are applicable to all audiences.


This article is designed to help you keep track of the versions that have been released, and to understand what the changes are in the latest version.

This table is a list of related topics:

Topic |  Details
--------- | --------- |
Steps to upgrade from Azure AD Connect | Different methods to [upgrade from a previous version to the latest](how-to-upgrade-previous-version.md) Azure AD Connect release.
Required permissions | For permissions required to apply an update, see [accounts and permissions](reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md#upgrade).
Download| [Download Azure AD Connect](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615771).

>[!NOTE]
>Releasing a new version of Azure AD Connect is a process that requires several quality control step to ensure the operation functionality of the service, and while we go through this process the version number of a new release as well as the release status will be updated to reflect the most recent state.
While we go through this process, the version number of the release will be shown with an "X" in the minor release number position, as in "1.3.X.0" - this indicates that the release notes in this document are valid for all versions beginning with "1.3.". As soon as we have finalized the release process the release version number will be updated to the most recently released version and the release status will be updated to "Released for download and auto upgrade".
Not all releases of Azure AD Connect will be made available for auto upgrade. The release status will indicate whether a release is made available for auto upgrade or for download only. If auto upgrade was enabled on your Azure AD Connect server then that server will automatically upgrade to the latest version of Azure AD Connect that is released for auto upgrade. Note that not all Azure AD Connect configurations are eligible for auto upgrade. Please follow this link to read more about [auto upgrade](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md)

## 1.4.38.0
### Release status
12/6/2019: Release for download. Not available through auto-upgrade.
### New features and improvements
- We updated Password Hash Sync for Azure AD Domain Services to properly account for padding in Kerberos hashes.  This will provide a performance improvement during password synchronization from AAD to Azure AD Domain Services.
- We added support for reliable sessions between the authentication agent and service bus.
- This release enforces TLS 1.2 for communication between authentication agent and cloud services.
- We added a DNS cache for websocket connections between authentication agent and cloud services.
- We added the ability to target specific agent from cloud to test for agent connectivity.

### Fixed issues
- Release 1.4.18.0 had a bug where the PowerShell cmdlet for DSSO was using the login windows credentials instead of the admin credentialss provided while running ps. As a result of which it was not possible to enable DSSO in multiple forest through the AADConnect user interface. 
- A fix was made to enable DSSO simultaneously in all forest through the AADConnect user interface

## 1.4.32.0
### Release status
11/08/2019: Released for download. Not available through auto-upgrade.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Due to an internal schema change in this release of Azure AD Connect, if you manage ADFS trust relationship configuration settings using MSOnline PowerShell then you must update your MSOnline PowerShell module to version 1.1.183.57 or higher
### Fixed issues

This version fixes an issue with existing Hybrid Azure AD joined devices. This release contains a new device sync rule that corrects this issue.
Note that this rule change may cause deletion of obsolete devices from Azure AD. This is not a cause for concern, as these device objects are not used by Azure AD during Conditional Access authorization. For some customers, the number of devices that will be deleted through this rule change can exceed the deletion threshold. If you see the deletion of device objects in Azure AD exceeding the Export Deletion Threshold, it is advised to allow the deletions to go through. [How to allow deletes to flow when they exceed the deletion threshold](how-to-connect-sync-feature-prevent-accidental-deletes.md)

## 1.4.25.0

### Release status
9/28/2019: Released for auto-upgrade to select tenants. Not available for download.

This version fixes a bug where some servers that were auto-upgraded from a previous version to 1.4.18.0 and experienced issues with Self-service password reset (SSPR) and Password Writeback.

### Fixed issues

Under certain circumstances, servers that were auto upgraded to version 1.4.18.0 did not re-enable Self-service password reset and Password Writeback after the upgrade was completed. This auto upgrade release fixes that issue and re-enables Self-service password reset and Password Writeback.

## 1.4.18.0

>[!WARNING]
>We are investigating an incident where some customers are experiencing an issue with existing Hybrid Azure AD joined devices after upgrading to this version of Azure AD Connect. We advise customers who have deployed Hybrid Azure AD join to postpone upgrading to this version until the root cause of these issues are fully understood and mitigated. More information will be provided as soon as possible.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>With this version of Azure AD Connect some customers may see some or all of their Windows devices disappear from Azure AD. This is not a cause for concern, as these device identities are not used by Azure AD during Conditional Access authorization. For more information see [Understanding Azure AD Connect 1.4.xx.x device disappearnce](reference-connect-device-disappearance.md)


### Release status
9/25/2019: Released for auto-upgrade only.

### New features and improvements
- New troubleshooting tooling helps troubleshoot "user not syncing", "group not syncing" or "group member not syncing" scenarios.
- Add support for national clouds in AAD Connect troubleshooting script 
- Customers should be informed that the deprecated WMI endpoints for MIIS_Service have now been removed. Any WMI operations should now be done via PS cmdlets.
- Security improvement by resetting constrained delegation on AZUREADSSOACC object
- When adding/editing a sync rule, if there are any attributes used in the rule that are in the connector schema but not added to the connector, the attributes automatically added to the connector. The same is true for the object type the rule affects. If anything is added to the connector, the connector will be marked for full import on the next sync cycle.
- Using an Enterprise or Domain admin as the connector account is no longer supported in new AAD Connect Deployments. Current AAD Connect deployments using an Enterprise or Domain admin as the connector account will not be affected by this release.
- In the Synchronization Manager a full sync is run on rule creation/edit/deletion. A popup will appear on any rule change notifying the user if full import or full sync is going to be run.
- Added mitigation steps for password errors to 'connectors > properties > connectivity' page
- Added a deprecation warning for the sync service manager on the connector properties page. This warning notifies the user that changes should be made through the AADC wizard.
- Added new error for issues with a user's password policy.
- Prevent misconfiguration of  group filtering by domain and OU filters. Group filtering will show an error when the domain/OU of the entered group is already filtered out and keep the user from moving forward until the issue is resolved.
- Users can no longer create a connector for Active Directory Domain Services or Windows Azure Active Directory in the Synchronization Service Manager UI.
- Fixed accessibility of custom UI controls in the Synchronization Service Manager.
- Enabled six federation management tasks for all sign-in methods in Azure AD Connect.  (Previously, only the “Update AD FS SSL certificate” task was available for all sign-ins.)
- Added a warning when changing the sign-in method from federation to PHS or PTA that all Azure AD domains and users will be converted to managed authentication.
- Removed token-signing certificates from the “Reset Azure AD and AD FS trust” task and added a separate sub-task to update these certificates.
- Added a new federation management task called “Manage certificates” which has sub-tasks to update the SSL or token-signing certificates for the AD FS farm.
- Added a new federation management sub-task called “Specify primary server” which allows administrators to specify a new primary server for the AD FS farm.
- Added a new federation management task called “Manage servers” which has sub-tasks to deploy an AD FS server, deploy a Web Application Proxy server, and specify primary server.
- Added a new federation management task called “View federation configuration” that displays the current AD FS settings.  (Because of this addition, AD FS settings have been removed from the “Review your solution” page.)

### Fixed issues
- Resolved sync error issue for the scenario where a user object taking over its corresponding contact object has a self-reference (e.g. user is their own manager).
- Help popups now show on keyboard focus.
- For Auto upgrade, if any conflicting app is running from 6 hours, kill it and continue with upgrade.
- Limit the number of attributes a customer can select to 100 per object when selecting directory extensions. This will prevent the error from occurring during export as Azure has a maximum of 100 extension attributes per object.
- Fixed a bug to make the AD Connectivity script more robust
- Fixed a bug to make AADConnect install on a machine using an existing Named Pipes WCF service more robust.
- Improved diagnostics and troubleshooting around group policies that do not allow the ADSync service to start when initially installed.
- Fixed a bug where display name for a Windows computer was written incorrectly.
- Fix a bug where OS type for a Windows computer was written incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug where non-Windows 10 computers were syncing unexpectedly. Note that the effect of this change is that non-Windows-10 computers that were previously synced will now be deleted. This does not affect any features as the sync of Windows computers is only used for Hybrid Azure AD domain join, which only works for Windows-10 devices.
- Added several new (internal) cmdlets to the ADSync PowerShell module.


## 1.3.21.0
>[!IMPORTANT]
>There is a known issue with upgrading Azure AD Connect from an earlier version to 1.3.21.0 where the O365 portal does not reflect the updated version even though Azure AD Connect upgraded successfully.
>
> To resolve this you need to import the **AdSync** module and then run the`Set-ADSyncDirSyncConfiguration` powershell cmdlet on the Azure AD Connect server.  You can use the following steps:
>
>1.	Open Powershell in administator mode
>2.	Run `Import-Module "ADSync"`
>3.	Run `Set-ADSyncDirSyncConfiguration -AnchorAttribute ""`
 
### Release status 

05/14/2019: Released for download

### Fixed issues 

- Fixed an elevation of privilege vulnerability that exists in Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect build 1.3.20.0.  This vulnerability, under certain conditions, may allow an attacker to execute two powershell cmdlets in the context of a privileged account, and perform privileged actions.  This security update addresses the issue by disabling these cmdlets. For more information see [security update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1000).

## 1.3.20.0

- Modified Default Sync Rule Handling – read more [here](how-to-connect-fix-default-rules.md).
- Added a new agent running as a windows service. This agent, named “Admin Agent”, enables deeper remote diagnostics of the Azure AD Connect server to help Microsoft Engineers troubleshoot when you open a support case. This agent is not installed and enabled by default.  For more information on how to install and enable the agent see [What is the Azure AD Connect Admin Agent?](whatis-aadc-admin-agent.md). 
- Updated the End User License Agreement (EULA) 
- Added auto upgrade support for deployments that use AD FS as their login type.  This also removed the requirement of updating the AD FS Azure AD Relying Party Trust as part of the upgrade process. 
- Added an Azure AD trust management task that provides two options: analyze/update trust and reset trust. 
- Changed the AD FS Azure AD Relying Party trust behavior so that it always uses the -SupportMultipleDomain switch (includes trust and Azure AD domain updates). 
- Changed the install new AD FS farm behavior so that it requires a .pfx certificate by removing the option of using a pre-installed certificate.

## 1.2.70.0

### Release status

12/18/2018: Released for download

### Fixed issues

This build updates the non-standard connectors (for example, Generic LDAP Connector and Generic SQL Connector) shipped with Azure AD Connect. For more information on applicable connectors, see version 1.1.911.0 in [Connector Version Release History](/microsoft-identity-manager/reference/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-version-history).


## 1.2.69.0

### Release status
12/11/2018: Released for download

### Fixed issues
This hotfix build allows the user to select a target domain, within the specified forest, for the RegisteredDevices container when enabling device writeback.  In the previous versions that contain the new Device Options functionality (1.1.819.0 – 1.2.68.0), the RegisteredDevices container location was limited to the forest root and did not allow child domains.  This limitation only manifested itself on new deployments – in-place upgrades were unaffected.  

If any build containing the updated Device Options functionality was deployed to a new server and device writeback was enabled, you will need to manually specify the location of the container if you do not want it in the forest root.  To do this, you need to disable device writeback and re-enable it which will allow you to specify the container location on the “Writeback forest” page.



## 1.2.68.0

### Release status 

11/30/2018:  Released for download

### Fixed issues

This hotfix build fixes a conflict where an authentication error might occur due to the independent presence of the MSOnline PowerShell Gallery module on the synchronization server.



## 1.2.67.0

### Release status 

11/19/2018:  Released for download

### Fixed issues

This hotfix build fixes a regression in the previous build where Password Writeback fails when using an ADDS Domain Controller on Windows Server 2008/R2.

## 1.2.65.0 

### Release status 

10/25/2018:  released for download

 
### New features and improvements 


- Changed the  functionality of attribute write-back to ensure hosted voice-mail is working as expected.  Under certain scenarios, Azure AD was overwriting the msExchUcVoicemailSettings attribute during write-back with a null value.  Azure AD will now no longer clear the on-premises value of this attribute if the cloud value is not set.
- Added diagnostics in the Azure AD Connect wizard to investigate and identify Connectivity issues to Azure AD. These same diagnostics can also be run directly through Powershell using the Test- AdSyncAzureServiceConnectivity Cmdlet. 
- Added diagnostics in the Azure AD Connect wizard to investigate and identify Connectivity issues to AD. These same diagnostics can also be run directly through Powershell using the Start-ConnectivityValidation function in the ADConnectivityTools Powershell module.  For more information see [What is the ADConnectivityTool PowerShell Module?](how-to-connect-adconnectivitytools.md)
- Added an AD schema version pre-check for Hybrid Azure Active Directory Join and device write-back 
- Changed the Directory Extension page attribute search to be non-case sensitive.
-	Added full support for TLS 1.2. This release supports all other protocols being disabled and only TLS 1.2 being enabled on the machine where Azure AD Connect is installed.  For more information see [TLS 1.2 enforcement for Azure AD Connect](reference-connect-tls-enforcement.md)

 

### Fixed issues   

- Fixed a bug where Azure AD Connect Upgrade would fail if SQL Always On was being used. 
- Fixed a bug to correctly parse OU names that contain a forward slash. 
- Fixed an issue where Pass-Through Authentication would be disabled for a clean install in staging mode. 
- Fixed a bug that prevented the PowerShell module to be loaded when running the Troubleshooting tools 
- Fixed a bug that would block customers from using numeric values in the first character of a host name. 
- Fixed a bug where Azure AD Connect would allow invalid partitions and container selection 
- Fixed the “Invalid Password” error message when Desktop SSO is enabled. 
- Various Bug fixes for AD FS Trust Management  
- When configuring Device Writeback - fixed the schema check to look for the msDs-DeviceContainer object class (introduced on WS2012 R2)

 
## 1.1.882.0  

9/7/2018: released for download, will not be release for auto upgrade 

### Fixed issues  

Azure AD Connect Upgrade fails if SQL Always On Availability is configured for the ADSync DB. This hotfix addresses this issue and allows Upgrade to succeed. 

## 1.1.880.0

### Release status

8/21/2018: Released for download and auto upgrade. 

### New features and improvements

- The Ping Federate integration in Azure AD Connect is now available for General Availability. [Learn more about how to federated Azure AD with Ping Federate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-user-signin#federation-with-pingfederate)
- Azure AD Connect now creates the backup of Azure AD trust in AD FS every time an update is made and stores it in a separate file for easy restore if required. [Learn more about the new functionality and Azure AD trust management in Azure AD Connect](https://aka.ms/fedtrustinaadconnect).
- New troubleshooting tooling helps troubleshoot changing primary email address and hiding account from global address list
- Azure AD Connect was updated to include the latest SQL Server 2012 Native Client
- When you switch user sign-in to Password Hash Synchronization or Pass-through Authentication in the "Change user sign-in" task, the Seamless Single Sign-On checkbox is enabled by default.
- Added support for Windows Server Essentials 2019
- The Azure AD Connect Health agent was updated to the latest version 3.1.7.0
- During an upgrade, if the installer detects changes to the default sync rules, the admin is prompted with a warning before overwriting the modified rules. This will allow the user to take corrective actions and resume later. Old Behavior: If there was any modified out-of-box rule then manual upgrade was overwriting those rules without giving any warning to the user and sync scheduler was disabled without informing user. New Behavior: User will be prompted with warning before overwriting the modified out-of-box sync rules. User will have choice to stop the upgrade process and resume later after taking corrective action.
- Provide a better handling of a FIPS compliance issue, providing an error message for MD5 hash generation in a FIPS compliant environment and a link to documentation that provides a work around for this issue.
- UI update to improve federation tasks in the wizard, which are now under a separate sub group for federation. 
- All federation additional tasks are now grouped under a single sub-menu for ease of use.
- A new revamped ADSyncConfig Posh Module (AdSyncConfig.psm1) with new AD Permissions functions moved from the old ADSyncPrep.psm1 (which may be deprecated shortly)

### Fixed issues 

- Fixed a bug where the AAD Connect server would show high CPU usage after upgrading to .NET 4.7.2
- Fixed a bug that would intermittently produce an error message for an auto-resolved SQL deadlock issue
- Fixed several accessibility issues for the Sync Rules Editor and the Sync Service Manager  
- Fixed a bug where Azure AD Connect can not get registry setting information
- Fixed a bug that created issues when the user goes forward/back in the wizard
- Fixed a bug to prevent an error happening due to incorrect multi-thread handing in the wizard
- When Group Sync Filtering page encounters an LDAP error when resolving security groups, Azure AD Connect now returns the exception with full fidelity.  The root cause for the referral exception is still unknown and will be addressed by a different bug.
-  Fixed a bug where permissions for STK and NGC keys (ms-DS-KeyCredentialLink attribute on User/Device objects for WHfB) were not correctly set.     
- Fixed a bug where 'Set-ADSyncRestrictedPermissions’ was not called correctly
-  Adding support for permission granting on Group Writeback in AADConnect's installation wizard
- When changing sign in method from Password Hash Sync to AD FS, Password Hash Sync was not disabled.
- Added verification for IPv6 addresses in AD FS configuration
- Updated the notification message to inform that an existing configuration exists.
- Device writeback fails to detect container in untrusted forest. This has been updated to provide a better error message and a link to the appropriate documentation
- Deselecting an OU and then synchronization/writeback corresponding to that OU gives a generic sync error. This has been changed to create a more understandable error message.

## 1.1.819.0

### Release status

5/14/2018: Released for auto upgrade and download.

### New features and improvements

New features and improvements

- This release includes the public preview of the integration of PingFederate in Azure AD Connect.

- A new additional task “Configure device options” has been added. You can use the task to configure the following two operations: 
  - **Hybrid Azure AD join**: If your environment has an on-premises AD footprint and you also want benefit from the capabilities provided by Azure Active Directory, you can implement hybrid Azure AD joined devices. These are devices that are both, joined to your on-premises Active Directory and your Azure Active Directory.
  - **Device writeback**: Device writeback is used to enable Conditional Access based on devices to AD FS (2012 R2 or higher) protected devices

    >[!NOTE] 
    > - The option to enable device writeback from Customize synchronization options will be greyed out. 
    > -  The PowerShell module for ADPrep is deprecated with this release.

## 1.1.751.0
Status 4/12/2018: Released for download only

>[!NOTE]
>This release is a hotfix for Azure AD Connect

### Azure AD Connect sync
#### Fixed issues
Corrected an issue were automatic Azure instance discovery for China tenants was occasionally failing.  

### AD FS Management
#### Fixed issues

There was a problem in the configuration retry logic that would result in an ArgumentException stating “an item with the same key has already been added.”  This would cause all retry operations to fail.

## 1.1.750.0
Status 3/22/2018: Released for auto-upgrade and download.
>[!NOTE]
>When the upgrade to this new version completes, it will automatically trigger a full sync and full import for the Azure AD connector and a full sync for the AD connector. Since this may take some time, depending on the size of your Azure AD Connect environment, make sure that you have taken the necessary steps to support this or hold off on upgrading until you have found a convenient moment to do so.

>[!NOTE]
>“AutoUpgrade functionality was incorrectly disabled for some tenants who deployed builds later than 1.1.524.0. To ensure that your Azure AD Connect instance is still eligible for AutoUpgrade, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:
“Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade -AutoupGradeState Enabled”


### Azure AD Connect
#### Fixed issues

* Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade cmdlet would previously block Autoupgrade if auto-upgrade state is set to Suspended. This functionality has now changed so it does not block AutoUpgrade of future builds.
* Changed the **User Sign-in** page option "Password Synchronization" to "Password Hash Synchronization".  Azure AD Connect synchronizes password hashes, not passwords, so this aligns with what is actually occurring.  For more information see [Implement password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md)

## 1.1.749.0
Status: Released to select customers

>[!NOTE]
>When the upgrade to this new version completes, it will automatically trigger a full sync and full import for the Azure AD connector and a full sync for the AD connector. Since this may take some time, depending on the size of your Azure AD Connect environment, please make sure that you have taken the necessary steps to support this or hold off on upgrading until you have found a convenient moment to do so.

### Azure AD Connect
#### Fixed issues
* Fix timing window on background tasks for Partition Filtering page when switching to next page.

* Fixed a bug that caused Access violation during the ConfigDB custom action.

* Fixed a bug to recover from SQL connection timeout.

* Fixed a bug where certificates with SAN wildcards failed a prerequisite check.

* Fixed a bug which causes miiserver.exe to crash during an Azure AD connector export.

* Fixed a bug which bad password attempt logged on DC when running the Azure AD Connect wizard to change configuration.


#### New features and improvements

* Adding Privacy Settings for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  For more information see the article [here](reference-connect-user-privacy.md).

[!INCLUDE [Privacy](../../../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]  

* application telemetry - admin can switch this class of data on/off at will

* Azure AD Health data - admin must visit the health portal to control their health settings.
   Once the service policy has been changed, the agents will read and enforce it.

* Added device write-back configuration actions and a progress bar for page initialization

* Improved General Diagnostics with HTML report and full data collection in a ZIP-Text / HTML Report

* Improved the reliability of auto upgrade and added additional telemetry to ensure the health of the server can be determined

* Restrict permissions available to privileged accounts on AD Connector account

  * For new installations, the wizard will restrict the permissions that privileged accounts have on the MSOL account after creating the MSOL account.

The changes will take care of following:
1. Express Installations
2. Custom Installations with Auto-Create account
3. Changed the installer so it doesn't require SA privilege on clean install of Azure AD Connect

* Added a new utility to troubleshoot synchronization issues for a specific object. It is available under 'Troubleshoot Object Synchronization' option of Azure AD Connect Wizard Troubleshoot Additional Task. Currently, the utility checks for the following:

  * UserPrincipalName mismatch between synchronized user object and the user account in Azure AD Tenant.
  * If the object is filtered from synchronization due to domain filtering
  * If the object is filtered from synchronization due to organizational unit (OU) filtering

* Added a new utility to synchronize the current password hash stored in the on-premises Active Directory for a specific user account.

The utility does not require a password change. It is available under 'Troubleshoot Password Hash Synchronization' option of Azure AD Connect Wizard Troubleshoot Additional Task.






## 1.1.654.0
Status: December 12th, 2017

>[!NOTE]
>This release is a security related hotfix for Azure AD Connect

### Azure AD Connect
An improvement has been added to Azure AD Connect version 1.1.654.0 (and after) to ensure that the recommended permission changes described under section [Lock down access to the AD DS account](#lock) are automatically applied when Azure AD Connect creates the AD DS account. 

- When setting up Azure AD Connect, the installing administrator can either provide an existing AD DS account, or let Azure AD Connect automatically create the account. The permission changes are automatically applied to the AD DS account that is created by Azure AD Connect during setup. They are not applied to existing AD DS account provided by the installing administrator.
- For customers who have upgraded from an older version of Azure AD Connect to 1.1.654.0 (or after), the permission changes will not be retroactively applied to existing AD DS accounts created prior to the upgrade. They will only be applied to new AD DS accounts created after the upgrade. This occurs when you are adding new AD forests to be synchronized to Azure AD.

>[!NOTE]
>This release only removes the vulnerability for new installations of Azure AD Connect where the service account is created by the installation process. For existing installations, or in cases where you provide the account yourself, you should ensure that this vulnerability does not exist.

#### <a name="lock"></a> Lock down access to the AD DS account
Lock down access to the AD DS account by implementing the following permission changes in the on-premises AD:  

*	Disable inheritance on the specified object
*	Remove all ACEs on the specific object, except ACEs specific to SELF. We want to keep the default permissions intact when it comes to SELF.
*	Assign these specific permissions:

Type     | Name                          | Access               | Applies To
---------|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
Allow    | SYSTEM                        | Full Control         | This object  |
Allow    | Enterprise Admins             | Full Control         | This object  |
Allow    | Domain Admins                 | Full Control         | This object  |
Allow    | Administrators                | Full Control         | This object  |
Allow    | Enterprise Domain Controllers | List Contents        | This object  |
Allow    | Enterprise Domain Controllers | Read All Properties  | This object  |
Allow    | Enterprise Domain Controllers | Read Permissions     | This object  |
Allow    | Authenticated Users           | List Contents        | This object  |
Allow    | Authenticated Users           | Read All Properties  | This object  |
Allow    | Authenticated Users           | Read Permissions     | This object  |

To tighten the settings for the AD DS account you can run [this PowerShell script](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Prepare-Active-Directory-ef20d978). The PowerShell script will assign the permissions mentioned above to the AD DS account.

#### PowerShell script to tighten a pre-existing service account

To use the PowerShell script, to apply these settings, to a pre-existing AD DS account, (ether provided by your organization or created by a previous installation of Azure AD Connect, please download the script from the provided link above.

##### Usage:

```powershell
Set-ADSyncRestrictedPermissions -ObjectDN <$ObjectDN> -Credential <$Credential>
```

Where 

**$ObjectDN** = The Active Directory account whose permissions need to be tightened.

**$Credential** = Administrator credential that has the necessary privileges to restrict the permissions on the $ObjectDN account. These privileges are  typically held by the Enterprise or Domain administrator. Use the fully qualified domain name of the administrator account to avoid account lookup failures. Example: contoso.com\admin.

>[!NOTE] 
>$credential.UserName should be in FQDN\username format. Example: contoso.com\admin 

##### Example:

```powershell
Set-ADSyncRestrictedPermissions -ObjectDN "CN=TestAccount1,CN=Users,DC=bvtadwbackdc,DC=com" -Credential $credential 
```
### Was this vulnerability used to gain unauthorized access?

To see if this vulnerability was used to compromise your Azure AD Connect configuration you should verify the last password reset date of the service account.  If the timestamp in unexpected, further investigation, via the event log, for that password reset event, should be undertaken.

For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 4056318](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/4056318)

## 1.1.649.0
Status: October 27 2017

>[!NOTE]
>This build is not available to customers through the Azure AD Connect Auto Upgrade feature.

### Azure AD Connect
#### Fixed issue
* Fixed a version compatibility issue between Azure AD Connect and Azure AD Connect Health Agent (for sync). This issue affects customers who are performing Azure AD Connect in-place upgrade to version 1.1.647.0, but currently has Health Agent version 3.0.127.0. After the upgrade, the Health Agent can no longer send health data about Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service to Azure AD Health Service. With this fix, Health Agent version 3.0.129.0 is installed during Azure AD Connect in-place upgrade. Health Agent version 3.0.129.0 does not have compatibility issue with Azure AD Connect version 1.1.649.0.


## 1.1.647.0
Status: October 19 2017

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a known compatibility issue between Azure AD Connect version 1.1.647.0 and Azure AD Connect Health Agent (for sync) version 3.0.127.0. This issue prevents the Health Agent from sending health data about the Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service (including object synchronization errors and run history data) to Azure AD Health Service. Before manually upgrading your Azure AD Connect deployment to version 1.1.647.0, please verify the current version of Azure AD Connect Health Agent installed on your Azure AD Connect server. You can do so by going to *Control Panel → Add Remove Programs* and look for application *Microsoft Azure AD Connect Health Agent for Sync*. If its version is 3.0.127.0, it is recommended that you wait for the next Azure AD Connect version to be available before upgrade. If the Health Agent version isn't 3.0.127.0, it is fine to proceed with the manual, in-place upgrade. Note that this issue does not affect swing upgrade or customers who are performing new installation of Azure AD Connect.

### Azure AD Connect
#### Fixed issues
* Fixed an issue with the *Change user sign-in* task in Azure AD Connect wizard:

  * The issue occurs when you have an existing Azure AD Connect deployment with Password Synchronization **enabled**, and you are trying to set the user sign-in method as *Pass-through Authentication*. Before the change is applied, the wizard incorrectly shows the "*Disable Password Synchronization*" prompt. However, Password Synchronization remains enabled after the change is applied. With this fix, the wizard no longer shows the prompt.

  * By design, the wizard does not disable Password Synchronization when you update the user sign-in method using the *Change user sign-in* task. This is to avoid disruption to customers who want to keep Password Synchronization, even though they are enabling Pass-through Authentication or federation as their primary user sign-in method.
  
  * If you wish to disable Password Synchronization after updating the user sign-in method, you must execute the *Customize Synchronization Configuration* task in the wizard. When you navigate to the *Optional features* page, uncheck the *Password Synchronization* option.
  
  * Note that the same issue also occurs if you try to enable/disable Seamless Single Sign-On. Specifically, you have an existing Azure AD Connect deployment with Password Synchronization enabled and the user sign-in method is already configured as *Pass-through Authentication*. Using the *Change user sign-in* task, you try to check/uncheck the *Enable Seamless Single Sign-On* option while the user sign-in method remains configured as "Pass-through Authentication". Before the change is applied, the wizard incorrectly shows the "*Disable Password Synchronization*" prompt. However, Password Synchronization remains enabled after the change is applied. With this fix, the wizard no longer shows the prompt.

* Fixed an issue with the *Change user sign-in* task in Azure AD Connect wizard:

  * The issue occurs when you have an existing Azure AD Connect deployment with Password Synchronization **disabled**, and you are trying to set the user sign-in method as *Pass-through Authentication*. When the change is applied, the wizard enables both Pass-through Authentication and Password Synchronization. With this fix, the wizard no longer enables Password Synchronization.

  * Previously, Password Synchronization was a pre-requisite for enabling Pass-through Authentication. When you set the user sign-in method as *Pass-through Authentication*, the wizard would enable both Pass-through Authentication and Password Synchronization. Recently, Password Synchronization was removed as a pre-requisite. As part of Azure AD Connect version 1.1.557.0, a change was made to Azure AD Connect to not enable Password Synchronization when you set the user sign-in method as *Pass-through Authentication*. However, the change was only applied to Azure AD Connect installation. With this fix, the same change is also applied to the *Change user sign-in* task.
  
  * Note that the same issue also occurs if you try to enable/disable Seamless Single Sign-On. Specifically, you have an existing Azure AD Connect deployment with Password Synchronization disabled and the user sign-in method is already configured as *Pass-through Authentication*. Using the *Change user sign-in* task, you try to check/uncheck the *Enable Seamless Single Sign-On* option while the user sign-in method remains configured as "Pass-through Authentication". When the change is applied, the wizard enables Password Synchronization. With this fix, the wizard no longer enables Password Synchronization. 

* Fixed an issue that caused Azure AD Connect upgrade to fail with error "*Unable to upgrade the Synchronization Service*". Further, the Synchronization Service can no longer start with event error "*The service was unable to start because the version of the database is newer than the version of the binaries installed*". The issue occurs when the administrator performing the upgrade does not have sysadmin privilege to the SQL server that is being used by Azure AD Connect. With this fix, Azure AD Connect only requires the administrator to have db_owner privilege to the ADSync database during upgrade.

* Fixed an Azure AD Connect Upgrade issue that affected customers who have enabled [Seamless Single Sign-On](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso). After Azure AD Connect is upgraded, Seamless Single Sign-On incorrectly appears as disabled in Azure AD Connect wizard, even though the feature remains enabled and fully functional. With this fix, the feature now appears correctly as enabled in the wizard.

* Fixed an issue that caused Azure AD Connect wizard to always show the “*Configure Source Anchor*” prompt on the *Ready to Configure* page, even if no changes related to Source Anchor were made.

* When performing manual in-place upgrade of Azure AD Connect, the customer is required to provide the Global Administrator credentials of the corresponding Azure AD tenant. Previously, upgrade could proceed even though the Global Administrator's credentials belonged to a different Azure AD tenant. While upgrade appears to complete successfully, certain configurations are not correctly persisted with the upgrade. With this change, the wizard prevents the upgrade from proceeding if the credentials provided do not match the Azure AD tenant.

* Removed redundant logic that unnecessarily restarted Azure AD Connect Health service at the beginning of a manual upgrade.


#### New features and improvements
* Added logic to simplify the steps required to set up Azure AD Connect with Microsoft Germany Cloud. Previously, you are required to update specific registry keys on the Azure AD Connect server for it to work correctly with Microsoft Germany Cloud, as described in this article. Now, Azure AD Connect can automatically detect if your tenant is in Microsoft Germany Cloud based on the global administrator credentials provided during setup.

### Azure AD Connect Sync
> [!NOTE]
> Note: The Synchronization Service has a WMI interface that lets you develop your own custom scheduler. This interface is now deprecated and will be removed from future versions of Azure AD Connect shipped after June 30, 2018. Customers who want to customize synchronization schedule should use the [built-in scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-scheduler).

#### Fixed issues
* When Azure AD Connect wizard creates the AD Connector account required to synchronize changes from on-premises Active Directory, it does not correctly assign the account the permission required to read PublicFolder objects. This issue affects both Express installation and Custom installation. This change fixes the issue.

* Fixed an issue that caused the Azure AD Connect Wizard troubleshooting page to not render correctly for administrators running from Windows Server 2016.

#### New features and improvements
* When troubleshooting Password Synchronization using the Azure AD Connect wizard troubleshooting page, the troubleshooting page now returns domain-specific status.

* Previously, if you tried to enable Password Hash Synchronization, Azure AD Connect does not verify whether the AD Connector account has required permissions to synchronize password hashes from on-premises AD. Now, Azure AD Connect wizard will verify and warn you if the AD Connector account does not have sufficient permissions.

### AD FS Management
#### Fixed issue
* Fixed an issue related to the use of [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-design-concepts#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor) feature. This issue affects customers who have configured *Federation with AD FS* as the user sign-in method. When you execute *Configure Source Anchor* task in the wizard, Azure AD Connect switches to using *ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as source attribute for immutableId. As part of this change, Azure AD Connect attempts to update the claim rules for ImmutableId in AD FS. However, this step failed because Azure AD Connect did not have the administrator credentials required to configure AD FS. With this fix, Azure AD Connect now prompts you to enter the administrator credentials for AD FS when you execute the *Configure Source Anchor* task.



## 1.1.614.0
Status: September 05 2017

### Azure AD Connect

#### Known issues
* There is a known issue that is causing Azure AD Connect upgrade to fail with error "*Unable to upgrade the Synchronization Service*". Further, the Synchronization Service can no longer start with event error "*The service was unable to start because the version of the database is newer than the version of the binaries installed*". The issue occurs when the administrator performing the upgrade does not have sysadmin privilege to the SQL server that is being used by Azure AD Connect. Dbo permissions are not sufficient.

* There is a known issue with Azure AD Connect Upgrade that is affecting customers who have enabled [Seamless Single Sign-On](how-to-connect-sso.md). After Azure AD Connect is upgraded, the feature appears as disabled in the wizard, even though the feature remains enabled. A fix for this issue will be provided in future release. Customers who are concerned about this display issue can manually fix it by enabling Seamless Single Sign-On in the wizard.

#### Fixed issues
* Fixed an issue that prevented Azure AD Connect from updating the claims rules in on-premises AD FS while enabling the [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-design-concepts#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor) feature. The issue occurs if you try to enable the feature for an existing Azure AD Connect deployment that has AD FS configured as the sign-in method. The issue occurs because the wizard does not prompt for ADFS credentials before trying to update the claims rules in AD FS.
* Fixed an issue that caused Azure AD Connect to fail installation if the on-premises AD forest has NTLM disabled. The issue is due to Azure AD Connect wizard not providing fully qualified credentials when creating the security contexts required for Kerberos authentication. This causes Kerberos authentication to fail and Azure AD Connect wizard to fall back to using NTLM.

### Azure AD Connect Sync
#### Fixed issues
* Fixed an issue where new synchronization rule cannot be created if the Tag attribute isn’t populated.
* Fixed an issue that caused Azure AD Connect to connect to on-premises AD for Password Synchronization using NTLM, even though Kerberos is available. This issue occurs if the on-premises AD topology has one or more domain controllers that were restored from a backup.
* Fixed an issue that caused full synchronization steps to occur unnecessarily after upgrade. In general, running full synchronization steps is required after upgrade if there are changes to out-of-box synchronization rules. The issue was due to an error in the change detection logic that incorrectly detected a change when encountering synchronization rule expression with newline characters. Newline characters are inserted into sync rule expression to improve readability.
* Fixed an issue that can cause the Azure AD Connect server to not work correctly after Automatic Upgrade. This issue affects Azure AD Connect servers with version 1.1.443.0 (or earlier). For details about the issue, refer to article [Azure AD Connect is not working correctly after an automatic upgrade](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4038479/azure-ad-connect-is-not-working-correctly-after-an-automatic-upgrade).
* Fixed an issue that can cause Automatic Upgrade to be retried every 5 minutes when errors are encountered. With the fix, Automatic Upgrade retries with exponential back-off when errors are encountered.
* Fixed an issue where password synchronization event 611 is incorrectly shown in Windows Application Event logs as **informational** instead of **error**. Event 611 is generated whenever password synchronization encounters an issue. 
* Fixed an issue in the Azure AD Connect wizard that allows Group writeback feature to be enabled without selecting an OU required for Group writeback.

#### New features and improvements
* Added a Troubleshoot task to Azure AD Connect wizard under Additional Tasks. Customers can leverage this task to troubleshoot issues related to password synchronization and collect general diagnostics. In the future, the Troubleshoot task will be extended to include other directory synchronization-related issues.
* Azure AD Connect now supports a new installation mode called **Use Existing Database**. This installation mode allows customers to install Azure AD Connect that specifies an existing ADSync database. For more information about this feature, refer to article [Use an existing database](how-to-connect-install-existing-database.md).
* For improved security, Azure AD Connect now defaults to using TLS1.2 to connect to Azure AD for directory synchronization. Previously, the default was TLS1.0.
* When Azure AD Connect Password Synchronization Agent starts up, it tries to connect to Azure AD well-known endpoint for password synchronization. Upon successful connection, it is redirected to a region-specific endpoint. Previously, the Password Synchronization Agent caches the region-specific endpoint until it is restarted. Now, the agent clears the cache and retries with the well-known endpoint if it encounters connection issue with the region-specific endpoint. This change ensures that password synchronization can failover to a different region-specific endpoint when the cached region-specific endpoint is no longer available.
* To synchronize changes from an on-premises AD forest, an AD DS account is required. You can either (i) create the AD DS account yourself and provide its credential to Azure AD Connect, or (ii) provide an Enterprise Admin's credentials and let Azure AD Connect create the AD DS account for you. Previously, (i) is the default option in the Azure AD Connect wizard. Now, (ii) is the default option.

### Azure AD Connect Health

#### New features and improvements
* Added support for Microsoft Azure Government Cloud and Microsoft Cloud Germany.

### AD FS Management
#### Fixed issues
* The Initialize-ADSyncNGCKeysWriteBack cmdlet in the AD prep powershell module was incorrectly applying ACLs to the device registration container and would therefore only inherit existing permissions.  This was updated so that the sync service account has the correct permissions.

#### New features and improvements
* The AAD Connect Verify ADFS Login task was updated so that it verifies logins against Microsoft Online and not just token retrieval from ADFS.
* When setting up a new ADFS farm using AAD Connect, the page asking for ADFS credentials was moved so that it now occurs before the user is asked to provide ADFS and WAP servers.  This allows AAD Connect to check that the account specified has the correct permissions.
* During AAD Connect upgrade, we will no longer fail an upgrade if the ADFS AAD Trust fails to update.  If that happens, the user will be shown an appropriate warning message and should proceed to reset the trust via the AAD Connect additional task.

### Seamless Single Sign-On
#### Fixed issues
* Fixed an issue that caused Azure AD Connect wizard to return an error if you try to enable [Seamless Single Sign-On](how-to-connect-sso.md). The error message is *“Configuration of Microsoft Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent failed.”* This issue affects existing customers who had manually upgraded the preview version of the Authentication Agents for [Pass-through Authentication](how-to-connect-sso.md) based on the steps described in this [article](how-to-connect-pta-upgrade-preview-authentication-agents.md).


## 1.1.561.0
Status: July 23 2017

### Azure AD Connect

#### Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue that caused the out-of-box synchronization rule “Out to AD - User ImmutableId” to be removed:

  * The issue occurs when Azure AD Connect is upgraded, or when the task option *Update Synchronization Configuration* in the Azure AD Connect wizard is used to update Azure AD Connect synchronization configuration.
  
  * This synchronization rule is applicable to customers who have enabled the [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor feature](plan-connect-design-concepts.md#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor). This feature was introduced in version 1.1.524.0 and after. When the synchronization rule is removed, Azure AD Connect can no longer populate on-premises AD ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid attribute with the ObjectGuid attribute value. It does not prevent new users from being provisioned into Azure AD.
  
  * The fix ensures that the synchronization rule will no longer be removed during upgrade, or during configuration change, as long as the feature is enabled. For existing customers who have been affected by this issue, the fix also ensures that the synchronization rule is added back after upgrading to this version of Azure AD Connect.

* Fixed an issue that causes out-of-box synchronization rules to have precedence value that is less than 100:

  * In general, precedence values 0 - 99 are reserved for custom synchronization rules. During upgrade, the precedence values for out-of-box synchronization rules are updated to accommodate sync rule changes. Due to this issue, out-of-box synchronization rules may be assigned precedence value that is less than 100.
  
  * The fix prevents the issue from occurring during upgrade. However, it does not restore the precedence values for existing customers who have been affected by the issue. A separate fix will be provided in the future to help with the restoration.

* Fixed an issue where the [Domain and OU Filtering screen](how-to-connect-install-custom.md#domain-and-ou-filtering) in the Azure AD Connect wizard is showing *Sync all domains and OUs* option as selected, even though OU-based filtering is enabled.

*	Fixed an issue that caused the [Configure Directory Partitions screen](how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering.md#organizational-unitbased-filtering) in the Synchronization Service Manager to return an error if the *Refresh* button is clicked. The error message is *“An error was encountered while refreshing domains: Unable to cast object of type ‘System.Collections.ArrayList’ to type ‘Microsoft.DirectoryServices.MetadirectoryServices.UI.PropertySheetBase.MaPropertyPages.PartitionObject.”* The error occurs when new AD domain has been added to an existing AD forest and you are trying to update Azure AD Connect using the Refresh button.

#### New features and improvements

* [Automatic Upgrade feature](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md) has been expanded to support customers with the following configurations:
  * You have enabled the device writeback feature.
  * You have enabled the group writeback feature.
  * The installation is not an Express settings or a DirSync upgrade.
  * You have more than 100,000 objects in the metaverse.
  * You are connecting to more than one forest. Express setup only connects to one forest.
  * The AD Connector account is not the default MSOL_ account anymore.
  * The server is set to be in staging mode.
  * You have enabled the user writeback feature.
  
  >[!NOTE]
  >The scope expansion of the Automatic Upgrade feature affects customers with Azure AD Connect build 1.1.105.0 and after. If you do not want your Azure AD Connect server to be automatically upgraded, you must run following cmdlet on your Azure AD Connect server: `Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade -AutoUpgradeState disabled`. For more information about enabling/disabling Automatic Upgrade, refer to article [Azure AD Connect: Automatic upgrade](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md).

## 1.1.558.0
Status: Will not be released. Changes in this build are included in version 1.1.561.0.

### Azure AD Connect

#### Fixed issue

* Fixed an issue that caused the out-of-box synchronization rule “Out to AD - User ImmutableId” to be removed when OU-based filtering configuration is updated. This synchronization rule is required for the [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor feature](plan-connect-design-concepts.md#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor).

* Fixed an issue where the [Domain and OU Filtering screen](how-to-connect-install-custom.md#domain-and-ou-filtering) in the Azure AD Connect wizard is showing *Sync all domains and OUs* option as selected, even though OU-based filtering is enabled.

*	Fixed an issue that caused the [Configure Directory Partitions screen](how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering.md#organizational-unitbased-filtering) in the Synchronization Service Manager to return an error if the *Refresh* button is clicked.

## 1.1.557.0
Status: July 2017

>[!NOTE]
>This build is not available to customers through the Azure AD Connect Auto Upgrade feature.

### Azure AD Connect

#### Fixed issue
* Fixed an issue with the Initialize-ADSyncDomainJoinedComputerSync cmdlet that caused the verified domain configured on the existing service connection point object to be changed even if it is still a valid domain. This issue occurs when your Azure AD tenant has more than one verified domains that can be used for configuring the service connection point.

#### New features and improvements
* Password writeback is now available for preview with Microsoft Azure Government cloud and Microsoft Cloud Germany. For more information about Azure AD Connect support for the different service instances, refer to article [Azure AD Connect: Special considerations for instances](reference-connect-instances.md).

* The Initialize-ADSyncDomainJoinedComputerSync cmdlet now has a new optional parameter named AzureADDomain. This parameter lets you specify which verified domain to be used for configuring the service connection point.

### Pass-through Authentication

#### New features and improvements
* The name of the agent required for Pass-through Authentication has been changed from *Microsoft Azure AD Application Proxy Connector* to *Microsoft Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent*.

* Enabling Pass-through Authentication no longer enables Password Hash Synchronization by default.


## 1.1.553.0
Status: June 2017

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are schema and sync rule changes introduced in this build. Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service will trigger Full Import and Full Synchronization steps after upgrade. Details of the changes are described below. To temporarily defer Full Import and Full Synchronization steps after upgrade, refer to article [How to defer full synchronization after upgrade](how-to-upgrade-previous-version.md#how-to-defer-full-synchronization-after-upgrade).
>
>

### Azure AD Connect Sync

#### Known issue
* There is an issue that affects customers who are using [OU-based filtering](how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering.md#organizational-unitbased-filtering) with Azure AD Connect sync. When you navigate to the [Domain and OU Filtering page](how-to-connect-install-custom.md#domain-and-ou-filtering) in the Azure AD Connect wizard, the following behavior is expected:
  * If OU-based filtering is enabled, the **Sync selected domains and OUs** option is selected.
  * Otherwise, the **Sync all domains and OUs** option is selected.

The issue that arises is that the **Sync all domains and OUs option** is always selected when you run the Wizard.  This occurs even if OU-based filtering was previously configured. Before saving any AAD Connect configuration changes, make sure the **Sync selected domains and OUs option is selected** and confirm that all OUs that need to synchronize are enabled again. Otherwise, OU-based filtering will be disabled.

#### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue with Password writeback that allows an Azure AD Administrator to reset the password of an on-premises AD privileged user account. The issue occurs when Azure AD Connect is granted the Reset Password permission over the privileged account. The issue is addressed in this version of Azure AD Connect by not allowing an Azure AD Administrator to reset the password of an arbitrary on-premises AD privileged user account unless the administrator is the owner of that account. For more information, refer to [Security Advisory 4033453](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/4033453).

* Fixed an issue related to the [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-design-concepts#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor) feature where Azure AD Connect does not writeback to on-premises AD ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid attribute. The issue occurs when there are multiple on-premises AD forests added to Azure AD Connect and the *User identities exist across multiple directories option* is selected. When such configuration is used, the resultant synchronization rules do not populate the sourceAnchorBinary attribute in the Metaverse. The sourceAnchorBinary attribute is used as the source attribute for ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid attribute. As a result, writeback to the ms-DSConsistencyGuid attribute does not occur. To fix the issue, following sync rules have been updated to ensure that the sourceAnchorBinary attribute in the Metaverse is always populated:
  * In from AD - InetOrgPerson AccountEnabled.xml
  * In from AD - InetOrgPerson Common.xml
  * In from AD - User AccountEnabled.xml
  * In from AD - User Common.xml
  * In from AD - User Join SOAInAAD.xml

* Previously, even if the [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-design-concepts#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor) feature isn’t enabled, the “Out to AD – User ImmutableId” synchronization rule is still added to Azure AD Connect. The effect is benign and does not cause writeback of ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid attribute to occur. To avoid confusion, logic has been added to ensure that the sync rule is only added when the feature is enabled.

* Fixed an issue that caused password hash synchronization to fail with error event 611. This issue occurs after one or more domain controllers have been removed from on-premises AD. At the end of each password synchronization cycle, the synchronization cookie issued by on-premises AD contains Invocation IDs of the removed domain controllers with USN (Update Sequence Number) value of 0. The Password Synchronization Manager is unable to persist synchronization cookie containing USN value of 0 and fails with error event 611. During the next synchronization cycle, the Password Synchronization Manager reuses the last persisted synchronization cookie that does not contain USN value of 0. This causes the same password changes to be resynchronized. With this fix, the Password Synchronization Manager persists the synchronization cookie correctly.

* Previously, even if Automatic Upgrade has been disabled using the Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade cmdlet, the Automatic Upgrade process continues to check for upgrade periodically, and relies on the downloaded installer to honor disablement. With this fix, the Automatic Upgrade process no longer checks for upgrade periodically. The fix is automatically applied when upgrade installer for this Azure AD Connect version is executed once.

#### New features and improvements

* Previously, the [ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as Source Anchor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-design-concepts#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor) feature was available to new deployments only. Now, it is available to existing deployments. More specifically:
  * To access the feature, start the Azure AD Connect wizard and choose the *Update Source Anchor* option.
  * This option is only visible to existing deployments that are using objectGuid as sourceAnchor attribute.
  * When configuring the option, the wizard validates the state of the ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid attribute in your on-premises Active Directory. If the attribute isn't configured on any user object in the directory, the wizard uses the ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as the sourceAnchor attribute. If the attribute is configured on one or more user objects in the directory, the wizard concludes the attribute is being used by other applications and is not suitable as sourceAnchor attribute and does not permit the Source Anchor change to proceed. If you are certain that the attribute isn't used by existing applications, you need to contact Support for information on how to suppress the error.

* Specific to **userCertificate** attribute on Device objects, Azure AD Connect now looks for certificates values required for [Connecting domain-joined devices to Azure AD for Windows 10 experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-azureadjoin-devices-group-policy) and filters out the rest before synchronizing to Azure AD. To enable this behavior, the out-of-box sync rule “Out to AAD - Device Join SOAInAD” has been updated.

* Azure AD Connect now supports writeback of Exchange Online **cloudPublicDelegates** attribute to on-premises AD **publicDelegates** attribute. This enables the scenario where an Exchange Online mailbox can be granted SendOnBehalfTo rights to users with on-premises Exchange mailbox. To support this feature, a new out-of-box sync rule “Out to AD – User Exchange Hybrid PublicDelegates writeback” has been added. This sync rule is only added to Azure AD Connect when Exchange Hybrid feature is enabled.

* Azure AD Connect now supports synchronizing the **altRecipient** attribute from Azure AD. To support this change, following out-of-box sync rules have been updated to include the required attribute flow:
  * In from AD – User Exchange
  * Out to AAD – User ExchangeOnline
  
* The **cloudSOAExchMailbox** attribute in the Metaverse indicates whether a given user has Exchange Online mailbox or not. Its definition has been updated to include additional Exchange Online RecipientDisplayTypes as such Equipment and Conference Room mailboxes. To enable this change, the definition of the cloudSOAExchMailbox attribute, which is found under out-of-box sync rule “In from AAD – User Exchange Hybrid”, has been updated from:

```
CBool(IIF(IsNullOrEmpty([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]),NULL,BitAnd([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType],&amp;HFF) = 0))
```

... to the following:

```
CBool(
  IIF(IsPresent([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]),(
    IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=0,True,(
      IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=2,True,(
        IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=7,True,(
          IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=8,True,(
            IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=10,True,(
              IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=16,True,(
                IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=17,True,(
                  IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=18,True,(
                    IIF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=1073741824,True,(
                       IF([cloudMSExchRecipientDisplayType]=1073741840,True,False)))))))))))))))))))),False))

```

* Added the following set of X509Certificate2-compatible functions for creating synchronization rule expressions to handle certificate values in the userCertificate attribute:

    ||||
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |CertSubject|CertIssuer|CertKeyAlgorithm|
    |CertSubjectNameDN|CertIssuerOid|CertNameInfo|
    |CertSubjectNameOid|CertIssuerDN|IsCert|
    |CertFriendlyName|CertThumbprint|CertExtensionOids|
    |CertFormat|CertNotAfter|CertPublicKeyOid|
    |CertSerialNumber|CertNotBefore|CertPublicKeyParametersOid|
    |CertVersion|CertSignatureAlgorithmOid|Select|
    |CertKeyAlgorithmParams|CertHashString|Where|
    |||With|

* Following schema changes have been introduced to allow customers to create custom synchronization rules to flow sAMAccountName, domainNetBios, and domainFQDN for Group objects, as well as distinguishedName for User objects:

  * Following attributes have been added to MV schema:
    * Group: AccountName
    * Group: domainNetBios
    * Group: domainFQDN
    * Person: distinguishedName

  * Following attributes have been added to Azure AD Connector schema:
    * Group: OnPremisesSamAccountName
    * Group: NetBiosName
    * Group: DnsDomainName
    * User: OnPremisesDistinguishedName

* The ADSyncDomainJoinedComputerSync cmdlet script now has a new optional parameter named AzureEnvironment. The parameter is used to specify which region the corresponding Azure Active Directory tenant is hosted in. Valid values include:
  * AzureCloud (default)
  * AzureChinaCloud
  * AzureGermanyCloud
  * USGovernment
 
* Updated Sync Rule Editor to use Join (instead of Provision) as the default value of link type during sync rule creation.

### AD FS management

#### Issues fixed

* Following URLs are new WS-Federation endpoints introduced by Azure AD to improve resiliency against authentication outage and will be added to on-premises AD FS replying party trust configuration:
  * https://ests.login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf
  * https://stamp2.login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf
  * https://ccs.login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf
  * https://ccs-sdf.login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf
  
* Fixed an issue that caused AD FS to generate incorrect claim value for IssuerID. The issue occurs if there are multiple verified domains in the Azure AD tenant and the domain suffix of the userPrincipalName attribute used to generate the IssuerID claim is at least 3-levels deep (for example, johndoe@us.contoso.com). The issue is resolved by updating the regex used by the claim rules.

#### New features and improvements
* Previously, the ADFS Certificate Management feature provided by Azure AD Connect can only be used with ADFS farms managed through Azure AD Connect. Now, you can use the feature with ADFS farms that are not managed using Azure AD Connect.

## 1.1.524.0
Released: May 2017

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are schema and sync rule changes introduced in this build. Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service will trigger Full Import and Full Sync steps after upgrade. Details of the changes are described below.
>
>

**Fixed issues:**

Azure AD Connect sync

* Fixed an issue that causes Automatic Upgrade to occur on the Azure AD Connect server even if customer has disabled the feature using the Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade cmdlet. With this fix, the Automatic Upgrade process on the server still checks for upgrade periodically, but the downloaded installer honors the Automatic Upgrade configuration.
* During DirSync in-place upgrade, Azure AD Connect creates an Azure AD service account to be used by the Azure AD connector for synchronizing with Azure AD. After the account is created, Azure AD Connect authenticates with Azure AD using the account. Sometimes, authentication fails because of transient issues, which in turn causes DirSync in-place upgrade to fail with error *“An error has occurred executing Configure AAD Sync task: AADSTS50034: To sign into this application, the account must be added to the xxx.onmicrosoft.com directory.”* To improve the resiliency of DirSync upgrade, Azure AD Connect now retries the authentication step.
* There was an issue with build 443 that causes DirSync in-place upgrade to succeed but run profiles required for directory synchronization are not created. Healing logic is included in this build of Azure AD Connect. When customer upgrades to this build, Azure AD Connect detects missing run profiles and creates them.
* Fixed an issue that causes Password Synchronization process to fail to start with Event ID 6900 and error *“An item with the same key has already been added”*. This issue occurs if you update OU filtering configuration to include AD configuration partition. To fix this issue, Password Synchronization process now synchronizes password changes from AD domain partitions only. Non-domain partitions such as configuration partition are skipped.
* During Express installation, Azure AD Connect creates an on-premises AD DS account to be used by the AD connector to communicate with on-premises AD. Previously, the account is created with the PASSWD_NOTREQD flag set on the user-Account-Control attribute and a random password is set on the account. Now, Azure AD Connect explicitly removes the PASSWD_NOTREQD flag after the password is set on the account.
* Fixed an issue that causes DirSync upgrade to fail with error *“a deadlock occurred in sql server which trying to acquire an application lock”* when the mailNickname attribute is found in the on-premises AD schema, but is not bounded to the AD User object class.
* Fixed an issue that causes Device writeback feature to automatically be disabled when an administrator is updating Azure AD Connect sync configuration using Azure AD Connect wizard. This issue is caused by the wizard performing a pre-requisite check for the existing Device writeback configuration in on-premises AD and the check fails. The fix is to skip the check if Device writeback is already enabled previously.
* To configure OU filtering, you can either use the Azure AD Connect wizard or the Synchronization Service Manager. Previously, if you use the Azure AD Connect wizard to configure OU filtering, new OUs created afterwards are included for directory synchronization. If you do not want new OUs to be included, you must configure OU filtering using the Synchronization Service Manager. Now, you can achieve the same behavior using Azure AD Connect wizard.
* Fixed an issue that causes stored procedures required by Azure AD Connect to be created under the schema of the installing admin, instead of under the dbo schema.
* Fixed an issue that causes the TrackingId attribute returned by Azure AD to be omitted in the AAD Connect Server Event Logs. The issue occurs if Azure AD Connect receives a redirection message from Azure AD and Azure AD Connect is unable to connect to the endpoint provided. The TrackingId is used by Support Engineers to correlate with service side logs during troubleshooting.
* When Azure AD Connect receives LargeObject error from Azure AD, Azure AD Connect generates an event with EventID 6941 and message *“The provisioned object is too large. Trim the number of attribute values on this object.”* At the same time, Azure AD Connect also generates a misleading event with EventID 6900 and message *“Microsoft.Online.Coexistence.ProvisionRetryException: Unable to communicate with the Windows Azure Active Directory service.”* To minimize confusion, Azure AD Connect no longer generates the latter event when LargeObject error is received.
* Fixed an issue that causes the Synchronization Service Manager to become unresponsive when trying to update the configuration for Generic LDAP connector.

**New features/improvements:**

Azure AD Connect sync
* Sync Rule Changes – The following sync rule changes have been implemented:
  * Updated default sync rule set to not export attributes **userCertificate** and **userSMIMECertificate** if the attributes have more than 15 values.
  * AD attributes **employeeID** and **msExchBypassModerationLink** are now included in the default sync rule set.
  * AD attribute **photo** has been removed from default sync rule set.
  * Added **preferredDataLocation** to the Metaverse schema and AAD Connector schema. Customers who want to update either attributes in Azure AD can implement custom sync rules to do so. 
  * Added **userType** to the Metaverse schema and AAD Connector schema. Customers who want to update either attributes in Azure AD can implement custom sync rules to do so.

* Azure AD Connect now automatically enables the use of ConsistencyGuid attribute as the Source Anchor attribute for on-premises AD objects. Further, Azure AD Connect populates the ConsistencyGuid attribute with the objectGuid attribute value if it is empty. This feature is applicable to new deployment only. To find out more about this feature, refer to article section [Azure AD Connect: Design concepts - Using ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as sourceAnchor](plan-connect-design-concepts.md#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor).
* New troubleshooting cmdlet Invoke-ADSyncDiagnostics has been added to help diagnose Password Hash Synchronization related issues. For information about using the cmdlet, refer to article [Troubleshoot password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](tshoot-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md).
* Azure AD Connect now supports synchronizing Mail-Enabled Public Folder objects from on-premises AD to Azure AD. You can enable the feature using Azure AD Connect wizard under Optional Features. To find out more about this feature, refer to article [Office 365 Directory Based Edge Blocking support for on-premises Mail Enabled Public Folders](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2017/05/19/office-365-directory-based-edge-blocking-support-for-on-premises-mail-enabled-public-folders).
* Azure AD Connect requires an AD DS account to synchronize from on-premises AD. Previously, if you installed Azure AD Connect using the Express mode, you could provide the credentials of an Enterprise Admin account and Azure AD Connect would create the AD DS account required. However, for a custom installation and adding forests to an existing deployment, you were required to provide the AD DS account instead. Now, you also have the option to provide the credentials of an Enterprise Admin account during a custom installation and let Azure AD Connect create the AD DS account required.
* Azure AD Connect now supports SQL AOA. You must enable SQL AOA before installing Azure AD Connect. During installation, Azure AD Connect detects whether the SQL instance provided is enabled for SQL AOA or not. If SQL AOA is enabled, Azure AD Connect further figures out if SQL AOA is configured to use synchronous replication or asynchronous replication. When setting up the Availability Group Listener, it is recommended that you set the RegisterAllProvidersIP property to 0. This recommendation is because Azure AD Connect currently uses SQL Native Client to connect to SQL and SQL Native Client does not support the use of MultiSubNetFailover property.
* If you are using LocalDB as the database for your Azure AD Connect server and has reached its 10-GB size limit, the Synchronization Service no longer starts. Previously, you need to perform ShrinkDatabase operation on the LocalDB to reclaim enough DB space for the Synchronization Service to start. After which, you can use the Synchronization Service Manager to delete run history to reclaim more DB space. Now, you can use Start-ADSyncPurgeRunHistory cmdlet to purge run history data from LocalDB to reclaim DB space. Further, this cmdlet supports an offline mode (by specifying the -offline parameter) which can be used when the Synchronization Service is not running. Note: The offline mode can only be used if the Synchronization Service is not running and the database used is LocalDB.
* To reduce the amount of storage space required, Azure AD Connect now compresses sync error details before storing them in LocalDB/SQL databases. When upgrading from an older version of Azure AD Connect to this version, Azure AD Connect performs a one-time compression on existing sync error details.
* Previously, after updating OU filtering configuration, you must manually run Full import to ensure existing objects are properly included/excluded from directory synchronization. Now, Azure AD Connect automatically triggers Full import during the next sync cycle. Further, Full import is only be applied to the AD connectors affected by the update. Note: this improvement is applicable to OU filtering updates made using the Azure AD Connect wizard only. It is not applicable to OU filtering update made using the Synchronization Service Manager.
* Previously, Group-based filtering supports Users, Groups, and Contact objects only. Now, Group-based filtering also supports Computer objects.
* Previously, you can delete Connector Space data without disabling Azure AD Connect sync scheduler. Now, the Synchronization Service Manager blocks the deletion of Connector Space data if it detects that the scheduler is enabled. Further, a warning is returned to inform customers about potential data loss if the Connector space data is deleted.
* Previously, you must disable PowerShell transcription for Azure AD Connect wizard to run correctly. This issue is partially resolved. You can enable PowerShell transcription if you are using Azure AD Connect wizard to manage sync configuration. You must disable PowerShell transcription if you are using Azure AD Connect wizard to manage ADFS configuration.



## 1.1.486.0
Released: April 2017

**Fixed issues:**
* Fixed the issue where Azure AD Connect will not install successfully on localized version of Windows Server.

## 1.1.484.0
Released: April 2017

**Known issues:**

* This version of Azure AD Connect will not install successfully if the following conditions are all true:
   1. You are performing either DirSync in-place upgrade or fresh installation of Azure AD Connect.
   2. You are using a localized version of Windows Server where the name of built-in Administrator group on the server isn't "Administrators".
   3. You are using the default SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB installed with Azure AD Connect instead of providing your own full SQL.

**Fixed issues:**

Azure AD Connect sync
* Fixed an issue where the sync scheduler skips the entire sync step if one or more connectors are missing run profile for that sync step. For example, you manually added a connector using the Synchronization Service Manager without creating a Delta Import run profile for it. This fix ensures that the sync scheduler continues to run Delta Import for other connectors.
* Fixed an issue where the Synchronization Service immediately stops processing a run profile when it is encounters an issue with one of the run steps. This fix ensures that the Synchronization Service skips that run step and continues to process the rest. For example, you have a Delta Import run profile for your AD connector with multiple run steps (one for each on-premises AD domain). The Synchronization Service will run Delta Import with the other AD domains even if one of them has network connectivity issues.
* Fixed an issue that causes the Azure AD Connector update to be skipped during Automatic Upgrade.
* Fixed an issue that causes Azure AD Connect to incorrectly determine whether the server is a domain controller during setup, which in turn causes DirSync upgrade to fail.
* Fixed an issue that causes DirSync in-place upgrade to not create any run profile for the Azure AD Connector.
* Fixed an issue where the Synchronization Service Manager user interface becomes unresponsive when trying to configure Generic LDAP Connector.

AD FS management
* Fixed an issue where the Azure AD Connect wizard fails if the AD FS primary node has been moved to another server.

Desktop SSO
* Fixed an issue in the Azure AD Connect wizard where the Sign-In screen does not let you enable Desktop SSO feature if you chose Password Synchronization as your Sign-In option during new installation.

**New features/improvements:**

Azure AD Connect sync
* Azure AD Connect Sync now supports the use of Virtual Service Account, Managed Service Account and Group Managed Service Account as its service account. This applies to new installation of Azure AD Connect only. When installing Azure AD Connect:
    * By default, Azure AD Connect wizard will create a Virtual Service Account and uses it as its service account.
    * If you are installing on a domain controller, Azure AD Connect falls back to previous behavior where it will create a domain user account and uses it as its service account instead.
    * You can override the default behavior by providing one of the following:
      * A Group Managed Service Account
      * A Managed Service Account
      * A domain user account
      * A local user account
* Previously, if you upgrade to a new build of Azure AD Connect containing connectors update or sync rule changes, Azure AD Connect will trigger a full sync cycle. Now, Azure AD Connect selectively triggers Full Import step only for connectors with update, and Full Synchronization step only for connectors with sync rule changes.
* Previously, the Export Deletion Threshold only applies to exports which are triggered through the sync scheduler. Now, the feature is extended to include exports manually triggered by the customer using the Synchronization Service Manager.
* On your Azure AD tenant, there is a service configuration which indicates whether Password Synchronization feature is enabled for your tenant or not. Previously, it is easy for the service configuration to be incorrectly configured by Azure AD Connect when you have an active and a staging server. Now, Azure AD Connect will attempt to keep the service configuration consistent with your active Azure AD Connect server only.
* Azure AD Connect wizard now detects and returns a warning if on-premises AD does not have AD Recycle Bin enabled.
* Previously, Export to Azure AD times out and fails if the combined size of the objects in the batch exceeds certain threshold. Now, the Synchronization Service will reattempt to resend the objects in separate, smaller batches if the issue is encountered.
* The Synchronization Service Key Management application has been removed from Windows Start Menu. Management of encryption key will continue to be supported through command-line interface using miiskmu.exe. For information about managing encryption key, refer to article [Abandoning the Azure AD Connect Sync encryption key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-change-serviceacct-pass#abandoning-the-adsync-service-account-encryption-key).
* Previously, if you change the Azure AD Connect sync service account password, the Synchronization Service will not be able start correctly until you have abandoned the encryption key and reinitialized the Azure AD Connect sync service account password. Now, this process is no longer required.

Desktop SSO

* Azure AD Connect wizard no longer requires port 9090 to be opened on the network when configuring Pass-through Authentication and Desktop SSO. Only port 443 is required. 

## 1.1.443.0
Released: March 2017

**Fixed issues:**

Azure AD Connect sync
* Fixed an issue which causes Azure AD Connect wizard to fail if the display name of the Azure AD Connector does not contain the initial onmicrosoft.com domain assigned to the Azure AD tenant.
* Fixed an issue which causes Azure AD Connect wizard to fail while making connection to SQL database when the password of the Sync Service Account contains special characters such as apostrophe, colon and space.
* Fixed an issue which causes the error “The image has an anchor that is different than the image” to occur on an Azure AD Connect server in staging mode, after you have temporarily excluded an on-premises AD object from syncing and then included it again for syncing.
* Fixed an issue which causes the error “The object located by DN is a phantom” to occur on an Azure AD Connect server in staging mode, after you have temporarily excluded an on-premises AD object from syncing and then included it again for syncing.

AD FS management
* Fixed an issue where Azure AD Connect wizard does not update AD FS configuration and set the right claims on the relying party trust after Alternate Login ID is configured.
* Fixed an issue where Azure AD Connect wizard is unable to correctly handle AD FS servers whose service accounts are configured using userPrincipalName format instead of sAMAccountName format.

Pass-through Authentication
* Fixed an issue which causes Azure AD Connect wizard to fail if Pass Through Authentication is selected but registration of its connector fails.
* Fixed an issue which causes Azure AD Connect wizard to bypass validation checks on sign-in method selected when Desktop SSO feature is enabled.

Password Reset
* Fixed an issue which may cause the Azure AAD Connect server to not attempt to re-connect if the connection was killed by a firewall or proxy.

**New features/improvements:**

Azure AD Connect sync
* Get-ADSyncScheduler cmdlet now returns a new Boolean property named SyncCycleInProgress. If the returned value is true, it means that there is a scheduled synchronization cycle in progress.
* Destination folder for storing Azure AD Connect installation and setup logs has been moved from %localappdata%\AADConnect to %programdata%\AADConnect to improve accessibility to the log files.

AD FS management
* Added support for updating AD FS Farm SSL Certificate.
* Added support for managing AD FS 2016.
* You can now specify existing gMSA (Group Managed Service Account) during AD FS installation.
* You can now configure SHA-256 as the signature hash algorithm for Azure AD relying party trust.

Password Reset
* Introduced improvements to allow the product to function in environments with more stringent firewall rules.
* Improved connection reliability to Azure Service Bus.

## 1.1.380.0
Released: December 2016

**Fixed issue:**

* Fixed the issue where the issuerid claim rule for Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is missing in this build.

>[!NOTE]
>This build is not available to customers through the Azure AD Connect Auto Upgrade feature.

## 1.1.371.0
Released: December 2016

**Known issue:**

* The issuerid claim rule for AD FS is missing in this build. The issuerid claim rule is required if you are federating multiple domains with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). If you are using Azure AD Connect to manage your on-premises AD FS deployment, upgrading to this build removes the existing issuerid claim rule from your AD FS configuration. You can work around the issue by adding the issuerid claim rule after the installation/upgrade. For details on adding the issuerid claim rule, refer to this article on [Multiple domain support for federating with Azure AD](how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains.md).

**Fixed issue:**

* If Port 9090 is not opened for the outbound connection, the Azure AD Connect installation or upgrade fails.

>[!NOTE]
>This build is not available to customers through the Azure AD Connect Auto Upgrade feature.

## 1.1.370.0
Released: December 2016

**Known issues:**

* The issuerid claim rule for AD FS is missing in this build. The issuerid claim rule is required if you are federating multiple domains with Azure AD. If you are using Azure AD Connect to manage your on-premises AD FS deployment, upgrading to this build removes the existing issuerid claim rule from your AD FS configuration. You can work around the issue by adding the issuerid claim rule after installation/upgrade. For details on adding issuerid claim rule, refer to this article on [Multiple domain support for federating with Azure AD](how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains.md).
* Port 9090 must be open outbound to complete installation.

**New features:**

* Pass-through Authentication (Preview).

>[!NOTE]
>This build is not available to customers through the Azure AD Connect Auto Upgrade feature.

## 1.1.343.0
Released: November 2016

**Known issue:**

* The issuerid claim rule for AD FS is missing in this build. The issuerid claim rule is required if you are federating multiple domains with Azure AD. If you are using Azure AD Connect to manage your on-premises AD FS deployment, upgrading to this build removes the existing issuerid claim rule from your AD FS configuration. You can work around the issue by adding the issuerid claim rule after installation/upgrade. For details on adding issuerid claim rule, refer to this article on [Multiple domain support for federating with Azure AD](how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains.md).

**Fixed issues:**

* Sometimes, installing Azure AD Connect fails because it is unable to create a local service account whose password meets the level of complexity specified by the organization's password policy.
* Fixed an issue where join rules are not reevaluated when an object in the connector space simultaneously becomes out-of-scope for one join rule and become in-scope for another. This can happen if you have two or more join rules whose join conditions are mutually exclusive.
* Fixed an issue where inbound synchronization rules (from Azure AD), which do not contain join rules, are not processed if they have lower precedence values than those containing join rules.

**Improvements:**

* Added support for installing Azure AD Connect on Windows Server 2016 Standard or higher.
* Added support for using SQL Server 2016 as the remote database for Azure AD Connect.

## 1.1.281.0
Released: August 2016

**Fixed issues:**

* Changes to sync interval do not take place until after the next sync cycle is complete.
* Azure AD Connect wizard does not accept an Azure AD account whose username starts with an underscore (\_).
* Azure AD Connect wizard fails to authenticate the Azure AD account if the account password contains too many special characters. Error message "Unable to validate credentials. An unexpected error has occurred." is returned.
* Uninstalling staging server disables password synchronization in Azure AD tenant and causes password synchronization to fail with active server.
* Password synchronization fails in uncommon cases when there is no password hash stored on the user.
* When Azure AD Connect server is enabled for staging mode, password writeback is not temporarily disabled.
* Azure AD Connect wizard does not show the actual password synchronization and password writeback configuration when server is in staging mode. It always shows them as disabled.
* Configuration changes to password synchronization and password writeback are not persisted by Azure AD Connect wizard when server is in staging mode.

**Improvements:**

* Updated the Start-ADSyncSyncCycle cmdlet to indicate whether it is able to successfully start a new sync cycle or not.
* Added the Stop-ADSyncSyncCycle cmdlet to terminate sync cycle and operation, which are currently in progress.
* Updated the Stop-ADSyncScheduler cmdlet to terminate sync cycle and operation, which are currently in progress.
* When configuring [Directory extensions](how-to-connect-sync-feature-directory-extensions.md) in Azure AD Connect wizard, the Azure AD attribute of type "Teletex string" can now be selected.

## 1.1.189.0
Released: June 2016

**Fixed issues and improvements:**

* Azure AD Connect can now be installed on a FIPS-compliant server.
  * For password synchronization, see [Password hash sync and FIPS](how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md#password-hash-synchronization-and-fips).

* Added support for [Microsoft Cloud Germany](reference-connect-instances.md#microsoft-cloud-germany).
* Added support for the latest [Microsoft Azure Government cloud](reference-connect-instances.md#microsoft-azure-government) infrastructure with new URL requirements.

**Fixed issues and improvements:**

* Added filtering to the Sync Rule Editor to make it easy to find sync rules.
* Improved performance when deleting a connector space.
* Fixed an issue when the same object was both deleted and added in the same run (called delete/add).
* A disabled sync rule no longer re-enables included objects and attributes on upgrade or directory schema refresh.

## 1.1.130.0
Released: April 2016

**New features:**

* Added support for multi-valued attributes to [Directory extensions](how-to-connect-sync-feature-directory-extensions.md).
* Added support for more configuration variations for [automatic upgrade](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md) to be considered eligible for upgrade.
* Added some cmdlets for [custom scheduler](how-to-connect-sync-feature-scheduler.md#custom-scheduler).

## 1.1.119.0
Released: March 2016

**Fixed issues:**

* Made sure Express installation cannot be used on Windows Server 2008 (pre-R2) because password sync is not supported on this operating system.
* Upgrade from DirSync with a custom filter configuration did not work as expected.
* When upgrading to a newer release and there are no changes to the configuration, a full import/synchronization should not be scheduled.

## 1.1.110.0
Released: February 2016

**Fixed issues:**

* Upgrade from earlier releases does not work if the installation is not in the default C:\Program Files folder.
* If you install and clear **Start the synchronization process** at the end of the installation wizard, running the installation wizard a second time will not enable the scheduler.
* The scheduler doesn't work as expected on servers where the US-en date/time format is not used. It will also block `Get-ADSyncScheduler` to return correct times.
* If you installed an earlier release of Azure AD Connect with AD FS as the sign-in option and upgrade, you cannot run the installation wizard again.

## 1.1.105.0
Released: February 2016

**New features:**

* [Automatic upgrade](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md) feature for Express settings customers.
* Support for the global admin by using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and Privileged Identity Management in the installation wizard.
  * You need to allow your proxy to also allow traffic to https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com if you use Multi-Factor Authentication.
  * You need to add https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com to your trusted sites list for Multi-Factor Authentication to properly work.
* Allow changing the user's sign-in method after initial installation.
* Allow [Domain and OU filtering](how-to-connect-install-custom.md#domain-and-ou-filtering) in the installation wizard. This also allows connecting to forests where not all domains are available.
* [Scheduler](how-to-connect-sync-feature-scheduler.md) is built in to the sync engine.

**Features promoted from preview to GA:**

* [Device writeback](how-to-connect-device-writeback.md).
* [Directory extensions](how-to-connect-sync-feature-directory-extensions.md).

Released: December 2015

**Fixed issues:**

* Password sync might not work when you change passwords in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), but works when you do set a password.
* When you have a proxy server, authentication to Azure AD might fail during installation, or if an upgrade is canceled on the configuration page.

Released: August 2015

**New features:**

* The Azure AD Connect installation wizard is now localized to all Windows Server languages.
* Added support for account unlock when using Azure AD password management.

**Fixed issues:**

* Azure AD Connect installation wizard crashes if another user continues installation rather than the person who first started the installation.

* Azure AD Connect sometimes fails to install on a domain controller.
* Cannot enable and disable “Staging mode” if extension attributes have been added.

* DirSync cannot be upgraded if a distinguished name (DN) is used in attribute filtering.
* Excessive CPU usage when using password reset.

**Removed preview features:**

* The preview feature [User writeback](how-to-connect-preview.md#user-writeback) was temporarily removed based on feedback from our preview customers. It will be added again later after we have addressed the provided feedback.

## 1.0.494.0501
Released: May 2015

**New Requirement:**

* Azure AD Sync now requires the .NET Framework version 4.5.1 to be installed.

**Fixed issues:**

* Password writeback from Azure AD is failing with an Azure Service Bus connectivity error.

## 1.0.491.0413
Released: April 2015

**Fixed issues and improvements:**

* The Active Directory Connector does not process deletes correctly if the recycle bin is enabled and there are multiple domains in the forest.
* The performance of import operations has been improved for the Azure Active Directory Connector.
* When a group has exceeded the membership limit (by default, the limit is set to 50,000 objects), the group was deleted in Azure Active Directory. With the new behavior, the group is not deleted, an error is thrown, and new membership changes are not exported.
* A new object cannot be provisioned if a staged delete with the same DN is already present in the connector space.
* Some objects are marked for synchronization during a delta sync even though there's no change staged on the object.
* Forcing a password sync also removes the preferred DC list.
* CSExportAnalyzer has problems with some objects states.

**New features:**

* A join can now connect to “ANY” object type in the MV.

## 1.0.485.0222
Released: February 2015

**Improvements:**

* Improved import performance.

**Fixed issues:**

* Password Sync honors the cloudFiltered attribute that is used by attribute filtering. Filtered objects are no longer in scope for password synchronization.
* In rare situations where the topology had many domain controllers, password sync doesn’t work.
* “Stopped-server” when importing from the Azure AD Connector after device management has been enabled in Azure AD/Intune.
* Joining Foreign Security Principals (FSPs) from multiple domains in same forest causes an ambiguous-join error.

## 1.0.475.1202
Released: December 2014

**New features:**

* Password synchronization with attribute-based filtering is now supported. For more information, see [Password synchronization with filtering](how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering.md).
* The ms-DS-ExternalDirectoryObjectID attribute is written back to Active Directory. This feature adds support for Office 365 applications. It uses OAuth2 to access online and on-premises mailboxes in a Hybrid Exchange Deployment.

**Fixed upgrade issues:**

* A newer version of the sign-in assistant is available on the server.
* A custom installation path was used to install Azure AD Sync.
* An invalid custom join criterion blocks the upgrade.

* Fixed ETW tracing for password synchronization.

## 1.0.470.1023
Released: October 2014

**New features:**

* Password synchronization from multiple on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD.
* Localized installation UI to all Windows Server languages.

**Upgrading from AADSync 1.0 GA**

If you already have Azure AD Sync installed, there is one additional step you have to take in case you have changed any of the out-of-box synchronization rules. After you have upgraded to the 1.0.470.1023 release, the synchronization rules you have modified are duplicated. For each modified sync rule, do the following:

1. Locate the sync rule you have modified and take a note of the changes.
1. Delete the sync rule.
1. Locate the new sync rule that is created by Azure AD Sync and then reapply the changes.

**Permissions for the Active Directory account**

The Active Directory account must be granted additional permissions to be able to read the password hashes from Active Directory. The permissions to grant are named “Replicating Directory Changes” and “Replicating Directory Changes All.” Both permissions are required to be able to read the password hashes.

## 1.0.419.0911
Released: September 2014

**Initial release of Azure AD Sync.**
