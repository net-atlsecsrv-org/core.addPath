# Azure AD federation compatibility list
Azure Active Directory provides single-sign on and enhanced application access security for Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft Online services for hybrid and cloud-only implementations without requiring any third-party solution. Microsoft 365, like most of Microsoftâ€™s Online services, is integrated with Azure Active Directory for directory services, authentication, and authorization. Azure Active Directory also provides single sign-on to thousands of SaaS applications and on-premises web applications. See the Azure Active Directory [application gallery](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/azure-active-directory-apps) for supported SaaS applications. 

## IDP Validation
If your organization uses a third-party federation solution, you can configure single sign-on for your on-premises Active Directory users with Microsoft Online services, such as Microsoft 365, provided the third-party federation solution is compatible with Azure Active Directory.  For questions regarding compatibility, please contact your identity provider.  If you would like to see a list of identity providers who have previously been tested for compatibility with Azure AD, by Microsoft, see [Azure AD identity provider compatibility docs](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56843). 

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft no longer provides validation testing to independent identity providers for compatibility with Azure Active Directory. If you would like to test your product for interoperability please refer to these [guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56843).
