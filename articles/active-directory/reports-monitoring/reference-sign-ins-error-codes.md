# Sign-in activity report error codes 

With the information provided by the [user sign-ins report](concept-sign-ins.md), you find answers to questions such as:

- Who signed in to my application?
- Which applications were signed in to?
- Which sign-ins failed and why?

When a sign-in fails, you see an error code corresponding to the failure. [Find the description for an error code](https://login.microsoftonline.com/error).
