# Sign-in activity report error codes 

With the information provided by the [user sign-ins report](concept-sign-ins.md), you find answers to questions such as:

- Who signed in to my application?
- Which applications were signed in to?
- Which sign-ins failed and why?

When a sign-in fails, you will see an error code corresponding to the failure. This article lists the error codes and their descriptions, along with a suggested course of action where applicable. 

## How can I display failed sign-ins? 

Navigate to the [Sign-ins report](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

![Sign-in activity](./media/reference-sign-ins-error-codes/61.png "Sign-in activity")

Filter the report to display all failed sign-ins by selecting **Failure** from the **Sign-in status** drop-down box.

![Sign-in activity](./media/reference-sign-ins-error-codes/06.png "Sign-in activity")

Selecting an item from the filtered list opens the **Activity Details: Sign-ins** blade. This view provides you with additional information about the failed sign-in event, including the **sign-in error code** and **failure reason**.

![Sign-in activity](./media/reference-sign-ins-error-codes/05.png "Sign-in activity")

You can also programmatically access the sign-in data using the [reporting API](concept-reporting-api.md).
