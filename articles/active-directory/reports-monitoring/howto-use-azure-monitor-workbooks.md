# How to use Azure Monitor workbooks for Azure Active Directory reports

Do you want to:

- Understand the effect of your [Conditional Access policies](../conditional-access/overview.md) on your users' sign-in experience?

- Troubleshoot sign-in failures to get a better view of your organization's sign-in health and to resolve issues quickly?

- Know who's using legacy authentications to sign in to your environment? (By [blocking legacy authentication](../conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication.md), you can improve your tenant's protection.)

To help you to address these questions, Active Directory provides workbooks for monitoring. [Azure Monitor workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-workbooks) combine text,â€¯analytics queries, metrics, and parameters into rich interactive reports. 

This article:

- Assumes you're familiar with how to [Create interactive reports by using Monitor workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-workbooks).

- Explains how to use Monitor workbooks to understand the effect of your Conditional Access policies, to troubleshoot sign-in failures, and to identify legacy authentications.
