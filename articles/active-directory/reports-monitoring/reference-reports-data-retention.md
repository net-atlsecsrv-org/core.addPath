# How long does Azure AD store reporting data?


In this article, you learn about the data retention policies for the different activity reports in Azure Active Directory. 

### When does Azure AD start collecting data?

| Azure AD Edition | Collection Start |
| :--              | :--   |
| Azure AD Premium P1 <br /> Azure AD Premium P2 | When you sign up for a subscription |
| Azure AD Free| The first time you open the [Azure Active Directory blade](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) or use the [reporting APIs](./overview-reports.md)  |

---

### When is the activity data available in the Azure portal?

- **Immediately** - If you have already been working with reports in the Azure portal.
- **Within 2 hours** - If you haven’t turned on reporting in the Azure portal.

### How soon can I see activities data after getting a premium license?

If you already have activities data with your free license, then you can see it immediately on upgrade. If you don’t have any data, then it will take one or two days for the data to show up in the reports after you upgrade to a premium license.

---

### Can I see last month's data after getting an Azure AD premium license?

If you recently switched to a premium version (including a trial version), you can see data up to 7 days initially. When data accumulates, you can see data for the past 30 days.

### When does Azure AD start collecting security signal data?  

For security signals, the collection process starts when you opt-in to use the **Identity Protection Center**.

You can retain the audit and sign-in activity data for longer than the default retention period outlined above by routing it to an Azure storage account using Azure Monitor.
