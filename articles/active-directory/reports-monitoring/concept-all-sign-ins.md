# Azure Active Directory sign-in activity reports - preview

The reporting architecture in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) consists of the following components:

- **Activity** 
    - **Sign-ins** – Information about when users, applications, and managed resources sign in to Azure AD to and access resources.
    - **Audit logs** - [Audit logs](concept-audit-logs.md) provide system activity information about users and group management, managed applications, and directory activities.
- **Security** 
    - **Risky sign-ins** - A [risky sign-in](concept-risky-sign-ins.md) is an indicator for a sign-in attempt by someone who isn't the legitimate owner of a user account.
    - **Users flagged for risk** - A [risky user](concept-user-at-risk.md) is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

The classic sign-ins report in Azure Active Directory provides you with an overview of interactive user sign-ins. In addition, you now have access to three additional sign-in reports that are now in preview:

- Non-interactive user sign-ins

- Service principal sign-ins

- Managed identities for Azure resource sign-ins

This article gives you an overview of the sign-in activity report with the preview of non-interactive, application, and managed identities for Azure resources sign-ins. For information about the sign-in report without the preview features, see  [Sign-in activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](concept-sign-ins.md).



## Prerequisites

Before you can start using this feature, you should know the answers to:

- Who can access the data?

- What Azure AD license do you need to access sign-in activity?

### Who can access the data?

- Users in the Security Administrator, Security Reader, and Report Reader roles

- Global Administrators

- Any user (non-admins) can access their own sign-ins 

### What Azure AD license do you need to access sign-in activity?

Your tenant must have an Azure AD Premium license associated with it to see sign-in activities. See [Getting started with Azure Active Directory Premium](../fundamentals/active-directory-get-started-premium.md) to upgrade your Azure Active Directory edition. It will take a couple of days for the data to show up in the reports after you upgrade to a premium license with no data activities before the upgrade.



## Sign-ins report

The sign-ins report provides answers to the following questions:

- What is the sign-in pattern of a user, application or service?
- How many users, apps or services have signed in over a week?
- What’s the status of these sign-ins?


In the sign-ins report blade, you can switch between:

- **Interactive user sign-ins** - Sign-ins where a user provides an authentication factor, such as a password, a response through an MFA app, a biometric factor, or a QR code.

- **Non-interactive user sign-ins** - Sign-ins performed by a client on behalf of a user. These sign-ins don't require any interaction or authentication factor from the user. For example, authentication and authorization using refresh and access tokens that don't require a user to enter credentials.

- **Service principal sign-ins** - Sign-ins by apps and service principals that do not involve any user. In these sign-ins, the app or service provides a credential on its own behalf to authenticate or access resources.

- **Managed identities for Azure resources sign-ins** - Sign-ins by Azure resources that have secrets managed by Azure. For more information, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)

## User sign-ins

Each tab in the sign-ins blade shows the default columns below. Some tabs have additional columns:

- Sign-in date

- Request ID

- User name or user ID

- Application name or application ID

- Status of the sign-in

- IP address of the device used for the sign-in



### Interactive user sign-ins


Interactive user sign-ins are sign-ins where a user provides an authentication factor to Azure AD or interacts directly with Azure AD or a helper app, such as the Microsoft Authenticator app. The factors users provide include passwords, responses to MFA challenges, biometric factors, or QR codes that a user provides to Azure AD or to a helper app.

This report also includes federated sign-ins from identity providers that are federated to Azure AD.  


**Report size:** small <br> 
**Examples:**

- A user provides username and password in the Azure AD sign-in screen.

- A user passes an SMS MFA challenge.

- A user provides a biometric gesture to unlock their Windows PC with Windows Hello for Business.

- A user is federated to Azure AD with an AD FS SAML assertion.


In addition to the default fields, the interactive sign-ins report also shows: 

- The sign-in location

- Whether conditional access has been applied



You can customize the list view by clicking **Columns** in the toolbar.

![Interactive user sign-in columns](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/columns-interactive.png "Interactive user sign-in columns")





Customizing the view enables you to display additional fields or remove fields that are already displayed.

![All interactive columns](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/all-interactive-columns.png)


Select an item in the list view to get more detailed information about the related sign-in.

![Sign-in activity](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/interactive-user-sign-in-details.png "Interactive user sign-ins")



### Non-interactive user sign-ins

Non-interactive user sign-ins are sign-ins that were performed by a client app or OS components on behalf of a user. Like interactive user sign-ins, these sign-ins are done on behalf of a user. Unlike interactive user sign-ins, these sign-ins do not require the user to provide an authentication factor. Instead, the device or client app uses a token or code to authenticate or access a resource on behalf of a user. In general, the user will perceive these sign-ins as happening in the background of the user’s activity.


**Report size:** Large <br>
**Examples:** 

- A client app uses an OAuth 2.0 refresh token to get an access token.

- A client uses an OAuth 2.0 authorization code to get an access token and refresh token.

- A user performs single sign-on (SSO) to a web or Windows app on an Azure AD joined PC.

- A user signs in to a second Microsoft Office app while they have a session on a mobile device using FOCI (Family of Client IDs).




In addition to the default fields, the non-interactive sign-ins report also shows: 

- Resource ID

- Number of grouped sign-ins




You can't customize the fields shown in this report.


![Disabled columns](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/disabled-columns.png "Disabled columns")

To make it easier to digest the data, non-interactive sign-in events are grouped. Clients often create many non-interactive sign-ins on behalf of the same user in a short time period, which share all the same characteristics except for the time the sign-in was attempted. For example, a client may get an access token once per hour on behalf of a user. If the user or client do not change state, the IP address, resource, and all other information is the same for each access token request. When Azure AD logs multiple sign-ins that are identical other than time and date, those sign-ins will be from the same entity are aggregated into a single row. A row with multiple identical sign-ins (except for date and time issued) will have a value greater than 1 in the # sign-ins column. You can expand the row to see all the different sign-ins and their different time stamps. Sign-ins are aggregated in the non-interactive users when the following data matches:


- Application

- User

- IP address

- Status

- Resource ID


You can:

- Expand a node to see the individual items of a group.  

- Click an individual item to see all details 


![Non-interactive user sign-in details](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/non-interactive-sign-ins-details.png)




## Service principal sign-ins

Unlike interactive and non-interactive user sign-ins, service principal sign-ins do not involve a user. Instead, they are sign-ins by any non-user account, such as apps or service principals (except managed identity sign-in, which are in included only in the managed identity sign-ins report). In these sign-ins, the app or service provides its own credential, such as a certificate or app secret to authenticate or access resources.


**Report size:** Large <br>
**Examples:**

- A service principal uses a certificate to authenticate and access the Microsoft Graph. 

- An application uses a client secret to authenticate in the OAuth Client Credentials flow. 


This report has a default list view that shows:

- Sign-in date

- Request ID

- Service principal name or ID

- Status

- IP address

- Resource name

- Resource ID

- Number of sign-ins

You can't customize the fields shown in this report.

![Disabled columns](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/disabled-columns.png "Disabled columns")

To make it easier to digest the data in the service principal sign-in logs, service principal sign-in events are grouped. Sign-ins from the same entity under the same conditions are aggregated into a single row. You can expand the row to see all the different sign-ins and their different time stamps. Sign-ins are aggregated in the service principal report when the following data matches:

- Service principal name or ID

- Status

- IP address

- Resource name or ID

You can:

- Expand a node to see the individual items of a group.  

- Click an individual item so see all details 


![Column details](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/service-principals-sign-ins-view.png "Column details")




## Managed identity for Azure resources sign-ins 

Managed identity for Azure resources sign-ins are sign-ins that were performed by resources that have their secrets managed by Azure to simplify credential management.

**Report size:** Small <br> 
**Examples:**

A VM with managed credentials uses Azure AD to get an Access Token.   


This report has a default list view that shows:


- Managed identity ID

- Managed identity Name

- Resource

- Resource ID

- Number of grouped sign-ins

You can't customize the fields shown in this report.

To make it easier to digest the data, managed identities for Azure resources sign in logs, non-interactive sign-in events are grouped. Sign-ins from the same entity are aggregated into a single row. You can expand the row to see all the different sign-ins and their different time stamps. Sign-ins are aggregated in the managed identities report when all of the following data matches:

- Managed identity name or ID

- Status

- IP address

- Resource name or ID

Select an item in the list view to display all sign-ins that are grouped under a node.

Select a grouped item to see all details of the sign-in. 


## Filter sign-in activities

By setting a filter, you can narrow down the scope of the returned sign-in data. Azure AD provides you with a broad range of additional filters you can set. When setting your filter, you should always pay special attention to your configured **Date** range filter. A proper date range filter ensures that Azure AD only returns the data you really care about.     

The **Date** range filter enables to you to define a timeframe for the returned data.
Possible values are:

- One month

- Seven days

- Twenty-four hours

- Custom

![Date range filter](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/date-range-filter.png)





### Filter user sign-ins

The filter for interactive and non-interactive sign-ins is the same. Because of this, the filter you have configured for interactive sign-ins is persisted for non-interactive sign-ins and vice versa. 






## Access the new sign-in activity reports 

The sign-ins activity report in the Azure portal provides you with a simple method to switch the preview report on and off. If you have the preview reports enabled, you get a new menu that gives you access to all sign-in activity report types.     


To access the new sign-in reports with non-interactive and application sign-ins: 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Azure Active Directory**.

    ![Select Azure AD](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/azure-services.png)

2. In the **Monitoring** section, click **Sign-ins**.

    ![Select sign-ins](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/sign-ins.png)

3. Click the **Preview** bar.

    ![Enable new view](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/enable-new-preview.png)

4. To switch back to the default view, click the **Preview** bar again. 

    ![Restore classic view](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/switch-back.png)







## Download sign-in activity reports

When you download a sign-in activity report, the following is true:

- You can download the sign-in report as CSV or JSON file.

- You can download up to 100-K records. If you want to download more data, use the reporting API.

- Your download is based on the filter selection you made.

- The number of records you can download is constrained by the [Azure Active Directory report retention policies](reference-reports-data-retention.md). 


![Download reports](./media/concept-all-sign-ins/download-reports.png "Download reports")


Each CSV download consists of six different files:

- Interactive sign-ins

- Auth details of the interactive sign-ins

- Non-interactive sign-ins

- Auth details of the non-interactive sign-ins

- Service principal sign-ins

- Managed identity for Azure resources sign-ins

Each JSON download consists of four different files:

- Interactive sign-ins (includes auth details)

- Non-interactive sign-ins (includes auth details)

- Service principal sign-ins

- Managed identity for Azure resources sign-ins
