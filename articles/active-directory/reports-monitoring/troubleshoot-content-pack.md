# Troubleshooting Azure Active Directory Activity logs content pack errors 

|  |
|--|
|Currently, the Azure AD Power BI content pack uses the Azure AD Graph APIs to retrieve data from your Azure AD tenant. As a result, you may see some disparity between the data available in the content pack and the data retrieved using the [Microsoft Graph APIs for reporting](concept-reporting-api.md). |
|  |

When working with the Power BI Content Pack for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), it is possible that you run into the following errors: 

- [Refresh failed](troubleshoot-content-pack.md#refresh-failed) 
- [Failed to update data source credentials](troubleshoot-content-pack.md#failed-to-update-data-source-credentials) 
- [Importing of data is taking too long](#data-import-is-too-slow) 

This article provides you with information about the possible causes and how to fix these errors.
 
## Refresh failed 
 
**How this error is surfaced**: Email from Power BI or failed status in the refresh history. 


| Cause | How to fix |
| ---   | ---        |
| Refresh failure errors can be caused when the credentials of the users connecting to the content pack have been reset but not updated in the connection settings of the content pack. | In Power BI, locate the dataset corresponding to the Azure AD activity logs dashboard (**Azure Active Directory Activity logs**), choose schedule refresh, and then enter your Azure AD credentials. |
| A refresh can fail due to large datasets. | Currently, the Azure AD Content pack with Power BI can support only small data sets (less than 500,00 rows) because of some limitations around timeouts in the Power BI Service. If you encounter throttling errors or if the refresh fails due to timeout issues, this might because you are trying to fetch a large dataset. Reduce the time period in the query and try again.|
 
 
## Failed to update data source credentials 
 
**How this error is surfaced**: In Power BI, when you connect to the Azure AD activity logs content pack. 

| Cause | How to fix |
| ---   | ---        |
| The connecting user is not a global administrator or a security reader or a security administrator. | Use an account that is either a global administrator or a security reader or a security administrator to access the content packs. |
| Your tenant is not a Premium tenant or doesn't have at least one user with Premium license File. | [File a support ticket](../fundamentals/active-directory-troubleshooting-support-howto.md).|
 


## Data import is too slow 
 
**How this error is surfaced**: In Power BI, after you connect your content pack, the data import process starts to prepare your dashboard for Azure AD activity logs. You see the message: **Importing data...** without any further progress.  

| Cause | How to fix |
| ---   | ---        |
| Depending on the size of your tenant, this step could take anywhere from a few minutes to 30 minutes. | If the message does not change to showing your dashboard within an hour, [file a support ticket](../fundamentals/active-directory-troubleshooting-support-howto.md).|
