# How to: Download logs in Azure Active Directory

The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal gives you access to three types of activity logs:

- **[Sign-ins](concept-sign-ins.md)** – Information about sign-ins and how your resources are used by your users.
- **[Audit](concept-audit-logs.md)** – Information about changes applied to your tenant such as users and group management or updates applied to your tenant’s resources.
- **[Provisioning](concept-provisioning-logs.md)** – Activities performed by the provisioning service, such as the creation of a group in ServiceNow or a user imported from Workday.

Azure AD stores the data in these logs for a limited amount of time. As an IT administrator, you can download your activity logs to have a long-term backup.

This article explains how to download activity logs in Azure AD.  

## What you should know

- In the Azure AD portal, you can find several entry points to the activity logs. For example, the **Activity** section on the [Users](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/MsGraphUsers) or [groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GroupsManagementMenuBlade/AllGroups) page. However, there is only one location that provides you with an initially unfiltered view of the logs: the **Monitoring** section on the [Azure AD](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) page.    

- Azure AD stores activity logs only for a specific period. For more information, see [How long does Azure AD store reporting data?](reference-reports-data-retention.md) 

- By downloading the logs, you can control for how long logs are stored. 

- You can download up to 250 000 records. If you want to download more data, use the reporting API.

- Your download is based on the filter you have set. 

- Azure AD supports the following formats for your download:

    - **CSV** 

    - **JSON** 

- The timestamps in the downloaded files are always based on UTC.



## What license do you need?

The option to download the data of an activity log is available in all editions of Azure AD.


## Who can do it?

While the global administrator works, you should use an account with lower privileges to perform this task. To access the audit logs, the following roles work:

- Report Reader
- Global Reader
- Security Administrator
- Security Reader


## How to do it


**To download an activity log:**

1. Navigate to the activity log view you care about:
 
    - [The sign-ins log](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns)
    
    - [The audit log](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns)    
       
    - [The provisioning log](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/ProvisioningEvents)    
   

2.  **Add** the required filter.
