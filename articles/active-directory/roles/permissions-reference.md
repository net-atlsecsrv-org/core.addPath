# Azure AD built-in roles

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), if another administrator or non-administrator needs to manage Azure AD resources, you assign them an Azure AD role that provides the permissions they need. For example, you can assign roles to allow adding or changing users, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, or managing domain names.

This article lists the Azure AD built-in roles you can assign to allow management of Azure AD resources. For information about how to assign roles, see [Assign Azure AD roles to users](manage-roles-portal.md).

## Application Administrator

Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. Note that users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for both Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions for _other_ apps (for example, non-Microsoft apps or apps that you have registered). You can still _request_ these permissions as part of the app registration, but _granting_ (that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Global Administrator.
>
>This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

## Authentication Administrator

Users with this role can set or reset any authentication method (including passwords) for non-administrators and some roles. Authentication administrators can require users who are non-administrators or assigned to some roles to re-register against existing non-password credentials (for example, MFA or FIDO), and can also revoke **remember MFA on the device**, which prompts for MFA on the next sign-in. For a list of the roles that an Authentication Administrator can read or update authentication methods, see [Password reset permissions](#password-reset-permissions).

The [Privileged authentication administrator](#privileged-authentication-administrator) role has permission to force re-registration and multi-factor authentication for all users.

The [Authentication policy administrator](#authentication-policy-administrator) role has permissions to set the tenant's authentication method policy that determines which methods each user can register and use.

| Role | Manage user's auth methods | Manage per-user MFA | Manage MFA settings | Manage auth method policy | Manage password protection policy |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Authentication administrator | Yes for some users (see above) | Yes for some users (see above) | No | No | No |
| Privileged authentication administrator| Yes for all users | Yes for all users | No | No | No |
| Authentication policy administrator | No |No | Yes | Yes | Yes |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change credentials for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Azure Active Directory. Changing the credentials of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
>
>* Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Azure AD and elsewhere not granted to Authentication Administrators. Through this path an Authentication Administrator can assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
>* Azure subscription owners, who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
>* Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure AD and elsewhere.
>* Administrators in other services outside of Azure AD like Exchange Online, Office Security and Compliance Center, and human resources systems.
>* Non-administrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This role can't manage MFA settings in the legacy MFA management portal or Hardware OATH tokens. The same functions can be accomplished using the [Set-MsolUser](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoluser) commandlet Azure AD Powershell module.

## Cloud Application Administrator

Users in this role have the same permissions as the Application Administrator role, excluding the ability to manage application proxy. This role grants the ability to create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications and application registrations. Users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for both Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions for _other_ apps (for example, non-Microsoft apps or apps that you have registered). You can still _request_ these permissions as part of the app registration, but _granting_ (that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Global Administrator.
>
>This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

## Domain Name Administrator

Users with this role can manage (read, add, verify, update, and delete) domain names. They can also read directory information about users, groups, and applications, as these objects possess domain dependencies. For on-premises environments, users with this role can configure domain names for federation so that associated users are always authenticated on-premises. These users can then sign into Azure AD-based services with their on-premises passwords via single sign-on. Federation settings need to be synced via Azure AD Connect, so users also have permissions to manage Azure AD Connect.

## External ID User Flow Administrator

Users with this role can create and manage user flows (also called "built-in" policies) in the Azure portal. These users can customize HTML/CSS/JavaScript content, change MFA requirements, select claims in the token, manage API connectors, and configure session settings for all user flows in the Azure AD organization. On the other hand, this role does not include the ability to review user data or make changes to the attributes that are included in the organization schema. Changes to Identity Experience Framework policies (also known as custom policies) are also outside the scope of this role.

> | --- | --- |
> | microsoft.directory/b2cUserFlow/allProperties/allTasks | Read and configure user attributes in Azure Active Directory B2C |

## External ID User Flow Attribute Administrator

Users with this role add or delete custom attributes available to all user flows in the Azure AD organization. As such, users with this role can change or add new elements to the end-user schema and impact the behavior of all user flows and indirectly result in changes to what data may be asked of end users and ultimately sent as claims to applications. This role cannot edit user flows.

## External Identity Provider Administrator

This administrator manages federation between Azure AD organizations and external identity providers. With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (e.g. authentication path, service ID, assigned key containers). This user can enable the Azure AD organization to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end-user experiences depends on the type of organization:

* Azure AD organizations for employees and partners: The addition of a federation (e.g. with Gmail) will immediately impact all guest invitations not yet redeemed. See [Adding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md).
* Azure Active Directory B2C organizations: The addition of a federation (for example, with Facebook, or with another Azure AD organization) does not immediately impact end-user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (also called a built-in policy). See [Configuring a Microsoft account as an identity provider](../../active-directory-b2c/identity-provider-microsoft-account.md) for an example. To change user flows, the limited role of "B2C User Flow Administrator" is required.

## Global Administrator

Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure Active Directory, as well as services that use Azure Active Directory identities like Microsoft 365 security center, Microsoft 365 compliance center, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online. Furthermore, Global Administrators can [elevate their access](../../role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin.md) to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups. This allows Global Administrators to get full access to all Azure resources using the respective Azure AD Tenant. The person who signs up for the Azure AD organization becomes a Global Administrator. There can be more than one Global Administrator at your company. Global Administrators can reset the password for any user and all other administrators.

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, Microsoft recommends that you assign the Global Administrator role to fewer than five people in your organization. For more information, see [Best practices for Azure AD roles](best-practices.md).

## Global Reader

Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services but can't take management actions. Global reader is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Assign Global reader instead of Global Administrator for planning, audits, or investigations. Use Global reader in combination with other limited admin roles like Exchange Administrator to make it easier to get work done without the assigning the Global Administrator role. Global reader works with Microsoft 365 admin center, Exchange admin center, SharePoint admin center, Teams admin center, Security center, Compliance center, Azure AD admin center, and Device Management admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Global reader role has a few limitations right now -
>
>- [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com/) - OneDrive admin center does not support the Global reader role
>- [M365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/homepage) - Global reader can't read customer lockbox requests. You won't find the **Customer lockbox requests** tab under **Support** in the left pane of M365 Admin Center.
>- [Office Security & Compliance Center](https://sip.protection.office.com/homepage) - Global reader can't read SCC audit logs, do content search, or see Secure Score.
>- [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) - Global reader cannot read **Teams lifecycle**, **Analytics & reports**, **IP phone device management** and **App catalog**.
>- [Privileged Access Management (PAM)](/office365/securitycompliance/privileged-access-management-overview) doesn't support the Global reader role.
>- [Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection) - Global reader is supported [for central reporting](/azure/information-protection/reports-aip) only, and when your Azure AD organization isn't on the [unified labeling platform](/azure/information-protection/faqs#how-can-i-determine-if-my-tenant-is-on-the-unified-labeling-platform).

Users with this role can change passwords, invalidate refresh tokens, manage service requests, and monitor service health. Invalidating a refresh token forces the user to sign in again. Whether a Helpdesk Administrator can reset a user's password and invalidate refresh tokens depends on the role the user is assigned. For a list of the roles that a Helpdesk Administrator can reset passwords for and invalidate refresh tokens, see [Password reset permissions](#password-reset-permissions).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change passwords for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Azure Active Directory. Changing the password of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
>
>- Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Azure AD and elsewhere not granted to Helpdesk Administrators. Through this path a Helpdesk Administrator may be able to assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
>- Azure subscription owners, who might have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
>- Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure AD and elsewhere.
>- Administrators in other services outside of Azure AD like Exchange Online, Office Security and Compliance Center, and human resources systems.
>- Non-administrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.

Delegating administrative permissions over subsets of users and applying policies to a subset of users is possible with [Administrative Units](administrative-units.md).

This role was previously called "Password Administrator" in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). The "Helpdesk Administrator" name in Azure AD now matches its name in Azure AD PowerShell and the Microsoft Graph API.

## Modern Commerce User

Do not use. This role is automatically assigned from Commerce, and is not intended or supported for any other use. See details below.

The Modern Commerce User role gives certain users permission to access Microsoft 365 admin center and see the left navigation entries for **Home**, **Billing**, and **Support**. The content available in these areas is controlled by [commerce-specific roles](../../cost-management-billing/manage/understand-mca-roles.md) assigned to users to manage products that they bought for themselves or your organization. This might include tasks like paying bills, or for access to billing accounts and billing profiles.

Users with the Modern Commerce User role typically have administrative permissions in other Microsoft purchasing systems, but do not have Global Administrator or Billing administrator roles used to access the admin center.

**When is the Modern Commerce User role assigned?**

* **Self-service purchase in Microsoft 365 admin center** – Self-service purchase gives users a chance to try out new products by buying or signing up for them on their own. These products are managed in the admin center. Users who make a self-service purchase are assigned a role in the commerce system, and the Modern Commerce User role so they can manage their purchases in admin center. Admins can block self-service purchases (for Power BI, Power Apps, Power automate) through [PowerShell](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell). For more information, see [Self-service purchase FAQ](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/self-service-purchase-faq).
* **Purchases from Microsoft commercial marketplace** – Similar to self-service purchase, when a user buys a product or service from Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace, the Modern Commerce User role is assigned if they don’t have the Global Administrator or Billing admin role. In some cases, users might be blocked from making these purchases. For more information, see [Microsoft commercial marketplace](../../marketplace/marketplace-faq-publisher-guide.md#what-could-block-a-customer-from-completing-a-purchase).
* **Proposals from Microsoft** – A proposal is a formal offer from Microsoft for your organization to buy Microsoft products and services. When the person who is accepting the proposal doesn’t have a Global Administrator or Billing admin role in Azure AD, they are assigned both a commerce-specific role to complete the proposal and the Modern Commerce User role to access admin center. When they access the admin center they can only use features that are authorized by their commerce-specific role.
* **Commerce-specific roles** – Some users are assigned commerce-specific roles. If a user isn't a Global or Billing admin, they get the Modern Commerce User role so they can access the admin center.

If the Modern Commerce User role is unassigned from a user, they lose access to Microsoft 365 admin center. If they were managing any products, either for themselves or for your organization, they won’t be able to manage them. This might include assigning licenses, changing payment methods, paying bills, or other tasks for managing subscriptions.

## How to understand role permissions

The schema for permissions loosely follows the REST format of Microsoft Graph:

`<namespace>/<entity>/<propertySet>/<action>`

For example:

`microsoft.directory/applications/credentials/update`

| Permission element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| namespace | Product or service that exposes the task and is prepended with `microsoft`. For example, all tasks in Azure AD use the `microsoft.directory` namespace. |
| entity | Logical feature or component exposed by the service in Microsoft Graph. For example, Azure AD exposes User and Groups, OneNote exposes Notes, and Exchange exposes Mailboxes and Calendars. There is a special `allEntities` keyword for specifying all entities in a namespace. This is often used in roles that grant access to an entire product. |
| propertySet | Specific properties or aspects of the entity for which access is being granted. For example, `microsoft.directory/applications/authentication/read` grants the ability to read the reply URL, logout URL, and implicit flow property on the application object in Azure AD.<ul><li>`allProperties` designates all properties of the entity, including privileged properties.</li><li>`standard` designates common properties, but excludes privileged ones related to `read` action. For example, `microsoft.directory/user/standard/read` includes the ability to read standard properties like public phone number and email address, but not the private secondary phone number or email address used for multi-factor authentication.</li><li>`basic` designates common properties, but excludes privileged ones related to the `update` action. The set of properties that you can read may be different from what you can update. That’s why there are `standard` and `basic` keywords to reflect that.</li></ul> |
| action | Operation being granted, most typically create, read, update, or delete (CRUD). There is a special `allTasks` keyword for specifying all of the above abilities (create, read, update, and delete). |
