# Enterprise application permissions for custom roles in Azure Active Directory

This article contains the currently available enterprise application permissions for custom role definitions in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In this article, you'll find permission lists for some common scenarios and the full list of enterprise app permissions. Application Proxy permissions are not currently rolled out in this release.

## Required license plan

Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license for your Azure AD organization. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Comparing generally available features of the Free, Basic, and Premium editions](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
