# List Azure AD role assignments

This article describes how to list roles you have assigned in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), roles can be assigned at an organization-wide scope or with a single-application scope.

- Role assignments at the organization-wide scope are added to and can be seen in the list of single application role assignments.
- Role assignments at the single application scope aren't added to and can't be seen in the list of organization-wide scoped assignments.

## List role assignments in the Azure portal

This procedure describes how to list role assignments with organization-wide scope.

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with Privileged role administrator or Global administrator permissions in the Azure AD organization.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Roles and administrators**, and then select a role to open it and view its properties.
1. Select **Assignments** to list the role assignments.

## List my role assignments

It's easy to list your own permissions as well. Select **Your Role** on the **Roles and administrators** page to see the roles that are currently assigned to you.

## Download role assignments

To download all assignments for a specific role, on the **Roles and administrators** page, select a role, and then select **Download role assignments**. A CSV file that lists assignments at all scopes for that role is downloaded.

## List role assignments using Azure AD PowerShell

This section describes viewing assignments of a role with organization-wide scope. This article uses the [Azure Active Directory PowerShell Version 2](/powershell/module/azuread/#directory_roles) module. To view single-application scope assignments using PowerShell, you can use the cmdlets in [Assign custom roles with PowerShell](custom-assign-powershell.md).

### Prepare PowerShell

First, you must [download the Azure AD preview PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureAD/).

To install the Azure AD PowerShell module, use the following commands:

``` PowerShell
Install-Module -Name AzureADPreview
Import-Module -Name AzureADPreview
```

To verify that the module is ready to use, use the following command:

``` PowerShell
Get-Module -Name AzureADPreview
  ModuleType Version      Name                         ExportedCommands
  ---------- ---------    ----                         ----------------
  Binary     2.0.0.115    AzureADPreview               {Add-AzureADAdministrati...}
```

### List role assignments

Example of listing the role assignments.

``` PowerShell
# Fetch list of all directory roles with object ID
Get-AzureADDirectoryRole

# Fetch a specific directory role by ID
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole -ObjectId "5b3fe201-fa8b-4144-b6f1-875829ff7543"

# Fetch role membership for a role
Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId | Get-AzureADUser
```

## List role assignments using Microsoft Graph API

This section describes how to list role assignments with organization-wide scope.  To list single-application scope role assignments using Graph API, you can use the operations in [Assign custom roles with Graph API](custom-assign-graph.md).

HTTP request to get a role assignment for a given role definition.

GET

``` HTTP
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments&$filter=roleDefinitionId eq ‘<object-id-or-template-id-of-role-definition>’
```

Response

    "roleDefinitionId":"3671d40a-1aac-426c-a0c1-a3821ebd8218",
    "resourceScopes":["/"]
}
```

## List role assignments with single-application scope

This section describes how to list role assignments with single-application scope. This feature is currently in public preview.

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with Privileged role administrator or Global administrator permissions in the Azure AD organization.
1. Select **App registrations**, and then select the app registration to view its properties. You might have to select **All applications** to see the complete list of app registrations in your Azure AD organization.

    ![Create or edit app registrations from the App registrations page](./media/view-assignments/app-reg-all-apps.png)

1. In the app registration, select **Roles and administrators**, and then select a role to view its properties.

    ![List app registration role assignments from the App registrations page](./media/view-assignments/app-reg-assignments.png)

1. Select **Assignments** to list the role assignments. Opening the assignments page from within the app registration shows you the role assignments that are scoped to this Azure AD resource.
