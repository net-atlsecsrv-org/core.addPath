# Add and manage users in an administrative unit in Azure Active Directory

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can add users to an administrative unit (AU) for more granular administrative scope of control.

For steps to prepare to use PowerShell and Microsoft Graph for administrative unit management, see [Get started](admin-units-manage.md#get-started).

## Add users to an AU

### Azure portal

You can assign users to administrative units individually or in a bulk operation.

- Individual assignment from a user profile

   1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://portal.azure.com) with Privileged Role Administrator permissions.
   1. Select **Users** and select the user to be assigned to an administrative unit to open the user's profile.
   1. Select **Administrative units**. The user can be assigned to one or more administrative units by selecting **Assign to administrative unit** and selecting the administrative units where the user is to be assigned.

- Individual assignment from an administrative unit

   1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://portal.azure.com) with Privileged Role Administrator permissions.
   1. Select **Administrative units** and then select the administrative unit where the users are to be assigned.
   1. Select **All users** and then select **Add member** to select one or more users to be assigned to the administrative unit from the **Add member** pane.

- Bulk assignment

   1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://portal.azure.com) with Privileged Role Administrator permissions.
   1. Select **Administrative units**.
   1. Select the administrative unit where users are to be added.
   1. Open **All users** > **Add members from .csv file**. You can then download the comma-separated values (CSV) template and edit the file. The format is simple and needs a single User Principal Name to be added in each line. Once the file is ready, save it at an appropriate location and then upload it as part of this step.

    ![bulk assign users to an administrative unit](./media/admin-units-add-manage-users/bulk-assign-to-admin-unit.png)

### PowerShell

```powershell
$administrativeunitObj = Get-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnit -Filter "displayname eq 'Test administrative unit 2'"
$UserObj = Get-AzureADUser -Filter "UserPrincipalName eq 'billjohn@fabidentity.onmicrosoft.com'"
Add-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnitMember -Id $administrativeunitObj.ObjectId -RefObjectId $UserObj.ObjectId
```

In the above example, the cmdlet Add-AzureADAdministrativeUnitMember is used to add the user to the administrative unit. The object ID of the administrative unit where user is to be added and the object ID of the user who is to be added are taken as argument. The highlighted section may be changed as required for the specific environment.

### Microsoft Graph

```http
Http request
POST /administrativeUnits/{Admin Unit id}/members/$ref
Request body
{
  "@odata.id":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}"
}
```

Example:

```http
{
  "@odata.id":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/johndoe@fabidentity.com"
}
```

## List administrative units for a user

### Azure portal

In the Azure portal you can open a user's profile by:

1. Opening **Azure AD** > **Users**.

1. Select the user to open the user's profile.

1. Select **Administrative units** to see the list of administrative units where the user has been assigned.

   ![List the administrative units for a user](./media/admin-units-add-manage-users/list-user-admin-units.png)

### PowerShell

```powershell
Get-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnit | where { Get-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnitMember -Id $_.ObjectId | where {$_.RefObjectId -eq $userObjId} }
```
Note: By default, Get-AzureADAdministrativeUnitMember only returns 100 members, you can add "-All $true" to retrieve more members.

### Microsoft Graph

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/memberOf/$/Microsoft.Graph.AdministrativeUnit
```

## Remove a single user from an AU

### Azure portal

There are two ways you can remove a user from an administrative unit. In the Azure portal you can open a user's profile by going to **Azure AD** > **Users**. Select the user to open the user's profile. Select the administrative unit you want the user to be removed from and select **Remove from administrative unit**.

![Remove a user from an administrative unit from the user profile](./media/admin-units-add-manage-users/user-remove-admin-units.png)

You can also remove a user in **Azure AD** > **Administrative units** by selecting the administrative unit you want to remove users from. Select the user and select **Remove member**.
  
![Remove a user at the administrative unit level](./media/admin-units-add-manage-users/admin-units-remove-user.png)

### PowerShell

```powershell
Remove-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnitMember -Id $auId -MemberId $memberUserObjId
```

### Microsoft Graph

   https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directory/administrativeUnits/{adminunit-id}/members/{user-id}/$ref

## Bulk remove more than one user

You can go to Azure AD > Administrative units and select the administrative unit you want to remove users from. Click on Bulk remove member. Download the CSV template for providing the list of users to be removed.

Edit the downloaded CSV template with the relevant user entries. Do not remove the first two rows of the template. Add one user UPN in each row.

![Edit the CSV file for bulk user removal from administrative units](./media/admin-units-add-manage-users/bulk-user-entries.png)

Once you have saved the entries in the file, upload the file, select **Submit**.
