# Tutorial: Bulk invite Azure AD B2B collaboration users (preview)

|     |

| This article describes a public preview feature of Azure Active Directory. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).|

> [!NOTE]
> As of 12/22/2019, the Bulk invite users (Preview) feature has been temporarily disabled.

If you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B collaboration to work with external partners, you can invite multiple guest users to your organization at the same time. In this tutorial, you learn how to use the Azure portal to send bulk invitations to external users. Specifically, you do the following:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use **Bulk invite users (Preview)** to prepare a comma-separated value (.csv) file with the user information and invitation preferences
> * Upload the .csv file to Azure AD
> * Verify the users were added to the directory

If you don’t have Azure Active Directory, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. 

## Prerequisites

You need two or more test email accounts that you can send the invitations to. The accounts must be from outside your organization. You can use any type of account, including social accounts such as gmail.com or outlook.com addresses.

## Invite guest users in bulk

1. Sign in to the Azure portal with an account that is a User administrator in the organization.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Users** > **Bulk invite**.
4. On the **Bulk invite users (Preview)** page, select **Download** to get a valid .csv file with invitation properties.

5. Open the .csv file and add a line for each guest user. Required values are:

   * **Email address to invite** - the user who will receive an invitation

   * **Redirection url** - the URL to which the invited user is forwarded after accepting the invitation

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't use commas in the **Customized invitation message** because they'll prevent the message from being parsed successfully.

6. Save the file.
7. On the **Bulk invite users (Preview)** page, under **Upload your csv file**, browse to the file. When you select the file, validation of the .csv file starts. 
8. When the file contents are validated, you’ll see **File uploaded successfully**. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can submit the job.
9. When your file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the Azure bulk operation that adds the invitations. 
10. To view the job status, select **Click here to view the status of each operation**. Or, you can select **Bulk operation results (Preview)** in the **Activity** section. For details about each line item within the the bulk operation, select the values under the **# Success**, **# Failure**, or **Total Requests** columns. If failures occurred, the reasons for failure will be listed.

11. When the job completes, you'll see a notification that the bulk operation succeeded.

## Verify guest users in the directory

Check to see that the guest users you added exist in the directory either in the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.

### View guest users in the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the Azure portal with an account that is a User administrator in the organization.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.
4. Under **Show**, select **Guest users only** and verify the users you added are listed.

### View guest users with PowerShell

Run the following command:

```powershell
 Get-AzureADUser -Filter "UserType eq 'Guest'"
```

You should see the users that you invited listed, with a user principal name (UPN) in the format *emailaddress*#EXT#\@*domain*. For example, *lstokes_fabrikam.com#EXT#\@contoso.onmicrosoft.com*, where contoso.onmicrosoft.com is the organization from which you sent the invitations.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the test user accounts in the directory in the Azure portal on the Users page by selecting the checkbox next to the guest user and then selecting **Delete**. 

Or you can run the following PowerShell command to delete a user account:

```powershell
 Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId "<UPN>"
```

For example: `Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId "lstokes_fabrikam.com#EXT#@contoso.onmicrosoft.com"`

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you sent bulk invitations to guest users outside of your organization. Next, learn how the invitation redemption process works.
