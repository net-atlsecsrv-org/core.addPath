# Leave an organization as a guest user

An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B guest user can decide to leave an organization at any time if they no longer need to use apps from that organization or maintain any association. A user can leave an organization on their own, without having to contact an administrator.

## Leave an organization

To leave an organization, follow these steps.

1. Go to your Access Panel Profile page by doing one of the following:
   
   - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), click your name in the upper right and select **View account**.
   - Open your [Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com), click your name in the upper right, and next to **Organizations**, select the settings icon (gear).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you’re not already signed in to the organization you want to leave, under **Organizations**, click the **Sign in to leave organization** link next to the organization’s name. After you’re signed in, click your name again in the upper right and next to **Organizations**, select the settings icon (gear).

3. Under **Organizations**, find the organization that you want to leave, and select **Leave organization**.

4. When asked to confirm, select **Leave**. 

## Account removal

When a user leaves an organization, the user account is "soft deleted" in the directory. By default, the user object moves to the **Deleted users** area in Azure AD but is not permanently deleted for 30 days. This soft deletion enables the administrator to restore the user account (including groups and permissions), if the user makes a request to restore the account within the 30-day period.

If desired, a tenant administrator can permanently delete the account at any time during the 30-day period. To do this:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Azure Active Directory**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.
3. Select **Deleted users**.
4. Select the check box next to a deleted user, and then select **Delete permanently**.

If you permanently delete a user, this action is irrevocable.
