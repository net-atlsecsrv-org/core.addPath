# Add an API connector to a user flow

To use an [API connector](api-connectors-overview.md), you first create the API connector and then enable it in a user flow.

## Create an API connector

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as an Azure AD administrator.
2. Under **Azure services**, select **Azure Active Directory**.
3. In the left menu, select **External Identities**.
4. Select **All API connectors (Preview)**, and then select **New API connector**.

   ![Add a new API connector](./media/self-service-sign-up-add-api-connector/api-connector-new.png)

5. Provide a display name for the call. For example, **Check approval status**.
6. Provide the **Endpoint URL** for the API call.
7. Provide the authentication information for the API.

   - Only Basic Authentication is currently supported. If you wish to use an API without Basic Authentication for development purposes, simply enter a dummy **Username** and **Password** that your API can ignore. For use with an Azure Function with an API key, you can include the code as a query parameter in the **Endpoint URL** (for example, https[]()://contoso.azurewebsites.net/api/endpoint<b>?code=0123456789</b>).

   ![Add a new API connector](./media/self-service-sign-up-add-api-connector/api-connector-config.png)

8. Select the claims you want to send to the API.
9. Select any claims you plan to receive back from the API.

   <!-- ![Set API connector claims](./media/self-service-sign-up-add-api-connector/api-connector-claims.png) -->

10. Select **Save**.

### Selection of 'Claims to send' and 'Claims to receive'
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may see all the claims selected by default as illustrated below. All API connectors will be updated to behave this way. Your API will receive all available claims and can send back any supported claim without configuring them in the API connector definition.

## Enable the API connector in a user flow

Follow these steps to add an API connector to a self-service sign-up user flow.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as an Azure AD administrator.
2. Under **Azure services**, select **Azure Active Directory**.
3. In the left menu, select **External Identities**.
4. Select **User flows (Preview)**, and then select the user flow you want to add the API connector to.
5. Select **API connectors**, and then select the API endpoints you want to invoke at the following steps in the user flow:

   - **After signing in with an identity provider**
   - **Before creating the user**

6. Select **Save**.

Learn about [where you can enable an API connector in a user flow](api-connectors-overview.md#where-you-can-enable-an-api-connector-in-a-user-flow).

## Request sent to the API

An API connector materializes as an HTTP POST request, sending selected claims as key-value pairs in a JSON body. The response should also have the HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json`. Attributes are serialized similarly to Microsoft Graph user attributes. <!--# TODO: Add link to MS Graph or create separate reference.-->

### Example request

```http
POST <API-endpoint>
Content-type: application/json

{
 "email": "johnsmith@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com",
 "identities": [ //Sent for Google and Facebook identity providers
     {
     "signInType":"federated",
     "issuer":"facebook.com",
     "issuerAssignedId":"0123456789"
     }
 ],
 "displayName": "John Smith",
 "postalCode": "33971",
 "extension_<extensions-app-id>_CustomAttribute1": "custom attribute value",
 "extension_<extensions-app-id>_CustomAttribute2": "custom attribute value",
 "ui_locales":"en-US"
}
```

The **UI Locales ('ui_locales')** claim is sent by default in all requests. It provides a user's locale(s) and can be used by the API to return internationalized responses. It doesn't appear in the API configuration pane.

If a claim to send does not have a value at the time the API endpoint is called, the claim will not be sent to the API.

Custom attributes can be created for the user using the **extension_\<extensions-app-id>_AttributeName** format. Your API should expect to receive claims in this same serialized format. Your API can return claims with or without the `<extensions-app-id>`. For more information about custom attributes, see [define custom attributes for self-service sign-up flows](user-flow-add-custom-attributes.md).

> [!TIP] 
> [**identities ('identities')**](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/objectidentity?view=graph-rest-1.0) and the **Email Address ('email')** claims can be used to identify a user before they have an account in your tenant. The 'identities' claim is sent when a user authenticates with a Google or Facebook and 'email' is always sent.

## Expected response types from the web API

When the web API receives an HTTP request from Azure AD during a user flow, it can return these responses:

- [Continuation response](#continuation-response)
- [Blocking response](#blocking-response)
- [Validation-error response](#validation-error-response)

### Continuation response

A continuation response indicates that the user flow should continue to the next step. In a continuation response, the API can return claims.

If a claim is returned by the API and selected as a **Claim to receive**, the claim does the following:

- Pre-fills input fields in the attribute collection page if the API connector is invoked before the page is presented.
- Overrides any value that has already been assigned to the claim.
- Assigns a value to the claim if it was previously null.

#### Example of a continuation response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "action": "Continue",
    "postalCode": "12349", // return claim
    "extension_<extensions-app-id>_CustomAttribute": "value" // return claim
}
```

| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| version                                            | String            | Yes      | The version of the API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| action                                             | String            | Yes      | Value must be `Continue`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| \<builtInUserAttribute>                            | \<attribute-type> | No       | Values can be stored in the directory if they selected as a **Claim to receive** in the API connector configuration and **User attributes** for a user flow. Values can be returned in the token if selected as an **Application claim**.                                              |
| \<extension\_{extensions-app-id}\_CustomAttribute> | \<attribute-type> | No       | The returned claim does not need to contain `_<extensions-app-id>_`. Values are be stored in the directory if they selected as a **Claim to receive** in the API connector configuration and **User attribute** for a user flow. Custom attributes cannot be sent back in the token. |

### Blocking Response

A blocking response exits the user flow. It can be purposely issued by the API to stop the continuation of the user flow by displaying a block page to the user. The block page displays the `userMessage` provided by the API.

Example of the blocking response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "action": "ShowBlockPage",
    "userMessage": "There was a problem with your request. You are not able to sign up at this time.",
    "code": "CONTOSO-BLOCK-00"
}

```

| Parameter   | Type   | Required | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| version     | String | Yes      | The version of the API.                                                    |
| action      | String | Yes      | Value must be `ShowBlockPage`                                              |
| userMessage | String | Yes      | Message to display to the user.                                            |
| code        | String | No       | Error code. Can be used for debugging purposes. Not displayed to the user. |

#### End-user experience with a blocking response

### Validation-error response

An API call invoked after an attribute collection page may return a validation-error response. When doing so, the user flow stays on the attribute collection page and the `userMessage` is displayed to the user. The user can then edit and resubmit the form. This type of response can be used for input validation.

#### Example of a validation-error response

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-type: application/json

{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "status": 400,
    "action": "ValidationError",
    "userMessage": "Please enter a valid Postal Code.",
    "code": "CONTOSO-VALIDATION-00"
}
```

| Parameter   | Type    | Required | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| version     | String  | Yes      | The version of the API.                                                    |
| action      | String  | Yes      | Value must be `ValidationError`.                                           |
| status      | Integer | Yes      | Must be value `400` for a ValidationError response.                        |
| userMessage | String  | Yes      | Message to display to the user.                                            |
| code        | String  | No       | Error code. Can be used for debugging purposes. Not displayed to the user. |

### Integration with Azure Functions
You can use an HTTP trigger in Azure Functions as a simple way create an API to use with the API connector. You use the Azure Function to, [for example](code-samples-self-service-sign-up.md#api-connector-azure-function-quickstarts), perform validation logic and limit sign-ups to specific domains. You can also call and invoke other web APIs, user stores, and other cloud services.
