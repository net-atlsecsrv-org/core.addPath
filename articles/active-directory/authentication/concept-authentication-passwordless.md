# Passwordless authentication options for Azure Active Directory

Features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) are a great way to secure your organization, but users often get frustrated with the additional security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. Passwordless authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have, plus something you are or something you know.

| Authentication  | Something you have | Something you are or know |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Passwordless | Windows 10 Device, phone, or security key | Biometric or PIN |

Each organization has different needs when it comes to authentication. Microsoft offers the following three passwordless authentication options that integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

- Windows Hello for Business
- Microsoft Authenticator app
- FIDO2 security keys

![Authentication: Security versus convenience](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/passwordless-convenience-security.png)

## Windows Hello for Business

Windows Hello for Business is ideal for information workers that have their own designated Windows PC. The biometric and PIN credentials are directly tied to the user's PC, which prevents access from anyone other than the owner. With public key infrastructure (PKI) integration and built-in support for single sign-on (SSO), Windows Hello for Business provides a convenient method for seamlessly accessing corporate resources on-premises and in the cloud.

![Example of a user sign-in with Windows Hello for Business](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/windows-hellow-sign-in.jpeg)

The following steps show how the sign-in process works with Azure AD:

![Diagram that outlines the steps involved for user sign-in with Windows Hello for Business](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/windows-hello-flow.png)

1. A user signs into Windows using biometric or PIN gesture. The gesture unlocks the Windows Hello for Business private key and is sent to the Cloud Authentication security support provider, referred to as the *Cloud AP provider*.
1. The Cloud AP provider requests a nonce (a random arbitrary number that can be used just once) from Azure AD.
1. Azure AD returns a nonce that's valid for 5 minutes.
1. The Cloud AP provider signs the nonce using the user's private key and returns the signed nonce to the Azure AD.
1. Azure AD validates the signed nonce using the user's securely registered public key against the nonce signature. After validating the signature, Azure AD then validates the returned signed nonce. When the nonce is validated, Azure AD creates a primary refresh token (PRT) with session key that is encrypted to the device's transport key and returns it to the Cloud AP provider.
1. The Cloud AP provider receives the encrypted PRT with session key. Using the device's private transport key, the Cloud AP provider decrypts the session key and protects the session key using the device's Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
1. The Cloud AP provider returns a successful authentication response to Windows. The user is then able to access Windows as well as cloud and on-premises applications without the need to authenticate again (SSO).

The Windows Hello for Business [planning guide](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-planning-guide) can be used to help you make decisions on the type of Windows Hello for Business deployment and the options you'll need to consider.

## Microsoft Authenticator App

You can also allow your employee's phone to become a passwordless authentication method. You may already be using the Microsoft Authenticator App as a convenient multi-factor authentication option in addition to a password. You can also use the Authenticator App as a passwordless option.

![Sign in to Microsoft Edge with the Microsoft Authenticator app](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/concept-web-sign-in-microsoft-authenticator-app.png)

The Authenticator App turns any iOS or Android phone into a strong, passwordless credential. Users can sign in to any platform or browser by getting a notification to their phone, matching a number displayed on the screen to the one on their phone, and then using their biometric (touch or face) or PIN to confirm. Refer to [Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app](../user-help/user-help-auth-app-download-install.md) for installation details.

Passwordless authentication using the Authenticator app follows the same basic pattern as Windows Hello for Business. It's a little more complicated as the user needs to be identified so that Azure AD can find the Microsoft Authenticator App version being used:

![Diagram that outlines the steps involved for user sign-in with the Microsoft Authenticator App](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/authenticator-app-flow.png)

1. The user enters their username.
1. Azure AD detects that the user has a strong credential and starts the Strong Credential flow.
1. A notification is sent to the app via Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) on iOS devices, or via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) on Android devices.
1. The user receives the push notification and opens the app.
1. The app calls Azure AD and receives a proof-of-presence challenge and nonce.
1. The user completes the challenge by entering their biometric or PIN to unlock private key.
1. The nonce is signed with the private key and sent back to Azure AD.
1. Azure AD performs public/private key validation and returns a token.

## FIDO2 security keys

The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance helps to promote open authentication standards and reduce the user of passwords as a form of authentication. FIDO2 is the latest standard that incorporates the web authentication (WebAuthn) standard.

FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an open standard for passwordless authentication. FIDO allows users and organizations to leverage the standard to sign in to their resources without a username or password using an external security key or a platform key built into a device.

Users can register and then select a FIDO2 security key at the sign-in interface as their main means of authentication. These FIDO2 security keys are typically USB devices, but could also use Bluetooth or NFC. With a hardware device that handles the authentication, the security of an account is increased as there's no password that could be exposed or guessed.

FIDO2 security keys can be used to sign in to their Azure AD or hybrid Azure AD joined Windows 10 devices and get single-sign on to their cloud and on-premises resources. Users can also sign in to supported browsers. FIDO2 security keys are a great option for enterprises who are very security sensitive or have scenarios or employees who aren't willing or able to use their phone as a second factor.

Sign-in with FIDO2 security keys to Azure AD are currently in preview. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

![Sign in to Microsoft Edge with a security key](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/concept-web-sign-in-security-key.png)

The following process is used when a user signs in with a FIDO2 security key:

![Diagram that outlines the steps involved for user sign-in with a FIDO2 security key](./media/concept-authentication-passwordless/fido2-security-key-flow.png)

1. The user plugs the FIDO2 security key into their computer.
2. Windows detects the FIDO2 security key.
3. Windows sends an authentication request.
4. Azure AD sends back a nonce.
5. The user completes their gesture to unlock the private key stored in the FIDO2 security key's secure enclave.
6. The FIDO2 security key signs the nonce with the private key.
7. The primary refresh token (PRT) token request with signed nonce is sent to Azure AD.
8. Azure AD verifies the signed nonce using the FIDO2 public key.
9. Azure AD returns PRT to enable access to on-premises resources.

While there are many keys that are FIDO2 certified by the FIDO Alliance, Microsoft requires some optional extensions of the FIDO2 Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) specification to be implemented by the vendor to ensure maximum security and the best experience.

A security key **MUST** implement the following features and extensions from the FIDO2 CTAP protocol to be Microsoft-compatible:

| # | Feature / Extension trust | Why is this feature or extension required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Resident key | This feature enables the security key to be portable, where your credential is stored on the security key. |
| 2 | Client pin | This feature enables you to protect your credentials with a second factor and applies to security keys that do not have a user interface. |
| 3 | hmac-secret | This extension ensures you can sign in to your device when it's off-line or in airplane mode. |
| 4 | Multiple accounts per RP | This feature ensures you can use the same security key across multiple services like Microsoft Account and Azure Active Directory. |

### FIDO2 security key providers

The following providers offer FIDO2 security keys of different form factors that are known to be compatible with the passwordless experience. We encourage you to evaluate the security properties of these keys by contacting the vendor as well as FIDO Alliance.

## What scenarios work with the preview?

Azure AD passwordless sign-in features are currently in preview. The following considerations apply:

- Administrators can enable passwordless authentication methods for their tenant
- Administrators can target all users or select users/groups within their tenant for each method
- End users can register and manage these passwordless authentication methods in their account portal
- End users can sign in with these passwordless authentication methods
   - Microsoft Authenticator App: Works in scenarios where Azure AD authentication is used, including across all browsers, during Windows 10 Out Of Box (OOBE) setup, and with integrated mobile apps on any operating system.
   - Security keys: Work on lock screen for Windows 10 and the web in supported browsers like Microsoft Edge (both legacy and new Edge).
