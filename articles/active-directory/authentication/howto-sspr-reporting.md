# Reporting options for Azure AD password management

After deployment, many organizations want to know how or if self-service password reset (SSPR) is really being used. The reporting feature that Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides helps you answer questions by using prebuilt reports. If you're appropriately licensed, you can also create custom queries.

![Reporting on SSPR using the audit logs in Azure AD][Reporting]

The following questions can be answered by the reports that exist in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

> [!NOTE]
> You must be [a global administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md), and you must opt-in for this data to be gathered on behalf of your organization. To opt in, you must visit the **Reporting** tab or the audit logs at least once. Until then, data is not collected for your organization.
>

* How many people have registered for password reset?
* Who has registered for password reset?
* What data are people registering?
* How many people reset their passwords in the last seven days?
* What are the most common methods that  users or admins use to reset their passwords?
* What are common problems users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?
* What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?
* Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?

## How to view password management reports in the Azure portal

In the Azure portal experience, we have improved the way that you can view password reset and password reset registration activity. Use the following the steps to find the password reset and password reset registration events:

1. Browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All services** in the left pane.
3. Search for **Azure Active Directory** in the list of services and select it.
4. Select **Users** from the Manage section.
5. Select **Audit Logs** from the **Users** blade. This shows you all of the audit events that occurred against all the users in your directory. You can filter this view to see all the password-related events.
6. From the **Filter** menu at the top of the pane, select the **Service** drop-down list, and change it to the **Self-service Password Management** service type.
7. Optionally, further filter the list by choosing the specific **Activity** you're interested in.

### Combined registration

If you have enabled [combined registration](./concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md), information regarding user activity in the audit logs will be found under **Security** > **Authentication Methods**.

## Description of the report columns in the Azure portal

The following list explains each of the report columns in the Azure portal in detail:

* **User**: The user who attempted a password reset registration operation.
* **Role**: The role of the user in the directory.
* **Date and Time**: The date and time of the attempt.
* **Data Registered**: The authentication data that the user provided during password reset registration.

## Description of the report values in the Azure portal

The following table describes the different values that are you can set for each column in the Azure portal:

| Column | Permitted values and their meanings |
| --- | --- |
| Data registered |**Alternate email**: The user used an alternate email or authentication email to authenticate.<p><p>**Office phone**: The user used an office phone to authenticate.<p>**Mobile phone**: The user used a mobile phone or authentication phone to authenticate.<p>**Security questions**: The user used security questions to authenticate.<p>**Any combination of the previous methods, for example, alternate email + mobile phone**: Occurs when a two-gate policy is specified and shows which two methods the user used to authentication their password reset request. |
