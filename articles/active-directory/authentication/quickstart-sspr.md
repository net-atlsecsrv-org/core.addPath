# Customer intent: As an Azure AD Administrator, I want to protect user authentication so I deploy SSPR so that when users have trouble signing-in they can reset their passwords using something they know.

# Quickstart: Self-service password reset

In this quickstart, you walk through configuring self-service password reset (SSPR) as a simple means for IT administrators to enable users to reset their passwords or unlock their accounts.

## Prerequisites

* A working Azure AD tenant with at least a trial license enabled.
* An account with Global Administrator privileges.
* A non-administrator test user with a password you know, if you need to create a user see the article [Quickstart: Add new users to Azure Active Directory](../add-users-azure-active-directory.md).
* A pilot group to test with that the non-administrator test user is a member of, if you need to create a group see the article [Create a group and add members in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md).

## Enable self-service password reset

[View this process as a video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Pa0eyqjEjvQ)

1. From your existing Azure AD tenant, on the **Azure portal** under **Azure Active Directory** select **Password reset**.

2. From the **Properties** page, under the option **Self Service Password Reset Enabled**, choose **Selected**.
    * From **Select group**, choose your pilot group created as part of the prerequisites section of this article.
    * Click **Save**.

3. From the **Authentication methods** page, make the following choices:
   * Number of methods required to reset: **1**
   * Methods available to users:
      * **Email**
      * **Mobile app code (preview)**
   * Click **Save**.

4. From the **Registration** page, make the following choices:
   * Require users to register when they sign in: **Yes**
   * Set the number of days before users are asked to reconfirm their authentication information: **365**

## Test self-service password reset

Now lets test your SSPR configuration with a test user. Since Microsoft enforces strong authentication requirements for Azure administrator accounts, testing using an administrator account may change the outcome. For more information regarding the administrator password policy, see our [password policy](concept-sspr-policy.md) article.

1. Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode, and browse to [https://aka.ms/ssprsetup](https://aka.ms/ssprsetup).
2. Sign in with a non-administrator test user, and register your authentication phone.
3. Once complete, click the button marked **looks good** and close the browser window.
4. Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode, and browse to [https://aka.ms/sspr](https://aka.ms/sspr).
5. Enter your non-administrator test users' User ID, the characters from the CAPTCHA, and then click **Next**.
6. Follow the verification steps to reset your password

## Clean up resources

It's easy to disable self-service password reset. Open your Azure AD tenant and go to **Properties** > **Password Reset**, and then select **None** under **Self Service Password Reset Enabled**.
