# Getting started with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication and Active Directory Federation Services

<center>

![Azure AD MFA and ADFS getting started](./media/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-adfs/adfs.png)</center>

If your organization has federated your on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory using AD FS, there are two options for using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication.

* Secure cloud resources using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication or Active Directory Federation Services
* Secure cloud and on-premises resources using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server

The following table summarizes the verification experience between securing resources with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication and AD FS

| Verification Experience - Browser-based Apps | Verification Experience - Non-Browser-based Apps |
|:--- |:--- |
| Securing Azure AD resources using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication |<li>The first verification step is performed on-premises using AD FS.</li> <li>The second step is a phone-based method carried out using cloud authentication.</li> |
| Securing Azure AD resources using Active Directory Federation Services |<li>The first verification step is performed on-premises using AD FS.</li><li>The second step is performed on-premises by honoring the claim.</li> |

Caveats with app passwords for federated users:

* App passwords are verified using cloud authentication, so they bypass federation. Federation is only actively used when setting up an app password.
* On-premises Client Access Control settings are not honored by app passwords.
* You lose on-premises authentication-logging capability for app passwords.
* Account disable/deletion may take up to three hours for directory sync, delaying disable/deletion of app passwords in the cloud identity.

For information on setting up either Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication or the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server with AD FS, see the following articles:
