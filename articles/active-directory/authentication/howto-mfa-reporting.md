# Reports in Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provides several reports that can be used by you and your organization accessible through the Azure portal. The following table lists the available reports:

| Report | Location | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Blocked User History | Azure AD > Security > MFA > Block/unblock users | Shows the history of requests to block or unblock users. |
| Usage and fraud alerts | Azure AD > Sign-ins | Provides information on overall usage, user summary, and user details; as well as a history of fraud alerts submitted during the date range specified. |
| Usage for on-premises components | Azure AD > Security > MFA > Activity Report | Provides information on overall usage for MFA through the NPS extension, ADFS, and MFA server. |
| Bypassed User History | Azure AD > Security > MFA > One-time bypass | Provides a history of requests to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication for a user. |
| Server status | Azure AD > Security > MFA > Server status | Displays the status of Multi-Factor Authentication Servers associated with your account. |

## View MFA reports

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the left, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **MFA**.
3. Select the report that you wish to view.

## Azure AD sign-ins report

With the **sign-ins activity report** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can get the information you need to determine how your environment is doing.

The sign-ins report can provide you with information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities, which includes information about multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage. The MFA data gives you insights into how MFA is working in your organization. It enables you to answer questions like:

- Was the sign-in challenged with MFA?
- How did the user complete MFA?
- Why was the user unable to complete MFA?
- How many users are challenged for MFA?
- How many users are unable to complete the MFA challenge?
- What are the common MFA issues end users are running into?

This data is available through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and the [reporting API](../reports-monitoring/concept-reporting-api.md).

### Sign-ins report structure

The sign-in activity reports for MFA give you access to the following information:

**MFA required:** Whether MFA is required for the sign-in or not. MFA can be required due to per-user MFA, Conditional Access, or other reasons. Possible values are **Yes** or **No**.

**MFA Result:** More information on whether MFA was satisfied or denied:

- If MFA was satisfied, this column provides more information about how MFA was satisfied.
   - Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
      - completed in the cloud
      - has expired due to the policies configured on tenant
      - registration prompted
      - satisfied by claim in the token
      - satisfied by claim provided by external provider
      - satisfied by strong authentication
      - skipped as flow exercised was Windows broker logon flow
      - skipped due to app password
      - skipped due to location
      - skipped due to registered device
      - skipped due to remembered device
      - successfully completed
   - Redirected to external provider for multi-factor authentication

- If MFA was denied, this column would provide the reason for denial.
   - Azure Multi-Factor Authentication denied;
      - authentication in-progress
      - duplicate authentication attempt
      - entered incorrect code too many times
      - invalid authentication
      - invalid mobile app verification code
      - misconfiguration
      - phone call went to voicemail
      - phone number has an invalid format
      - service error
      - unable to reach the user’s phone
      - unable to send the mobile app notification to the device
      - unable to send the mobile app notification
      - user declined the authentication
      - user did not respond to mobile app notification
      - user does not have any verification methods registered
      - user entered incorrect code
      - user entered incorrect PIN
      - user hung up the phone call without succeeding the authentication
      - user is blocked
      - user never entered the verification code
      - user not found
      - verification code already used once

**MFA authentication method:** The authentication method the user used to complete MFA. Possible values include:

- Text message
- Mobile app notification
- Phone call (Authentication phone)
- Mobile app verification code
- Phone call (Office phone)
- Phone call (Alternate authentication phone)

**MFA authentication detail:** Scrubbed version of the phone number, for example: +X XXXXXXXX64.

**Conditional Access** Find information about Conditional Access policies that affected the sign-in attempt including:

- Policy name
- Grant controls
- Session controls
- Result

## PowerShell reporting on users registered for MFA

First, ensure that you have the [MSOnline V1 PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0) installed.

Identify users who have registered for MFA using the PowerShell that follows.

```Get-MsolUser -All | Where-Object {$_.StrongAuthenticationMethods -ne $null} | Select-Object -Property UserPrincipalName```

Identify users who have not registered for MFA using the PowerShell that follows.

```Get-MsolUser -All | Where-Object {$_.StrongAuthenticationMethods.Count -eq 0} | Select-Object -Property UserPrincipalName```

## Possible results in activity reports

The following table may be used to troubleshoot multi-factor authentication using the downloaded version of the multi-factor authentication activity report. They will not appear directly in the Azure portal.

| Call Result | Description | Broad description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SUCCESS_WITH_PIN | PIN Entered | The user entered a PIN.  If authentication succeeded then they entered the correct PIN.  If authentication is denied, then they entered an incorrect PIN or the user is set to Standard mode. |
| SUCCESS_NO_PIN | Only # Entered | If the user is set to PIN mode and the authentication is denied, this means the user did not enter their PIN and only entered #.  If the user is set to Standard mode and the authentication succeeds this means the user only entered # which is the correct thing to do in Standard mode. |
| SUCCESS_WITH_PIN_BUT_TIMEOUT | # Not Pressed After Entry | The user did not send any DTMF digits since # was not entered.  Other digits entered are not sent unless # is entered indicating the completion of the entry. |
|SUCCESS_NO_PIN_BUT_TIMEOUT | No Phone Input - Timed Out | The call was answered, but there was no response.  This typically indicates the call was picked up by voicemail. |
| SUCCESS_PIN_EXPIRED | PIN Expired and Not Changed | The user's PIN is expired and they were prompted to change it, but the PIN change was not successfully completed. |
| SUCCESS_USED_CACHE | Used Cache | Authentication succeeded without a Multi-Factor Authentication call since a previous successful authentication for the same username occurred within the configured cache timeframe. |
| SUCCESS_BYPASSED_AUTH | Bypassed Auth | Authentication succeeded using a One-Time Bypass initiated for the user.  See the Bypassed User History Report for more details on the bypass. |
| SUCCESS_USED_IP_BASED_CACHE | Used IP-based Cache | Authentication succeeded without a Multi-Factor Authentication call since a previous successful authentication for the same username, authentication type, application name, and IP occurred within the configured cache timeframe. |
| SUCCESS_USED_APP_BASED_CACHE | Used App-based Cache | Authentication succeeded without a Multi-Factor Authentication call since a previous successful authentication for the same username, authentication type, and application name within the configured cache timeframe. |
| SUCCESS_INVALID_INPUT | Invalid Phone Input | The response sent from the phone is not valid.  This could be from a fax machine or modem or the user may have entered * as part of their PIN. |
| SUCCESS_USER_BLOCKED | User is Blocked | The user's phone number is blocked.  A blocked number can be initiated by the user during an authentication call or by an administrator using the Azure portal. <br> NOTE:  A blocked number is also a byproduct of a Fraud Alert. |
| SUCCESS_SMS_AUTHENTICATED | Text Message Authenticated | For two-way test message, the user correctly replied with their one-time passcode (OTP) or OTP + PIN. |
| SUCCESS_SMS_SENT | Text Message Sent | For Text Message, the text message containing the one-time passcode (OTP) was successfully sent.  The user will enter the OTP or OTP + PIN in the application to complete the authentication. |
