# Customize the Azure AD functionality for self-service password reset

IT professionals who want to deploy self-service password reset (SSPR) in Azure Active directory (Azure AD) can customize the experience to match their users' needs.

## Customize the "Contact your administrator" link

Self-service password reset users have a "Contact your administrator" link available to them in the password reset portal. If a user selects this link, it will do one of two things:

* If left in the default state:
   * Email is sent to your administrators and asks them to provide assistance in changing the user's password. See the [sample email](#sample-email) below.
* If customized:
   * Sends your user to a webpage or email address specified by the administrator for assistance.

> [!TIP]
> If you customize this, we recommend setting this to something users are already familiar with for support

> [!WARNING]
> If you customize this setting with an email address and account that needs a password reset the user may be unable to ask for assistance.

### Sample email

![Sample request to reset email sent to Administrator][Contact]

The contact email is sent to the following recipients in the following order:

1. If the **password administrator** role is assigned, administrators with this role are notified.
2. If no password administrators are assigned, then administrators with the **user administrator** role are notified.
3. If neither of the previous roles are assigned, then the **global administrators** are notified.

In all cases, a maximum of 100 recipients are notified.

To find out more about the different administrator roles and how to assign them, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md).

### Disable "Contact your administrator" emails

If your organization does not want to notify administrators about password reset requests, you can enable the following configuration:

* Enable self-service password reset for all end users. This option is under **Password Reset** > **Properties**. If you don't want users to reset their own passwords, you can scope access to an empty group. *We don't recommend this option.*
* Customize the helpdesk link to provide a web URL or mailto: address that users can use to get assistance. This option is under **Password Reset** > **Customization** > **Custom helpdesk email or URL**.

## Customize the AD FS sign-in page for SSPR

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) administrators can add a link to their sign-in page by using the guidance found in the [Add sign-in page description](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/add-sign-in-page-description) article.

To add a link to the AD FS sign-in page, use the following command on your AD FS server. Users can use this page to enter the SSPR workflow.

``` powershell
Set-ADFSGlobalWebContent -SigninPageDescriptionText "<p><A href='https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com' target='_blank'>Can’t access your account?</A></p>"
```

## Customize the sign-in page and access panel look and feel

You can customize the sign-in page. You can add a logo that appears along with the image that fits your company branding.

The graphics you choose are shown in the following circumstances:

* After a user enters their username
* If the user accesses the customized URL:
   * By passing the `whr` parameter to the password reset page, like `https://login.microsoftonline.com/?whr=contoso.com`
   * By passing the `username` parameter to the password reset page, like `https://login.microsoftonline.com/?username=admin@contoso.com`

Find details on how to configure company branding in the article [Add company branding to your sign-in page in Azure AD](../fundamentals/customize-branding.md).

### Directory name

You can change the directory name attribute under **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties**. You can show a friendly organization name that is seen in the portal and in the automated communications. This option is the most visible in automated emails in the forms that follow:

* The friendly name in the email, for example “Microsoft on behalf of CONTOSO demo”
* The subject line in the email, for example “CONTOSO demo account email verification code”
