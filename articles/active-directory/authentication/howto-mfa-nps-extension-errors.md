# Resolve error messages from the NPS extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

If you encounter errors with the NPS extension for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, use this article to reach a resolution faster. NPS extension logs are found in Event Viewer under **Custom Views** > **Server Roles** > **Network Policy and Access Services** on the server where the NPS Extension is installed.

## Troubleshooting steps for common errors

| Error code | Troubleshooting steps |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| **CONTACT_SUPPORT** | [Contact support](#contact-microsoft-support), and mention the list of steps for collecting logs. Provide as much information as you can about what happened before the error, including tenant id, and user principal name (UPN). |
| **CLIENT_CERT_INSTALL_ERROR** | There may be an issue with how the client certificate was installed or associated with your tenant. Follow the instructions in [Troubleshooting the MFA NPS extension](howto-mfa-nps-extension.md#troubleshooting) to investigate client cert problems. |
| **ESTS_TOKEN_ERROR** | Follow the instructions in [Troubleshooting the MFA NPS extension](howto-mfa-nps-extension.md#troubleshooting) to investigate client cert and ADAL token problems. |
| **HTTPS_COMMUNICATION_ERROR** | The NPS server is unable to receive responses from Azure MFA. Verify that your firewalls are open bidirectionally for traffic to and from https://adnotifications.windowsazure.com |
| **HTTP_CONNECT_ERROR** | On the server that runs the NPS extension, verify that you can reach  https://adnotifications.windowsazure.com and https://login.microsoftonline.com/. If those sites don't load, troubleshoot connectivity on that server. |
| **NPS Extension for Azure MFA:** <br> NPS Extension for Azure MFA only performs Secondary Auth for Radius requests in AccessAccept State. Request received for User username with response state AccessReject, ignoring request. | This error usually reflects an authentication failure in AD or that the NPS server is unable to receive responses from Azure AD. Verify that your firewalls are open bidirectionally for traffic to and from https://adnotifications.windowsazure.com and https://login.microsoftonline.com using ports 80 and 443. It is also important to check that on the DIAL-IN tab of Network Access Permissions, the setting is set to "control access through NPS Network Policy". This error can also trigger if the user is not assigned a license. |
| **REGISTRY_CONFIG_ERROR** | A key is missing in the registry for the application, which may be because the [PowerShell script](howto-mfa-nps-extension.md#install-the-nps-extension) wasn't run after installation. The error message should include the missing key. Make sure you have the key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureMfa. |
| **REQUEST_FORMAT_ERROR** <br> Radius Request missing mandatory Radius userName\Identifier attribute.Verify that NPS is receiving RADIUS requests | This error usually reflects an installation issue. The NPS extension must be installed in NPS servers that can receive RADIUS requests. NPS servers that are installed as dependencies for services like RDG and RRAS don't receive radius requests. NPS Extension does not work when installed over such installations and errors out since it cannot read the details from the authentication request. |
| **REQUEST_MISSING_CODE** | Make sure that the password encryption protocol between the NPS and NAS servers supports the secondary authentication method that you're using. **PAP** supports all the authentication methods of Azure MFA in the cloud: phone call, one-way text message, mobile app notification, and mobile app verification code. **CHAPV2** and **EAP** support phone call and mobile app notification. |
| **USERNAME_CANONICALIZATION_ERROR** | Verify that the user is present in your on-premises Active Directory instance, and that the NPS Service has permissions to access the directory. If you are using cross-forest trusts, [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support) for further help. |

### Alternate login ID errors

| Error code | Error message | Troubleshooting steps |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **ALTERNATE_LOGIN_ID_ERROR** | Error: userObjectSid lookup failed | Verify that the user exists in your on-premises Active Directory instance. If you are using cross-forest trusts, [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support) for further help. |
| **ALTERNATE_LOGIN_ID_ERROR** | Error: Alternate LoginId lookup failed | Verify that LDAP_ALTERNATE_LOGINID_ATTRIBUTE is set to a [valid active directory attribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms675090(v=vs.85).aspx). <br><br> If LDAP_FORCE_GLOBAL_CATALOG is set to True, or LDAP_LOOKUP_FORESTS is configured with a non-empty value, verify that you have configured a Global Catalog and that the AlternateLoginId attribute is added to it. <br><br> If LDAP_LOOKUP_FORESTS is configured with a non-empty value, verify that the value is correct. If there is more than one forest name, the names must be separated with semi-colons, not spaces. <br><br> If these steps don't fix the problem, [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support) for more help. |
| **ALTERNATE_LOGIN_ID_ERROR** | Error: Alternate LoginId value is empty | Verify that the AlternateLoginId attribute is configured for the user. |

## Errors your users may encounter

| Error code | Error message | Troubleshooting steps |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **AccessDenied** | Caller tenant does not have access permissions to do authentication for the user | Check whether the tenant domain and the domain of the user principal name (UPN) are the same. For example, make sure that user@contoso.com is trying to authenticate to the Contoso tenant. The UPN represents a valid user for the tenant in Azure. |
| **AuthenticationMethodNotConfigured** | The specified authentication method was not configured for the user | Have the user add or verify their verification methods according to the instructions in [Manage your settings for two-step verification](../user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings.md). |
| **AuthenticationMethodNotSupported** | Specified authentication method is not supported. | Collect all your logs that include this error, and [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support). When you contact support, provide the username and the secondary verification method that triggered the error. |
| **BecAccessDenied** | MSODS Bec call returned access denied, probably the username is not defined in the tenant | The user is present in Active Directory on-premises but is not synced into Azure AD by AD Connect. Or, the user is missing for the tenant. Add the user to Azure AD and have them add their verification methods according to the instructions in [Manage your settings for two-step verification](../user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings.md). |
| **InvalidFormat** or **StrongAuthenticationServiceInvalidParameter** | The phone number is in an unrecognizable format | Have the user correct their verification phone numbers. |
| **InvalidSession** | The specified session is invalid or may have expired | The session has taken more than three minutes to complete. Verify that the user is entering the verification code, or responding to the app notification, within three minutes of initiating the authentication request. If that doesn't fix the problem, check that there are no network latencies between client, NAS Server, NPS Server, and the Azure MFA endpoint.  |
| **NoDefaultAuthenticationMethodIsConfigured** | No default authentication method was configured for the user | Have the user add or verify their verification methods according to the instructions in [Manage your settings for two-step verification](../user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings.md). Verify that the user has chosen a default authentication method, and configured that method for their account. |
| **OathCodePinIncorrect** | Wrong code and pin entered. | This error is not expected in the NPS extension. If your user encounters this, [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support) for troubleshooting help. |
| **ProofDataNotFound** | Proof data was not configured for the specified authentication method. | Have the user try a different verification method, or add a new verification methods according to the instructions in [Manage your settings for two-step verification](../user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings.md). If the user continues to see this error after you confirmed that their verification method is set up correctly, [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support). |
| **SMSAuthFailedWrongCodePinEntered** | Wrong code and pin entered. (OneWaySMS) | This error is not expected in the NPS extension. If your user encounters this, [contact support](#contact-microsoft-support) for troubleshooting help. |
| **TenantIsBlocked** | Tenant is blocked | [Contact support](#contact-microsoft-support) with Directory ID from the Azure AD properties page in the Azure portal. |
| **UserNotFound** | The specified user was not found | The tenant is no longer visible as active in Azure AD. Check that your subscription is active and you have the required first party apps. Also make sure the tenant in the certificate subject is as expected and the cert is still valid and registered under the service principal. |

## Messages your users may encounter that aren't errors

Sometimes, your users may get messages from Multi-Factor Authentication because their authentication request failed. These aren't errors in the product of configuration, but are intentional warnings explaining why an authentication request was denied.

| Error code | Error message | Recommended steps | 
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **OathCodeIncorrect** | Wrong code entered\OATH Code Incorrect | The user entered the wrong code. Have them try again by requesting a new code or signing in again. | 
| **SMSAuthFailedMaxAllowedCodeRetryReached** | Maximum allowed code retry reached | The user failed the verification challenge too many times. Depending on your settings, they may need to be unblocked by an admin now.  |
| **SMSAuthFailedWrongCodeEntered** | Wrong code entered/Text Message OTP Incorrect | The user entered the wrong code. Have them try again by requesting a new code or signing in again. |

## Next steps

### Troubleshoot user accounts

If your users are [Having trouble with two-step verification](../user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-troubleshoot.md), help them self-diagnose problems.

### Health check script

The [Azure MFA NPS Extension health check script](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-MFA-NPS-Extension-648de6bb) is available on the TechNet Gallery to perform a basic health check when troubleshooting the NPS extension. Run the script and choose option 3.

### Contact Microsoft support

If you need additional help, contact a support professional through [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server support](https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?prid=14947). When contacting us, it's helpful if you can include as much information about your issue as possible. Information you can supply includes the page where you saw the error, the specific error code, the specific session ID, the ID of the user who saw the error, and debug logs.

To collect debug logs for support diagnostics, use the following steps on the NPS server:

1. Open Registry Editor and browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureMfa set **VERBOSE_LOG** to **TRUE**
2. Open an Administrator command prompt and run these commands:

   ```
   Mkdir c:\NPS
   Cd NPS
   netsh trace start Scenario=NetConnection capture=yes tracefile=c:\NPS\nettrace.etl
   logman create trace "NPSExtension" -ow -o c:\NPS\NPSExtension.etl -p {7237ED00-E119-430B-AB0F-C63360C8EE81} 0xffffffffffffffff 0xff -nb 16 16 -bs 1024 -mode Circular -f bincirc -max 4096 -ets
   logman update trace "NPSExtension" -p {EC2E6D3A-C958-4C76-8EA4-0262520886FF} 0xffffffffffffffff 0xff -ets
   ```

3. Reproduce the issue

4. Stop the tracing with these commands:

   ```
   logman stop "NPSExtension" -ets
   netsh trace stop
   wevtutil epl AuthNOptCh C:\NPS\%computername%_AuthNOptCh.evtx
   wevtutil epl AuthZOptCh C:\NPS\%computername%_AuthZOptCh.evtx
   wevtutil epl AuthZAdminCh C:\NPS\%computername%_AuthZAdminCh.evtx
   Start .
   ```

5. Open Registry Editor and browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureMfa set **VERBOSE_LOG** to **FALSE**
6. Zip the contents of the C:\NPS folder and attach the zipped file to the support case.
