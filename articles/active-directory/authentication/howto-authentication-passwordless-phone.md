# Enable passwordless sign-in with the Microsoft Authenticator app (preview)

The Microsoft Authenticator app can be used to sign in to any Azure AD account without using a password. Similar to the technology of [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification), the Microsoft Authenticator uses key-based authentication to enable a user credential that is tied to a device and uses a biometric or PIN. This authentication method can be used on any device platform, including mobile, and with any app or website that integrates with Microsoft authentication libraries.

Instead of seeing a prompt for a password after entering a username, a person who has enabled phone sign-in from the Microsoft Authenticator app will see a message telling them to tap a number in their app. In the app, the user must match the number, choose Approve, then provide their PIN or biometric, then the authentication will complete.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability has been in the Microsoft Authenticator app since March of 2017, so there is a possibility that when the policy is enabled for a directory, users may encounter this flow immediately, and see an error message if they have not been enabled by policy. Be aware and prepare your users for this change.

## Prerequisites

- Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, with push notifications allowed as a verification method 
- Latest version of Microsoft Authenticator installed on devices running iOS 8.0 or greater, or Android 6.0 or greater.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enabled the previous Microsoft Authenticator app passwordless sign-in preview using Azure AD PowerShell, it was enabled for your entire directory. If you enable using this new method, it will supercede the PowerShell policy. We recommend enabling for all users in your tenant via the new Authentication Methods, otherwise users not in the new policy will no longer be able to log in passwordlessly. 

## Enable passwordless authentication methods

### Enable the combined registration experience

Registration features for passwordless authentication methods rely on the combined registration feature. Follow the steps in the article [Enable combined security information registration](howto-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md), to enable combined registration.

### Enable passwordless phone sign-in authentication methods

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a **global admin** account.
1. Search for and select *Azure Active Directory*. Select **Security** > **Authentication methods** > **Authentication method policy (Preview)**
1. Under **Passwordless phone sign-in**, choose the following options
   1. **Enable** - Yes or No
   1. **Target** - All users or Select users
1. **Save** to set the new policy

## User registration and management of Microsoft Authenticator app

1. Browse to [https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo](https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo)
1. Sign in if not already
1. Add an authenticator app by clicking **Add method**, choosing **Authenticator app**, and clicking **Add**
1. Follow the instructions to install and configure the Microsoft Authenticator app on your device
1. Click **Done** to complete Authenticator MFA app setup flow. 
1. In **Microsoft Authenticator**, choose **Enable phone sign-in** from the account drop-down menu
1. Follow the instructions in the app to finish registering for passwordless phone sign-in. 

Organizations can point their users to the article [Sign in with your phone, not your password](../user-help/user-help-auth-app-sign-in.md) for further assistance setting up in the Microsoft Authenticator app and enabling phone sign-in. In order to apply these settings, you may need to log out and log back into the tenant. 

## Sign in with passwordless credential

For public preview, there is no way to enforce users to create or use this new credential. A user will only encounter passwordless sign-in once an admin has enabled their tenant **and** the user has updated their Microsoft Authenticator app to enable phone sign-in.

After typing your username on the web and selecting **Next**, users are presented with a number and are prompted in their Microsoft Authenticator app to select the appropriate number to authenticate instead of using their password.

## Known Issues

### User is not enabled by policy but still has passwordless phone sign-in method in Microsoft Authenticator

It is possible that a user has at some point created a passwordless phone sign-in credential in their current Microsoft Authenticator app, or on an earlier device. Once an admin enables the authentication method policy for passwordless phone sign-in, any user with a credential registered, will start to experience the new sign-in prompt, regardless of whether they have been enabled to use the policy or not. If the user has not been allowed to use the credential by policy, they will see an error after completing the authentication flow. 

The admin can choose to enable the user to use passwordless phone sign-in, or the user must remove the method. If the user no longer has the registered device, they can go to [https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo](https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo) and remove it. If they are still using the Authenticator for MFA, they can choose **Disable phone sign-in** from within the Microsoft Authenticator.  

### AD FS integration

When a user has enabled the Microsoft Authenticator passwordless credential, authentication for that user will always default to sending a notification for approval. This logic prevents users in a hybrid tenant from being directed to AD FS for sign-in verification without the user taking an additional step to click "Use your password instead." This process will also bypass any on-premises Conditional Access policies, and Pass-through authentication flows. 

If a user has an unanswered passwordless phone sign-in verification pending and attempts to sign in again, the user may be taken to AD FS to enter a password instead.  

### Azure MFA server

End users who are enabled for MFA through an organization's on-premises Azure MFA server can still create and use a single passwordless phone sign in credential. If the user attempts to upgrade multiple installations (5+) of the Microsoft Authenticator with the credential, this change may result in an error.  

### Device registration

One of the prerequisites to create this new strong credential, is that the device, where the Microsoft Authenticator app is installed, must also be registered within the Azure AD tenant to an individual user. Due to current device registration restrictions, a device can only be registered in a single tenant. This limit means that only one work or school account in the Microsoft Authenticator app can be enabled for phone sign-in.

### Intune mobile application management 

End users who are subject to a policy that requires mobile application management (MAM) can't register the passwordless credential in the Microsoft Authenticator app. 

> [!NOTE]
> Device registration is not the same as device management or "MDM." It only associates a device ID and a user ID together in the Azure AD directory.
