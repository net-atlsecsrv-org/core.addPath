# Sign up your organization to use Azure Active Directory
Sign up for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or a new Microsoft Azure subscription, using either:

- **Microsoft account.** Use your personal Microsoft account to get access to Azure and all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox LIVE, or Microsoft 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. For more information, see [Microsoft account overview](https://account.microsoft.com/account).

- **Work or school account.** Use your work or school-related account to get access to all the small, medium, and enterprise cloud services from Microsoft, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. After you sign up for one of these services as an organization, Azure AD automatically provisions a cloud-based directory that represents your organization. For more information, see [Manage your Azure AD directory](./active-directory-whatis.md).

  > [!Note]
  >   We recommend that you use your work or school account if you already have access to Azure AD. However, you should use whichever type of account is associated with your Azure subscription.
