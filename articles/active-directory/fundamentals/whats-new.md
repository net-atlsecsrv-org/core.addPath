## February 2021

### Email one-time passcode authentication on by default starting October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

Starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode authentication](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios. At this time, Microsoft will no longer allow the redemption of invitations using unmanaged Azure Active Directory accounts. 

---

### Unrequested but consented permissions will no longer be added to tokens if they would trigger Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform
 
Currently, applications using [dynamic permissions](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-individual-user-consent) are given all of the permissions they're consented to access. This includes applications that are unrequested and even if they trigger conditional access. For example, this can cause an app requesting only `user.read` that also has consent for `files.read`, to be forced to pass the Conditional Access assigned for the `files.read` permission. 

To reduce the number of unnecessary Conditional Access prompts, Azure AD is changing the way that unrequested scopes are provided to applications. Apps will only trigger conditional access for permission they explicitly request. For more information, read [What's new in authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#conditional-access-will-only-trigger-for-explicitly-requested-scopes).

Temporary Access Pass is a time-limited passcode that serves as strong credentials and allows onboarding of Passwordless credentials and recovery when a user has lost or forgotten their strong authentication factor (for example, FIDO2 security key or Microsoft Authenticator) app and needs to sign in to register new strong authentication methods. [Learn more](../authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md).

---

### General Availability - Domain Name Administrator built-in role

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC  
**Product capability:** Access Control
 
Users with this role can manage (read, add, verify, update, and delete) domain names. They can also read directory information about users, groups, and applications, as these objects have domain dependencies. 

For on-premises environments, users with this role can configure domain names for federation so that associated users are always authenticated on-premises. These users can then sign into Azure AD-based services with their on-premises passwords via single sign-on. Federation settings need to be synced via Azure AD Connect, so users also have permissions to manage Azure AD Connect. [Learn more](../roles/permissions-reference.md#domain-name-administrator).

### Azure AD On-Premises Hybrid Agents Impacted by Azure TLS Certificate Changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Microsoft is updating Azure services to use TLS certificates from a different set of Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). This update is due to the current CA certificates not complying with one of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements. This change will impact Azure AD hybrid agents installed on-premises that have hardened environments with a fixed list of root certificates and will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises, [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords, and [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that perform AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you will need to allow the following CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

Activity by the SCIM [provisioning service](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) is logged in both the audit logs and provisioning logs. This includes activity such as the creation of a user in ServiceNow, group in GSuite, or import of a role from AWS. In the future, these events will only be published in the provisioning logs. This change is being implemented to avoid duplicate events across logs, and additional costs incurred by customers consuming the logs in log analytics. 

We'll provide an update when a date is completed. This deprecation isn't planned for the calendar year 2020. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact any events in the audit logs outside of the synchronization events emitted by the provisioning service. Events such as the creation of an application, conditional access policy, a user in the directory, etc. will continue to be emitted in the audit logs. [Learn more](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fapp-provisioning%2fcontext%2fapp-provisioning-context).

### Renaming 10 Azure Active Directory roles

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Azure roles  
**Product capability:** Access Control
 
Some Azure Active Directory (AD) built-in roles have names that differ from those that appear in Microsoft 365 admin center, the Azure AD portal, and Microsoft Graph. This inconsistency can cause problems in automated processes. With this update, we're renaming 10 role names to make them consistent. The following table has the new role names:

### Azure AD B2C support for auth code flow for SPAs using MSAL JS 2.x

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
MSAL.js version 2.x now includes support for the authorization code flow for single-page web apps (SPAs).

### Updates to Remember Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on a trusted device setting

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We've recently updated the [remember Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](../authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#remember-multi-factor-authentication) on a trusted device feature to extend authentication for up to 365 days. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium licenses, can also use the [Conditional Access – Sign-in Frequency policy](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md#user-sign-in-frequency) that provides more flexibility for reauthentication settings.

For the optimal user experience, we recommend using Conditional Access sign-in frequency to extend session lifetimes on trusted devices, locations, or low-risk sessions as an alternative to the remember MFA on a trusted device setting. To get started, review our [latest guidance on optimizing the reauthentication experience](../authentication/concepts-azure-multi-factor-authentication-prompts-session-lifetime.md).

### Cloud Provisioning Public Preview Refresh

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning 
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Azure AD Connect Cloud Provisioning public preview refresh features two major enhancements developed from customer feedback: 

- Attribute Mapping Experience through Azure portal

    With this feature, IT Admins can map user, group, or contact attributes from AD to Azure AD using various mapping types present today. Attribute mapping is a feature used for standardizing the values of the attributes that flow from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory. One can determine whether to directly map the attribute value as it is from AD to Azure AD or use expressions to transform the attribute values when provisioning users. [Learn more](../cloud-sync/how-to-attribute-mapping.md)

- On-demand Provisioning or Test User experience

    Once you have setup your configuration, you might want to test to see if the user transformation is working as expected before applying it to all your users in scope. With on-demand provisioning, IT Admins can enter the Distinguished Name (DN) of an AD user and see if they're getting synced as expected. On-demand provisioning provides a great way to ensure that the attribute mappings you did previously work as expected. [Learn More](../cloud-sync/how-to-on-demand-provision.md)

### New delegation role in Azure AD entitlement management: Access package assignment manager

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 
A new Access Package Assignment Manager role has been added in Azure AD entitlement management to provide granular permissions to manage assignments. You can now delegate tasks to a user in this role, who can delegate assignments management of an access package to a business owner. However, an Access Package Assignment Manager can't alter the access package policies or other properties that are set by the administrators. 

With this new role, you benefit from the least privileges needed to delegate management of assignments and maintain administrative control on all other access package configurations. To learn more, see [Entitlement management roles](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md#entitlement-management-roles).

### Changes to Privileged Identity Management's onboarding flow

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Previously, onboarding to Privileged Identity Management (PIM) required user consent and an onboarding flow in PIM's blade that included enrollment in Azure AD MFA. With the recent integration of PIM experience into the Azure AD roles and administrators blade, we are removing this experience. Any tenant with valid P2 license will be auto-onboarded to PIM.

Onboarding to PIM does not have any direct adverse effect on your tenant. You can expect the following changes:
- Additional assignment options such as active vs. eligible with start and end time when you make an assignment in either PIM or Azure AD roles and administrators blade. 
- Additional scoping mechanisms, like Administrative Units and custom roles, introduced directly into the assignment experience. 
- If you are a global administrator or privileged role administrator, you may start getting a few additional emails like the PIM weekly digest. 
- You might also see ms-pim service principal in the audit log related to role assignment. This expected change shouldn't affect your regular workflow.

 For more information, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md).

### Azure AD Entitlement Management: The Select pane of access package resources now shows by default the resources currently in the selected catalog

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 

In the access package creation flow, under the Resource roles tab, the Select pane behavior is changing. Currently, the default behavior is to show all resources that are owned by the user and resources added to the selected catalog. 

This experience will be changed to display only the resources currently added in the catalog by default, so that users can easily pick resources from the catalog. The update will help with discoverability of the resources to add to access packages, and reduce risk of inadvertently adding resources owned by the user that aren't part of the catalog. To learn more, see [Create a new access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles).
