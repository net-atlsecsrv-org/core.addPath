## March 2020

### Unmanaged Azure Active Directory accounts in B2B update for March, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
**Beginning on March 31, 2021**, Microsoft will no longer support the redemption of invitations by creating unmanaged Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios. In preparation for this, we encourage you to opt in to [email one-time passcode authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/one-time-passcode).

### Users with the default access role will be in scope for provisioning

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Historically, users with the default access role have been out of scope for provisioning. We've heard feedback that customers want users with this role to be in scope for provisioning. We're working on deploying a change so that all new provisioning configurations will allow users with the default access role to be provisioned. Gradually, we'll change the behavior for existing provisioning configurations to support provisioning users with this role. No customer action is required. We'll post an update to our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-no-users-provisioned) once this change is in place.

### HomeRealmDiscovery policy changes will appear in the audit logs

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Audit  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
We fixed a bug where changes to the [HomeRealmDiscovery policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-authentication-for-federated-users-portal) were not included in the audit logs. You will now be able to see when and how the policy was changed, and by whom.

### Disaster recovery: Download and store your provisioning configuration

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The Azure AD provisioning service provides a rich set of configuration capabilities. Customers need to be able to save their configuration so that they can refer to it later or roll back to a known good version. We've added the ability to download your provisioning configuration as a JSON file and upload it when you need it. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/export-import-provisioning-configuration).

### SSPR (self-service password reset) now requires two gates for admins in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Self-Service Password Reset  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
Previously in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet), admins using self-service password reset (SSPR) to reset their own passwords needed only one "gate" (challenge) to prove their identity. In public and other national clouds, admins generally must use two gates to prove their identity when using SSPR. But because we didn't support SMS or phone calls in Azure China 21Vianet, we allowed one-gate password reset by admins.

We're creating SSPR feature parity between Azure China 21Vianet and the public cloud. Going forward, admins must use two gates when using SSPR. SMS, phone calls, and Authenticator app notifications and codes will be supported. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy#administrator-reset-policy-differences).

### Password length is limited to 256 characters

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
To ensure the reliability of the Azure AD service, user passwords are now limited in length to 256 characters. Users with passwords longer than this will be asked to change their password on subsequent login, either by contacting their admin or by using the self-service password reset feature.

This change was enabled on March 13th, 2020, at 10AM PST (18:00 UTC), and the error is AADSTS 50052, InvalidPasswordExceedsMaxLength. See the [breaking change notice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#user-passwords-will-be-restricted-to-256-characters) for more details.

---

### Azure AD sign-in logs are now available for all free tenants through the Azure portal

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Starting now, customers who have free tenants can access the [Azure AD sign-in logs from the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins) for up to 7 days. Previously, sign-in logs were available only for customers with Azure Active Directory Premium licenses. With this change, all tenants can access these logs through the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers still need a premium license (Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or P2) to access the sign-in logs through Microsoft Graph API and Azure Monitor.

---

### Deprecation of Directory-wide groups option from Groups General Settings on Azure portal

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

To provide a more flexible way for customers to create directory-wide groups that best meet their needs, we've replaced the **Directory-wide Groups** option from the **Groups** > **General** settings in the Azure portal with a link to [dynamic group documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership). We've improved our documentation to include more instructions so administrators can create all-user groups that include or exclude guest users.

---

## February 2020

### Upcoming changes to custom controls

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
We're planning to replace the current custom controls preview with an approach that allows partner-provided authentication capabilities to work seamlessly with the Azure Active Directory administrator and end user experiences. Today, partner MFA solutions face the following limitations: they work only after a password has been entered; they don't serve as MFA for step-up authentication in other key scenarios; and they don't integrate with end user or administrative credential management functions. The new implementation will allow partner-provided authentication factors to work alongside built-in factors for key scenarios, including registration, usage, MFA claims, step up authentication, reporting, and logging. 

Custom controls will continue to be supported in preview alongside the new design until it reaches general availability. At that point, we'll give customers time to migrate to the new design. Because of the limitations of the current approach, we won't onboard new providers until the new design is available. We are working closely with customers and providers and will communicate the timeline as we get closer. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696#).

### Identity Secure Score - MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score is removing three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication (MFA), and adding two.

The following improvement actions will be removed:

- Register all users for MFA
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

The following improvement actions will be added:

- Ensure all users can complete MFA for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions will require registering your users or admins for MFA across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. This can take the form of setting security defaults that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA, or having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions. As part of these improvement action updates, Baseline protection policies will no longer be included in scoring calculations. [Read more about what's coming in Microsoft Secure Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score-whats-coming?view=o365-worldwide).

### Azure AD Domain Services SKU selection

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services
 
We've heard feedback that Azure AD Domain Services customers want more flexibility in selecting performance levels for their instances. Starting on February 1, 2020, we switched from a dynamic model (where Azure AD determines the performance and pricing tier based on object count) to a self-selection model. Now customers can choose a performance tier that matches their environment. This change also allows us to enable new scenarios like Resource Forests, and Premium features like daily backups. The object count is now unlimited for all SKUs, but we'll continue to offer object count suggestions for each tier.

**No immediate customer action is required.** For existing customers, the dynamic tier that was in use on February 1, 2020, determines the new default tier. There is no pricing or performance impact as the result of this change. Going forward, Azure AD DS customers will need to evaluate performance requirements as their directory size and workload characteristics change. Switching between service tiers will continue to be a no-downtime operation, and we will no longer automatically move customers to new tiers based on the growth of their directory. Furthermore, there will be no price increases, and new pricing will align with our current billing model. For more information, see the [Azure AD DS SKUs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/administration-concepts#azure-ad-ds-skus) and the [Azure AD Domain Services pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/).

### Breaking Change: URI Fragments will not be carried through the login redirect

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting on February 8, 2020, when a request is sent to login.microsoftonline.com to sign in a user, the service will append an empty fragment to the request.  This prevents a class of redirect attacks by ensuring that the browser wipes out any existing fragment in the request. No application should have a dependency on this behavior. For more information, see [Breaking changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#february-2020) in the Microsoft identity platform documentation.

### Replacement of baseline policies with security defaults

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Identity Security and Protection

As part of a secure-by-default model for authentication, we're removing the existing baseline protection policies from all tenants. This removal is targeted for completion at the end of February. The replacement for these baseline protection policies is security defaults. If you've been using baseline protection policies, you must plan to move to the new security defaults policy or to Conditional Access. If you haven't used these policies, there is no action for you to take.

For more information about the new security defaults, see [What are security defaults?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) For more information about Conditional Access policies, see [Common Conditional Access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common).

## November 2019

### Support for the SameSite attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

As part of a secure-by-default model for cookies, the Chrome 80 browser is changing how it treats cookies without the `SameSite` attribute. Any cookie that doesn't specify the `SameSite` attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`, which will result in Chrome blocking certain cross-domain cookie sharing scenarios that your app may depend on. To maintain the older Chrome behavior, you can use the `SameSite=None` attribute and add an additional `Secure` attribute, so cross-site cookies can only be accessed over HTTPS connections. Chrome is scheduled to complete this change by February 4, 2020.

We recommend all our developers test their apps using this guidance:

- Set the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Set the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

- Add an additional `SameSite` attribute of **Secure**.

For more information, see [Upcoming SameSite Cookie Changes in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/upcoming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-asp-net-and-asp-net-core/) and [Potential disruption to customer websites and Microsoft products and services in Chrome version 79 and later](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4522904/potential-disruption-to-microsoft-services-in-chrome-beta-version-79).

### Application Proxy support for the SameSite Attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

A couple of weeks prior to the Chrome 80 browser release, we plan to update how Application Proxy cookies treat the **SameSite** attribute. With the release of Chrome 80, any cookie that doesn't specify the **SameSite** attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`.

To help avoid potentially negative impacts due to this change, we're updating Application Proxy access and session cookies by:

- Setting the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Setting the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Application Proxy access cookies have always been transmitted exclusively over secure channels. These changes only apply to session cookies.

For more information about the Application Proxy cookie settings, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings).

### Office 365 groups expiration policy enhanced with autorenewal

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

The Office 365 groups expiration policy has been enhanced to automatically renew groups that are actively in use by its members. Groups will be autorenewed based on user activity across all the Office 365 apps, including Outlook, SharePoint, and Teams.

This enhancement helps to reduce your group expiration notifications and helps to make sure that active groups continue to be available. If you already have an active expiration policy for your Office 365 groups, you don't need to do anything to turn on this new functionality.

For more information, see [Configure the expiration policy for Office 365 groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-lifecycle).
