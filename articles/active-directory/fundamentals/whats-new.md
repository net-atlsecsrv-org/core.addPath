## February 2020
 
### Identity Secure Score - MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score is removing three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication (MFA), and adding two.

The following improvement actions will be removed:

- Register all users for MFA
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

The following improvement actions will be added:

- Ensure all users can complete MFA for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions will require registering your users or admins for MFA across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. This can take the form of setting security defaults that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA, or having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions. As part of these improvement action updates, Baseline protection policies will no longer be included in scoring calculations. [Read more about what's coming in Microsoft Secure Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score-whats-coming?view=o365-worldwide).

### Azure AD Domain Services SKU selection

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services
 
We’ve heard feedback that Azure AD Domain Services customers want more flexibility in selecting performance levels for their instances. Starting on February 1, 2020, we switched from a dynamic model (where Azure AD determines the performance and pricing tier based on object count) to a self-selection model. Now customers can choose a performance tier that matches their environment. This change also allows us to enable new scenarios like Resource Forests, and Premium features like daily backups. The object count is now unlimited for all SKUs, but we’ll continue to offer object count suggestions for each tier.

**No immediate customer action is required.** For existing customers, the dynamic tier that was in use on February 1, 2020, determines the new default tier. There is no pricing or performance impact as the result of this change. Going forward, Azure AD DS customers will need to evaluate performance requirements as their directory size and workload characteristics change. Switching between service tiers will continue to be a no-downtime operation, and we will no longer automatically move customers to new tiers based on the growth of their directory. Furthermore, there will be no price increases, and new pricing will align with our current billing model. For more information, see the [Azure AD DS SKUs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/administration-concepts#azure-ad-ds-skus) and the [Azure AD Domain Services pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/).

### Breaking Change: URI Fragments will not be carried through the login redirect

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting on February 8, 2020, when a request is sent to login.microsoftonline.com to sign in a user, the service will append an empty fragment to the request.

### Replacement of baseline policies with security defaults

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Identity Security and Protection

As part of a secure-by-default model for authentication, we’re removing the existing baseline protection policies from all tenants. This removal is targeted for completion at the end of February. The replacement for these baseline protection policies is security defaults. If you’ve been using baseline protection policies, you must plan to move to the new security defaults policy or to Conditional Access. If you haven’t used these policies, there is no action for you to take.

For more information about the new security defaults, see [What are security defaults?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) For more information about Conditional Access policies, see [Common Conditional Access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common).

## November 2019

### Support for the SameSite attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

As part of a secure-by-default model for cookies, the Chrome 80 browser is changing how it treats cookies without the `SameSite` attribute. Any cookie that doesn't specify the `SameSite` attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`, which will result in Chrome blocking certain cross-domain cookie sharing scenarios that your app may depend on. To maintain the older Chrome behavior, you can use the `SameSite=None` attribute and add an additional `Secure` attribute, so cross-site cookies can only be accessed over HTTPS connections. Chrome is scheduled to complete this change by February 4, 2020.

We recommend all our developers test their apps using this guidance:

- Set the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Set the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

- Add an additional `SameSite` attribute of **Secure**.

For more information, see [Upcoming SameSite Cookie Changes in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/upcoming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-asp-net-and-asp-net-core/) and [Potential disruption to customer websites and Microsoft products and services in Chrome version 79 and later](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4522904/potential-disruption-to-microsoft-services-in-chrome-beta-version-79).

### New two-stage approval workflow in Azure AD entitlement management (Public Preview)

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management

We've introduced a new two-stage approval workflow that allows you to require two approvers to approve a user's request to an access package.

**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

In response to developer feedback, Azure AD Premium P2 subscribers can now perform complex queries on Azure AD Identity Protection’s risk detection data by using the new riskDetection API for Microsoft Graph.

### Application Proxy support for the SameSite Attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

A couple of weeks prior to the Chrome 80 browser release, we plan to update how Application Proxy cookies treat the **SameSite** attribute. With the release of Chrome 80, any cookie that doesn't specify the **SameSite** attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`.

To help avoid potentially negative impacts due to this change, we're updating Application Proxy access and session cookies by:

- Setting the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Setting the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Application Proxy access cookies have always been transmitted exclusively over secure channels. These changes only apply to session cookies.

For more information about the Application Proxy cookie settings, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings).

### New Azure AD Global Reader role

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC  
**Product capability:** Access Control

Starting on September 24, 2019, we're going to start rolling out a new Azure Active Directory (AD) role called Global Reader. This rollout will start with production and Global cloud customers (GCC), finishing up worldwide in October.

The Global Reader role is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services, but can't take management actions. We’ve created the Global Reader role to help reduce the number of Global Administrators in your organization. Because Global Administrator accounts are powerful and vulnerable to attack, we recommend that you have fewer than five Global Administrators. We recommend using the Global Reader role for planning, audits, or investigations. We also recommend using the Global Reader role in combination with other limited administrator roles, like Exchange Administrator, to help get work done without requiring the Global Administrator role.

The Global Reader role works with the new Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Exchange Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, Security Center, Compliance Center, Azure AD Admin Center, and the Device Management Admin Center.

>[!NOTE]
> At the start of public preview, the Global Reader role won't work with: SharePoint, Privileged Access Management, Customer Lockbox, sensitivity labels, Teams Lifecycle, Teams Reporting & Call Analytics, Teams IP Phone Device Management, and Teams App Catalog. All of these services are intended to work with the role in the future.

For more information, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles).
