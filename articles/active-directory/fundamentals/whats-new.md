## October 2020

### Azure AD On-Premises Hybrid Agents Impacted by Azure TLS Certificate Changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Microsoft is updating Azure services to use TLS certificates from a different set of Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). This update is due to the current CA certificates not complying with one of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements. This change will impact Azure AD hybrid agents installed on-premises that have hardened environments with a fixed list of root certificates and will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises, [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords, and [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that perform AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you will need to allow the following CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

### Provisioning events will be removed from audit logs and published solely to provisioning logs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Activity by the SCIM [provisioning service](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) is logged in both the audit logs and provisioning logs. This includes activity such as the creation of a user in ServiceNow, group in GSuite, or import of a role from AWS. In the future, these events will only be published in the provisioning logs. This change is being implemented to avoid duplicate events across logs, and additional costs incurred by customers consuming the logs in log analytics. 

We'll provide an update when a date is completed. This deprecation isn't planned for the calendar year 2020. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact any events in the audit logs outside of the synchronization events emitted by the provisioning service. Events such as the creation of an application, conditional access policy, a user in the directory, etc. will continue to be emitted in the audit logs. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs?context=azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/context/app-provisioning-context).

### Cloud Provisioning Public Preview Refresh

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning 
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Azure AD Connect Cloud Provisioning public preview refresh features two major enhancements developed from customer feedback: 

- Attribute Mapping Experience through Azure portal

    With this feature, IT Admins can map user, group, or contact attributes from AD to Azure AD using various mapping types present today. Attribute mapping is a feature used for standardizing the values of the attributes that flow from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory. One can determine whether to directly map the attribute value as it is from AD to Azure AD or use expressions to transform the attribute values when provisioning users. [Learn more](../cloud-provisioning/how-to-attribute-mapping.md)

- On-demand Provisioning or Test User experience

    Once you have setup your configuration, you might want to test to see if the user transformation is working as expected before applying it to all your users in scope. With on-demand provisioning, IT Admins can enter the Distinguished Name (DN) of an AD user and see if they are getting synced as expected. On-demand provisioning provides a great way to ensure that the attribute mappings you did previously work as expected. [Learn More](../cloud-provisioning/how-to-on-demand-provision.md)

### New delegation role in Azure AD entitlement management: Access package assignment manager

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 
A new Access Package Assignment Manager role has been added in Azure AD entitlement management to provide granular permissions to manage assignments. You can now delegate tasks to a user in this role, who can delegate assignments management of an access package to a business owner. However, an Access Package Assignment Manager can't alter the access package policies or other properties that are set by the administrators. 

With this new role, you benefit from the least privileges needed to delegate management of assignments and maintain administrative control on all other access package configurations. To learn more, see [Entitlement management roles](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md#entitlement-management-roles).
 
---

### Changes to Privileged Identity Management's onboarding flow

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Previously, onboarding to Privileged Identity Management (PIM) required user consent and an onboarding flow in PIM's blade that included enrollment in Azure MFA. With the recent integration of PIM experience into the Azure AD roles and administrators blade, we are removing this experience. Any tenant with valid P2 license will be auto-onboarded to PIM.

Onboarding to PIM does not have any direct adverse effect on your tenant. You can expect the following changes:
- Additional assignment options such as active vs. eligible with start and end time when you make an assignment in either PIM or Azure AD roles and administrators blade. 
- Additional scoping mechanisms, like Administrative Units and custom roles, introduced directly into the assignment experience. 
- If you are a global administrator or privileged role administrator, you may start getting a few additional emails like the PIM weekly digest. 
- You might also see ms-pim service principal in the audit log related to role assignment. This expected change shouldn't affect your regular workflow.

### Azure AD Entitlement Management: The Select pane of access package resources now shows by default the resources currently in the selected catalog

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 

In the access package creation flow, under the Resource roles tab, the Select pane behavior is changing. Currently, the default behavior is to show all resources that are owned by the user and resources added to the selected catalog. 

This experience will be changed to display only the resources currently added in the catalog by default, so that users can easily pick resources from the catalog. The update will help with discoverability of the resources to add to access packages, and reduce risk of inadvertently adding resources owned by the user that aren't part of the catalog. To learn more, see [Create a new access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles).

## May 2020

### Retirement of properties in signIns, riskyUsers, and riskDetections APIs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Currently, enumerated types are used to represent the riskType property in both the riskDetections API and riskyUserHistoryItem (in preview). Enumerated types are also used for the riskEventTypes property in the signIns API. Going forward we will represent these properties as strings. 

Customers should transition to the riskEventType property in the beta riskDetections and riskyUserHistoryItem API, and to riskEventTypes_v2 property in the beta signIns API by September 9th, 2020. At that date, we will be retiring the current riskType and riskEventTypes properties. For more information, refer to [Changes to risk event properties and Identity Protection APIs on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/changes-to-risk-event-properties-and-identity-protection-apis-on-microsoft-graph/).

### Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Enumerated types will switch to string types when representing risk event properties in Microsoft Graph September 2020. In addition to impacting the preview APIs, this change will also impact the in-production signIns API.

We have introduced a new riskEventsTypes_v2 (string) property to the signIns v1.0 API. We will retire the current riskEventTypes (enum) property on June 11, 2022 in accordance with our Microsoft Graph deprecation policy. Customers should transition to the riskEventTypes_v2 property in the v1.0  signIns API by June 11, 2022. For more information, refer to [Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/deprecation-of-riskeventtypes-property-in-signins-v1-0-api-on-microsoft-graph//).

### Upcoming changes to MFA email notifications

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We are making the following changes to the email notifications for cloud MFA:

### New self-service sign up for users in federated domains who can't access Microsoft Teams because they aren't synced to Azure Active Directory.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 

Currently, users who are in domains federated in Azure AD, but who are not synced into the tenant, can't access Teams. Starting at the end of June, this new capability will enable them to do so by extending the existing email verified sign up feature. This will allow users who can sign in to a federated IdP, but who don't yet have a user object in Azure ID, to have a user object created automatically and be authenticated for Teams. Their user object will be marked as "self-service sign up." This is an extension of the existing capability to do email verified self-sign up that users in managed domains can do and can be controlled using the same flag. This change will complete rolling out during the following two months. Watch for documentation updates [here](../enterprise-users/directory-self-service-signup.md).
 
---

### Upcoming fix: The OIDC discovery document for the Azure Government cloud is being updated to reference the correct Graph endpoints.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting in June, the OIDC discovery document [Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocol](../develop/v2-protocols-oidc.md) on the [Azure Government cloud](../develop/authentication-national-cloud.md) endpoint (login.microsoftonline.us), will begin to return the correct [National cloud graph](/graph/deployments) endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.us or https://dod-graph.microsoft.us), based on the tenant provided.  It currently provides the incorrect Graph endpoint (graph.microsoft.com) "msgraph_host" field.  

This bug fix will be rolled out gradually over approximately 2 months.  

---

### Azure Government users will no longer be able to sign in on login.microsoftonline.com

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
On 1 June 2018, the official Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authority for Azure Government changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us. If you own an application within an Azure Government tenant, you must update your application to sign users in on the .us endpoint.

Starting May 5th, Azure AD will begin enforcing the endpoint change, blocking Azure Government users from signing into apps hosted in Azure Government tenants using the public endpoint (microsoftonline.com). Impacted apps will begin seeing an error AADSTS900439 - USGClientNotSupportedOnPublicEndpoint. 

There will be a gradual rollout of this change with enforcement expected to be complete across all apps June 2020. For more details, please see the [Azure Government blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-government-aad-authority-endpoint-update/).

### SAML Single Logout request now sends NameID in the correct format

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
When a user clicks on sign-out (e.g., in the MyApps portal), Azure AD sends a SAML Single Logout message to each app that is active in the user session and has a Logout URL configured. These messages contain a NameID in a persistent format.

If the original SAML sign-in token used a different format for NameID (e.g. email/UPN), then the SAML app cannot correlate the NameID in the logout message to an existing session (as the NameIDs used in both messages are different), which caused the logout message to be discarded by the SAML app and the user to stay logged in. This fix makes the sign-out message consistent with the NameID configured for the application.

---

### Hybrid Identity Administrator role is now available with Cloud Provisioning

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

### The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available

**Type:** Changed Feature   
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available. 

Previously, you had to manage your B2C consumer-facing applications separately from the rest of your apps using the legacy 'Applications' experience. That meant different app creation experiences across different places in Azure.

The new experience shows all B2C app registrations and Azure AD app registrations in one place and provides a consistent way to manage them. Whether you need to manage a customer-facing app or an app that has access to Microsoft Graph to programmatically manage Azure AD B2C resources, you only need to learn one way to do things.

You can reach the new experience by navigating the Azure AD B2C service and selecting the App registrations blade. The experience is also accessible from the Azure Active Directory service.

The Azure AD B2C App registrations experience is based on the general [App Registration experience](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/new-app-registrations-experience-is-now-generally-available/) for Azure AD tenants but is tailored for Azure AD B2C. The legacy "Applications" experience will be deprecated in the future.

For more information, visit [The New app registration experience for Azure AD B2C](../../active-directory-b2c/app-registrations-training-guide.md).
