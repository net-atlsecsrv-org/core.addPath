## February 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

Starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode authentication](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios.

---

### Unrequested but consented permissions will no longer be added to tokens if they would trigger Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform
 
Currently, applications using [dynamic permissions](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-individual-user-consent) are given all of the permissions they're consented to access. This includes applications that are unrequested and even if they trigger conditional access. For example, this can cause an app requesting only `user.read` that also has consent for `files.read`, to be forced to pass the Conditional Access assigned for the `files.read` permission. 

To reduce the number of unnecessary Conditional Access prompts, Azure AD is changing the way that unrequested scopes are provided to applications. Apps will only trigger conditional access for permission they explicitly request. For more information, read [What's new in authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#conditional-access-will-only-trigger-for-explicitly-requested-scopes).
 
---

---

### Public preview - External Identities Self-Service Sign-up in AAD using MSA accounts

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** B2B

**Service category:** RBAC  
**Product capability:** Access Control
 
Users with this role can manage (read, add, verify, update, and delete) domain names. They can also read directory information about users, groups, and applications, as these objects have domain dependencies. 

For on-premises environments, users with this role can configure domain names for federation so that associated users are always authenticated on-premises. These users can then sign into Azure AD-based services with their on-premises passwords via single sign-on. Federation settings need to be synced via Azure AD Connect, so users also have permissions to manage Azure AD Connect. [Learn more](../roles/permissions-reference.md#domain-name-administrator).

## October 2020

### Azure AD On-Premises Hybrid Agents Impacted by Azure TLS Certificate Changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Microsoft is updating Azure services to use TLS certificates from a different set of Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). This update is due to the current CA certificates not complying with one of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements. This change will impact Azure AD hybrid agents installed on-premises that have hardened environments with a fixed list of root certificates and will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises, [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords, and [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that perform AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you will need to allow the following CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

### Provisioning events will be removed from audit logs and published solely to provisioning logs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Activity by the SCIM [provisioning service](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) is logged in both the audit logs and provisioning logs. This includes activity such as the creation of a user in ServiceNow, group in GSuite, or import of a role from AWS. In the future, these events will only be published in the provisioning logs. This change is being implemented to avoid duplicate events across logs, and additional costs incurred by customers consuming the logs in log analytics. 

We'll provide an update when a date is completed. This deprecation isn't planned for the calendar year 2020. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact any events in the audit logs outside of the synchronization events emitted by the provisioning service. Events such as the creation of an application, conditional access policy, a user in the directory, etc. will continue to be emitted in the audit logs. [Learn more](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fapp-provisioning%2fcontext%2fapp-provisioning-context).

These agents will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include: 
- [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises 
- [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords
- [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that do AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you'll need to allow CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

### Renaming 10 Azure Active Directory roles

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Azure roles  
**Product capability:** Access Control
 
Some Azure Active Directory (AD) built-in roles have names that differ from those that appear in Microsoft 365 admin center, the Azure AD portal, and Microsoft Graph.

### Updates to Remember Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on a trusted device setting

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We've recently updated the [remember Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](../authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#remember-multi-factor-authentication) on a trusted device feature to extend authentication for up to 365 days. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium licenses, can also use the [Conditional Access â€“ Sign-in Frequency policy](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md#user-sign-in-frequency) that provides more flexibility for reauthentication settings.

For the optimal user experience, we recommend using Conditional Access sign-in frequency to extend session lifetimes on trusted devices, locations, or low-risk sessions as an alternative to the remember MFA on a trusted device setting. To get started, review our [latest guidance on optimizing the reauthentication experience](../authentication/concepts-azure-multi-factor-authentication-prompts-session-lifetime.md).
