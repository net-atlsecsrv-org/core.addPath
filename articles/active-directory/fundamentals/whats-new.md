## July 2020

### As an IT Admin, I want to target client apps using Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
With the GA release of the client apps condition in Conditional Access, new policies will now apply by default to all client applications, including legacy authentication clients. Existing policies will remain unchanged, but the *Configure Yes/No* toggle will be removed from existing policies to easily see which client apps  are applied to by the policy. 

When creating a new policy, make sure to exclude users and service accounts that are still using legacy authentication; if you don't, they will be blocked. [Learn more](https://aka.ms/caclientapps).

### Upcoming SCIM compliance fixes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The Azure AD provisioning service leverages the SCIM standard for integrating with applications. Our implementation of the SCIM standard is evolving, and we expect to make changes to our behavior around how we perform PATCH operations as well as set the property "active" on a resource. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-scim-compatibility).

### Group owner setting on Azure Admin portal will be changed

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

Owner settings on Groups general setting page can be configured to restrict owner assignment privileges to a limited group of users in the Azure Admin portal and Access Panel. We will soon have the ability to assign group owner privilege not only on these two UX portals but also enforce the policy on the backend to provide consistent behavior across endpoints, such as PowerShell and Microsoft Graph. 

We will start to disable the current setting for the customers who are not using it and will offer an option to scope users for group owner privilege in the next few months. For guidance on updating group settings, see Edit your group information using [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-settings-azure-portal?context=azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/context/ugr-context).

### Azure Active Directory Registration Service is ending support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Device Registration and Management  
**Product capability:** Platform

Transport layer security (TLS) 1.2 and update servers and clients will soon communicate with Azure Active Directory Device Registration Service. Support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for communication with Azure AD Device Registration service will retire:
- On August 31, 2020, in all sovereign clouds (GCC High, DoD, etc.)
- On October 30, 2020, in all commercial clouds

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/devices/reference-device-registration-tls-1-2) about TLS 1.2 for the Azure AD Registration Service.

### Windows Hello for Business Sign Ins visible in Azure AD Sign In Logs

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Windows Hello for Business allows end-users to sign into Windows machines with a gesture (such as a PIN or biometric). Azure AD admins may want to differentiate Windows Hello for Business sign-ins from other Windows sign-ins as part of an organization's journey to passwordless authentication. 

Admins can now see whether a Windows authentication used Windows Hello for Business by checking the Authentication Details tab for a Windows sign-in event in the Azure AD Sign-Ins blade in the Azure Portal. Windows Hello for Business authentications will include "WindowsHelloForBusiness" in the Authentication Method field. For more information on interpreting Sign-In Logs, please see the [Sign-In Logs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins).

### Fixes to group deletion behavior and performance improvements

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Previously, when a group changed from "in-scope" to "out-of-scope" and an admin clicked restart before the change was completed, the group object was not being deleted. Now the group object will be deleted from the target application when it goes out of scope (disabled, deleted, unassigned, or did not pass scoping filter). [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/how-provisioning-works#incremental-cycles).

### Public Preview: Admins can now add custom content in the email to reviewers when creating an access review

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Access Reviews  
**Product capability:** Identity Governance
 
When a new access review is created, the reviewer receives an email requesting them to complete the access review. Many of our customers asked for the ability to add custom content to the email, such as contact information, or other additional supporting content to guide the reviewer. 

Now available in public preview, administrators can specify custom content in the email sent to reviewers by adding content in the "advanced" section of Azure AD Access Reviews. For guidance on creating access reviews, see [Create an access review of groups and applications in Azure AD access reviews](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/governance/create-access-review).
 
---

### Authorization Code Flow for Single-page apps available

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Because of modern browser 3rd party cookie restrictions such as Safari ITP, SPAs will have to use the authorization code flow rather than the implicit flow to maintain SSO, and MSAL.js v 2.x will now support the authorization code flow. 

There are corresponding updates to the Azure portal so you can update your SPA to be type "spa" and use the auth code flow. See [Sign in users and get an access token in a JavaScript SPA using the auth code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code) for further guidance.

### Azure AD Application Proxy now supports the Remote Desktop Services Web Client

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

Azure AD Application Proxy now supports the Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Web Client. The RDS web client allows users to access Remote Desktop infrastructure through any HTLM5-capable browser such as Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome, etc. Users can interact with remote apps or desktops like they would with a local device from anywhere. By using Azure AD Application Proxy you can increase the security of your RDS deployment by enforcing pre-authentication and Conditional Access policies for all types of rich client apps. For guidance, see [Publish Remote Desktop with Azure AD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services).

Currently, enumerated types are used to represent the riskType property in both the riskDetections API and riskyUserHistoryItem (in preview). Enumerated types are also used for the riskEventTypes property in the signIns API. Going forward we will represent these properties as strings. 

Customers should transition to the riskEventType property in the beta riskDetections and riskyUserHistoryItem API, and to riskEventTypes_v2 property in the beta signIns API by September 9th, 2020. At that date, we will be retiring the current riskType and riskEventTypes properties. For more information, refer to [Changes to risk event properties and Identity Protection APIs on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/changes-to-risk-event-properties-and-identity-protection-apis-on-microsoft-graph/).

### Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Enumerated types will switch to string types when representing risk event properties in Microsoft Graph September 2020. In addition to impacting the preview APIs, this change will also impact the in-production signIns API.

We have introduced a new riskEventsTypes_v2 (string) property to the signIns v1.0 API. We will retire the current riskEventTypes (enum) property on June 11, 2022 in accordance with our Microsoft Graph deprecation policy. Customers should transition to the riskEventTypes_v2 property in the v1.0  signIns API by June 11, 2022. For more information, refer to [Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/deprecation-of-riskeventtypes-property-in-signins-v1-0-api-on-microsoft-graph//).

### Upcoming changes to MFA email notifications

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We are making the following changes to the email notifications for cloud MFA:

### New self-service sign up for users in federated domains who can't access Microsoft Teams because they aren't synced to Azure Active Directory.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 

Currently, users who are in domains federated in Azure AD, but who are not synced into the tenant, can't access Teams. Starting at the end of June, this new capability will enable them to do so by extending the existing email verified sign up feature. This will allow users who can sign in to a federated IdP, but who don't yet have a user object in Azure ID, to have a user object created automatically and be authenticated for Teams. Their user object will be marked as "self-service sign up." This is an extension of the existing capability to do email verified self-sign up that users in managed domains can do and can be controlled using the same flag. This change will complete rolling out during the following two months. Watch for documentation updates [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup).

### Upcoming fix: The OIDC discovery document for the Azure Government cloud is being updated to reference the correct Graph endpoints.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting in June, the OIDC discovery document [Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) on the [Azure Government cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud) endpoint (login.microsoftonline.us), will begin to return the correct [National cloud graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments) endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.us or https://dod-graph.microsoft.us), based on the tenant provided.  It currently provides the incorrect Graph endpoint (graph.microsoft.com) "msgraph_host" field.  

This bug fix will be rolled out gradually over approximately 2 months.

### Azure Government users will no longer be able to sign in on login.microsoftonline.com

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
On 1 June 2018, the official Azure Active Directory (AAD) Authority for Azure Government changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us. If you own an application within an Azure Government tenant, you must update your application to sign users in on the .us endpoint.

Starting May 5th, Azure AD will begin enforcing the endpoint change, blocking Azure Government users from signing into apps hosted in Azure Government tenants using the public endpoint (microsoftonline.com). Impacted apps will begin seeing an error AADSTS900439 - USGClientNotSupportedOnPublicEndpoint. 

There will be a gradual rollout of this change with enforcement expected to be complete across all apps June 2020. For more details, please see the [Azure Government blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-government-aad-authority-endpoint-update/).

### SAML Single Logout request now sends NameID in the correct format

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
When a user clicks on sign-out (e.g., in the MyApps portal), Azure AD sends a SAML Single Logout message to each app that is active in the user session and has a Logout URL configured. These messages contain a NameID in a persistent format.

If the original SAML sign-in token used a different format for NameID (e.g. email/UPN), then the SAML app cannot correlate the NameID in the logout message to an existing session (as the NameIDs used in both messages are different), which caused the logout message to be discarded by the SAML app and the user to stay logged in. This fix makes the sign-out message consistent with the NameID configured for the application.

### Hybrid Identity Administrator role is now available with Cloud Provisioning

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning

### The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available

**Type:** Changed Feature   
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available. 

Previously, you had to manage your B2C consumer-facing applications separately from the rest of your apps using the legacy 'Applications' experience. That meant different app creation experiences across different places in Azure.

The new experience shows all B2C app registrations and Azure AD app registrations in one place and provides a consistent way to manage them. Whether you need to manage a customer-facing app or an app that has access to Microsoft Graph to programmatically manage Azure AD B2C resources, you only need to learn one way to do things.

You can reach the new experience by navigating the Azure AD B2C service and selecting the App registrations blade. The experience is also accessible from the Azure Active Directory service.

The Azure AD B2C App registrations experience is based on the general [App Registration experience](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/new-app-registrations-experience-is-now-generally-available/) for Azure AD tenants but is tailored for Azure AD B2C. The legacy "Applications" experience will be deprecated in the future.

### Administrative Units Public Preview

**Type:** New feature

**Service category:** RBAC

**Product capability:** Access Control

Administrative units allow you to grant admin permissions that are restricted to a department, region, or other segment of your organization that you define. You can use administrative units to delegate permissions to regional administrators or to set policy at a granular level. For example, a User account admin could update profile information, reset passwords, and assign licenses for users only in their administrative unit.

Using administrative units, a central administrator could:

- Create an administrative unit for decentralized management of resources
- Assign a role with administrative permissions over only Azure AD users in an administrative unit
- Populate the administrative units with users and groups as needed

### Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps now support the latest versions of Workday Web Services API

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** 

Based on customer feedback, we have now updated the Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps in the enterprise app gallery to support the latest versions of the Workday Web Services (WWS) API. With this change, customers can specify the WWS API version that they would like to use in the connection string. This gives customers the ability to retrieve more HR attributes available in the releases of Workday. The Workday Writeback app now uses the recommended Change_Work_Contact_Info Workday web service to overcome the limitations of Maintain_Contact_Info.

If no version is specified in the connection string, by default, the Workday inbound provisioning apps will continue to use WWS v21.1  To switch to the latest Workday APIs for inbound user provisioning, customers need to update the connection string as documented [in the tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial#which-workday-apis-does-the-solution-use-to-query-and-update-workday-worker-profiles) and also update the XPATHs used for Workday attributes as documented in the [Workday attribute reference guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/workday-attribute-reference#xpath-values-for-workday-web-services-wws-api-v30). 

To use the new API for writeback, there are no changes required in the Workday Writeback provisioning app. On the Workday side, ensure that the Workday Integration System User (ISU) account has permissions to invoke the Change_Work_Contact business process as documented in the tutorial section, [Configure business process security policy permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial#configuring-business-process-security-policy-permissions). 

We have updated our [tutorial guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial) to reflect the new API version support.

### Users with default access role are now in scope for provisioning

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

Historically, users with the default access role have been out of scope for provisioning. We've heard feedback that customers want users with this role to be in scope for provisioning. As of April 16, 2020, all new provisioning configurations allow users with the default access role to be provisioned. Gradually we will change the behavior for existing provisioning configurations to support provisioning users with this role.

### Dynamic Group rule validation is now available for Public Preview

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** Group Management

**Product capability:** Collaboration

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) now provides the means to validate dynamic group rules. On the **Validate rules** tab, you can validate your dynamic rule against sample group members to confirm the rule is working as expected. When creating or updating dynamic group rules, administrators want to know whether a user or a device will be a member of the group. This helps evaluate whether a user or device meets the rule criteria and aids in troubleshooting when membership is not expected.

For more information, see [Validate a dynamic group membership rule (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-rule-validation).

### Identity Secure Score - Security Defaults and MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** N/A

**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

**Supporting security defaults for Azure AD improvement actions:** Microsoft Secure Score will be updating improvement actions to support [security defaults in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults), which make it easier to help protect your organization with pre-configured security settings for common attacks. This will affect the following improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles
- Enable policy to block legacy authentication
 
**MFA improvement action updates:** To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score has removed three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication and added two.

Removed improvement actions:

- Register all users for multi-factor authentication
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

Added improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions require registering your users or admins for multi-factor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. That can take the form of having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions, or setting security defaults (as of March 16th) that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA.

### SSPR (self-service password reset) now requires two gates for admins in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Self-Service Password Reset  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
Previously in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet), admins using self-service password reset (SSPR) to reset their own passwords needed only one "gate" (challenge) to prove their identity. In public and other national clouds, admins generally must use two gates to prove their identity when using SSPR. But because we didn't support SMS or phone calls in Azure China 21Vianet, we allowed one-gate password reset by admins.

We're creating SSPR feature parity between Azure China 21Vianet and the public cloud. Going forward, admins must use two gates when using SSPR. SMS, phone calls, and Authenticator app notifications and codes will be supported. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy#administrator-reset-policy-differences).

### Password length is limited to 256 characters

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
To ensure the reliability of the Azure AD service, user passwords are now limited in length to 256 characters. Users with passwords longer than this will be asked to change their password on subsequent login, either by contacting their admin or by using the self-service password reset feature.

This change was enabled on March 13th, 2020, at 10AM PST (18:00 UTC), and the error is AADSTS 50052, InvalidPasswordExceedsMaxLength. See the [breaking change notice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#user-passwords-will-be-restricted-to-256-characters) for more details.

### Deprecation of Directory-wide groups option from Groups General Settings on Azure portal

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

To provide a more flexible way for customers to create directory-wide groups that best meet their needs, we've replaced the **Directory-wide Groups** option from the **Groups** > **General** settings in the Azure portal with a link to [dynamic group documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership). We've improved our documentation to include more instructions so administrators can create all-user groups that include or exclude guest users.

## February 2020

### Upcoming changes to custom controls

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
We're planning to replace the current custom controls preview with an approach that allows partner-provided authentication capabilities to work seamlessly with the Azure Active Directory administrator and end user experiences. Today, partner MFA solutions face the following limitations: they work only after a password has been entered; they don't serve as MFA for step-up authentication in other key scenarios; and they don't integrate with end user or administrative credential management functions. The new implementation will allow partner-provided authentication factors to work alongside built-in factors for key scenarios, including registration, usage, MFA claims, step up authentication, reporting, and logging. 

Custom controls will continue to be supported in preview alongside the new design until it reaches general availability. At that point, we'll give customers time to migrate to the new design. Because of the limitations of the current approach, we won't onboard new providers until the new design is available. We are working closely with customers and providers and will communicate the timeline as we get closer.

### Identity Secure Score - MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score is removing three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication (MFA), and adding two.

The following improvement actions will be removed:

- Register all users for MFA
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

The following improvement actions will be added:

- Ensure all users can complete MFA for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions will require registering your users or admins for MFA across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. This can take the form of setting security defaults that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA, or having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions. As part of these improvement action updates, Baseline protection policies will no longer be included in scoring calculations. [Read more about what's coming in Microsoft Secure Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score-whats-coming?view=o365-worldwide).

### Azure AD Domain Services SKU selection

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services
 
We've heard feedback that Azure AD Domain Services customers want more flexibility in selecting performance levels for their instances. Starting on February 1, 2020, we switched from a dynamic model (where Azure AD determines the performance and pricing tier based on object count) to a self-selection model. Now customers can choose a performance tier that matches their environment. This change also allows us to enable new scenarios like Resource Forests, and Premium features like daily backups. The object count is now unlimited for all SKUs, but we'll continue to offer object count suggestions for each tier.

**No immediate customer action is required.** For existing customers, the dynamic tier that was in use on February 1, 2020, determines the new default tier. There is no pricing or performance impact as the result of this change. Going forward, Azure AD DS customers will need to evaluate performance requirements as their directory size and workload characteristics change. Switching between service tiers will continue to be a no-downtime operation, and we will no longer automatically move customers to new tiers based on the growth of their directory. Furthermore, there will be no price increases, and new pricing will align with our current billing model. For more information, see the [Azure AD DS SKUs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/administration-concepts#azure-ad-ds-skus) and the [Azure AD Domain Services pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/).

### Azure AD support for FIDO2 security keys in hybrid environments

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
We're announcing the public preview of Azure AD support for FIDO2 security keys in Hybrid environments. Users can now use FIDO2 security keys to sign in to their Hybrid Azure AD joined Windows 10 devices and get seamless sign-on to their on-premises and cloud resources. Support for Hybrid environments has been the top most-requested feature from our passwordless customers since we initially launched the public preview for FIDO2 support in Azure AD joined devices. Passwordless authentication using advanced technologies like biometrics and public/private key cryptography provide convenience and ease-of-use while being secure. With this public preview, you can now use modern authentication like FIDO2 security keys to access traditional Active Directory resources. For more information, go to [SSO to on-premises resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key-on-premises). 

To get started, visit [enable FIDO2 security keys for your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key) for step-by-step instructions.
