### New delegation role in Azure AD entitlement management: Access package assignment manager

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 
A new Access Package Assignment Manager role has been added in Azure AD entitlement management to provide granular permissions to manage assignments. You can now delegate tasks to a user in this role, who can delegate assignments management of an access package to a business owner. However, an Access Package Assignment Manager can't alter the access package policies or other properties that are set by the administrators. 

With this new role, you benefit from the least privileges needed to delegate management of assignments and maintain administrative control on all other access package configurations. To learn more, see [Entitlement management roles](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md#entitlement-management-roles).
 
---

### Changes to Privileged Identity Management's onboarding flow

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Previously, onboarding to Privileged Identity Management (PIM) required user consent and an onboarding flow in PIM's blade that included enrollment in Azure MFA. With the recent integration of PIM experience into the Azure AD roles and administrators blade, we are removing this experience. Any tenant with valid P2 license will be auto-onboarded to PIM.

Onboarding to PIM does not have any direct adverse effect on your tenant. You can expect the following changes:
- Additional assignment options such as active vs. eligible with start and end time when you make an assignment in either PIM or Azure AD roles and administrators blade. 
- Additional scoping mechanisms, like Administrative Units and custom roles, introduced directly into the assignment experience. 
- If you are a global administrator or privileged role administrator, you may start getting a few additional emails like the PIM weekly digest. 
- You might also see ms-pim service principal in the audit log related to role assignment. This expected change shouldn't affect your regular workflow.

 For more information, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md).

### Azure AD Entitlement Management: The Select pane of access package resources now shows by default the resources currently in the selected catalog

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 

In the access package creation flow, under the Resource roles tab, the Select pane behavior is changing. Currently, the default behavior is to show all resources that are owned by the user and resources added to the selected catalog. 

This experience will be changed to display only the resources currently added in the catalog by default, so that users can easily pick resources from the catalog. The update will help with discoverability of the resources to add to access packages, and reduce risk of inadvertently adding resources owned by the user that aren't part of the catalog. To learn more, see [Create a new access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles).
 
---

## August 2020 
 
### Updates to Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server firewall requirements

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
Starting 1 October 2020, Azure MFA Server firewall requirements will require additional IP ranges.

If you have outbound firewall rules in your organization, update the rules so that your MFA servers can communicate with all the necessary IP ranges. The IP ranges are documented in [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server firewall requirements](../authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy.md#azure-multi-factor-authentication-server-firewall-requirements).

### Authorization Code Flow for Single-page apps available

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Because of modern browser 3rd party cookie restrictions such as Safari ITP, SPAs will have to use the authorization code flow rather than the implicit flow to maintain SSO, and MSAL.js v 2.x will now support the authorization code flow. 

There are corresponding updates to the Azure portal so you can update your SPA to be type "spa" and use the auth code flow. See [Sign in users and get an access token in a JavaScript SPA using the auth code flow](../develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code.md) for further guidance.

## May 2020

### Retirement of properties in signIns, riskyUsers, and riskDetections APIs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Currently, enumerated types are used to represent the riskType property in both the riskDetections API and riskyUserHistoryItem (in preview). Enumerated types are also used for the riskEventTypes property in the signIns API. Going forward we will represent these properties as strings. 

Customers should transition to the riskEventType property in the beta riskDetections and riskyUserHistoryItem API, and to riskEventTypes_v2 property in the beta signIns API by September 9th, 2020. At that date, we will be retiring the current riskType and riskEventTypes properties. For more information, refer to [Changes to risk event properties and Identity Protection APIs on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/changes-to-risk-event-properties-and-identity-protection-apis-on-microsoft-graph/).

--- 

### Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Enumerated types will switch to string types when representing risk event properties in Microsoft Graph September 2020. In addition to impacting the preview APIs, this change will also impact the in-production signIns API.

We have introduced a new riskEventsTypes_v2 (string) property to the signIns v1.0 API. We will retire the current riskEventTypes (enum) property on June 11, 2022 in accordance with our Microsoft Graph deprecation policy. Customers should transition to the riskEventTypes_v2 property in the v1.0  signIns API by June 11, 2022. For more information, refer to [Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/deprecation-of-riskeventtypes-property-in-signins-v1-0-api-on-microsoft-graph//).

### Upcoming changes to MFA email notifications

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We are making the following changes to the email notifications for cloud MFA:

E-mail notifications will be sent from the following address: azure-noreply@microsoft.com and msonlineservicesteam@microsoftonline.com. We're updating the content of fraud alert emails to better indicate the required steps to unblock uses.

### New self-service sign up for users in federated domains who can't access Microsoft Teams because they aren't synced to Azure Active Directory.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 

Currently, users who are in domains federated in Azure AD, but who are not synced into the tenant, can't access Teams. Starting at the end of June, this new capability will enable them to do so by extending the existing email verified sign up feature. This will allow users who can sign in to a federated IdP, but who don't yet have a user object in Azure ID, to have a user object created automatically and be authenticated for Teams. Their user object will be marked as "self-service sign up." This is an extension of the existing capability to do email verified self-sign up that users in managed domains can do and can be controlled using the same flag. This change will complete rolling out during the following two months. Watch for documentation updates [here](../users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup.md).
 
---

### Upcoming fix: The OIDC discovery document for the Azure Government cloud is being updated to reference the correct Graph endpoints.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting in June, the OIDC discovery document [Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocol](../develop/v2-protocols-oidc.md) on the [Azure Government cloud](../develop/authentication-national-cloud.md) endpoint (login.microsoftonline.us), will begin to return the correct [National cloud graph](/graph/deployments) endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.us or https://dod-graph.microsoft.us), based on the tenant provided.  It currently provides the incorrect Graph endpoint (graph.microsoft.com) "msgraph_host" field.  

This bug fix will be rolled out gradually over approximately 2 months.  

---

### Azure Government users will no longer be able to sign in on login.microsoftonline.com

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
On 1 June 2018, the official Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authority for Azure Government changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us. If you own an application within an Azure Government tenant, you must update your application to sign users in on the .us endpoint.

Starting May 5th, Azure AD will begin enforcing the endpoint change, blocking Azure Government users from signing into apps hosted in Azure Government tenants using the public endpoint (microsoftonline.com). Impacted apps will begin seeing an error AADSTS900439 - USGClientNotSupportedOnPublicEndpoint. 

There will be a gradual rollout of this change with enforcement expected to be complete across all apps June 2020. For more details, please see the [Azure Government blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-government-aad-authority-endpoint-update/).

### SAML Single Logout request now sends NameID in the correct format

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
When a user clicks on sign-out (e.g., in the MyApps portal), Azure AD sends a SAML Single Logout message to each app that is active in the user session and has a Logout URL configured. These messages contain a NameID in a persistent format.

If the original SAML sign-in token used a different format for NameID (e.g. email/UPN), then the SAML app cannot correlate the NameID in the logout message to an existing session (as the NameIDs used in both messages are different), which caused the logout message to be discarded by the SAML app and the user to stay logged in. This fix makes the sign-out message consistent with the NameID configured for the application.

---

### Hybrid Identity Administrator role is now available with Cloud Provisioning

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
IT Admins can start using the new "Hybrid Admin" role as the least privileged role for setting up Azure ADConnect Cloud Provisioning. With this new role, you no longer have to use the Global Admin role to setup and configure Cloud Provisioning. [Learn more](../users-groups-roles/roles-delegate-by-task.md#connect).

### The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available

**Type:** Changed Feature   
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available. 

Previously, you had to manage your B2C consumer-facing applications separately from the rest of your apps using the legacy 'Applications' experience. That meant different app creation experiences across different places in Azure.

The new experience shows all B2C app registrations and Azure AD app registrations in one place and provides a consistent way to manage them. Whether you need to manage a customer-facing app or an app that has access to Microsoft Graph to programmatically manage Azure AD B2C resources, you only need to learn one way to do things.

You can reach the new experience by navigating the Azure AD B2C service and selecting the App registrations blade. The experience is also accessible from the Azure Active Directory service.

The Azure AD B2C App registrations experience is based on the general [App Registration experience](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/new-app-registrations-experience-is-now-generally-available/) for Azure AD tenants but is tailored for Azure AD B2C. The legacy "Applications" experience will be deprecated in the future.

### Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps now support the latest versions of Workday Web Services API

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** 

Based on customer feedback, we have now updated the Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps in the enterprise app gallery to support the latest versions of the Workday Web Services (WWS) API. With this change, customers can specify the WWS API version that they would like to use in the connection string. This gives customers the ability to retrieve more HR attributes available in the releases of Workday. The Workday Writeback app now uses the recommended Change_Work_Contact_Info Workday web service to overcome the limitations of Maintain_Contact_Info.

If no version is specified in the connection string, by default, the Workday inbound provisioning apps will continue to use WWS v21.1  To switch to the latest Workday APIs for inbound user provisioning, customers need to update the connection string as documented [in the tutorial](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#which-workday-apis-does-the-solution-use-to-query-and-update-workday-worker-profiles) and also update the XPATHs used for Workday attributes as documented in the [Workday attribute reference guide](../app-provisioning/workday-attribute-reference.md#xpath-values-for-workday-web-services-wws-api-v30). 

To use the new API for writeback, there are no changes required in the Workday Writeback provisioning app. On the Workday side, ensure that the Workday Integration System User (ISU) account has permissions to invoke the Change_Work_Contact business process as documented in the tutorial section, [Configure business process security policy permissions](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#configuring-business-process-security-policy-permissions). 

We have updated our [tutorial guide](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md) to reflect the new API version support.

### Users with default access role are now in scope for provisioning

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

Historically, users with the default access role have been out of scope for provisioning. We've heard feedback that customers want users with this role to be in scope for provisioning. As of April 16, 2020, all new provisioning configurations allow users with the default access role to be provisioned. Gradually we will change the behavior for existing provisioning configurations to support provisioning users with this role.

### Dynamic Group rule validation is now available for Public Preview

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** Group Management

**Product capability:** Collaboration

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) now provides the means to validate dynamic group rules. On the **Validate rules** tab, you can validate your dynamic rule against sample group members to confirm the rule is working as expected. When creating or updating dynamic group rules, administrators want to know whether a user or a device will be a member of the group. This helps evaluate whether a user or device meets the rule criteria and aids in troubleshooting when membership is not expected.

For more information, see [Validate a dynamic group membership rule (preview)](../users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-rule-validation.md).

### Identity Secure Score - Security Defaults and MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** N/A

**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

**Supporting security defaults for Azure AD improvement actions:** Microsoft Secure Score will be updating improvement actions to support [security defaults in Azure AD](./concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md), which make it easier to help protect your organization with pre-configured security settings for common attacks. This will affect the following improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles
- Enable policy to block legacy authentication
 
**MFA improvement action updates:** To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score has removed three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication and added two.

Removed improvement actions:

- Register all users for multi-factor authentication
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

Added improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions require registering your users or admins for multi-factor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. That can take the form of having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions, or setting security defaults (as of March 16th) that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA. [Read more about what's new in Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide#whats-new).
