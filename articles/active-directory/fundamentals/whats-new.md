## April 2021

### Bug fixed - Azure AD will no longer double-encode the state parameter in responses

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Azure AD has identified, tested, and released a fix for a bug in the `/authorize` response to a client application.  Azure AD was incorrectly URL encoding the `state` parameter twice when sending responses back to the client.  This can cause a client application to reject the request, due to a mismatch in state parameters. [Learn more](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#bug-fix-azure-ad-will-no-longer-url-encode-the-state-parameter-twice).

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

Starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode authentication](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios.

---

### Unrequested but consented permissions will no longer be added to tokens if they would trigger Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform
 
Currently, applications using [dynamic permissions](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-individual-user-consent) are given all of the permissions they're consented to access. This includes applications that are unrequested and even if they trigger conditional access. For example, this can cause an app requesting only `user.read` that also has consent for `files.read`, to be forced to pass the Conditional Access assigned for the `files.read` permission. 

To reduce the number of unnecessary Conditional Access prompts, Azure AD is changing the way that unrequested scopes are provided to applications. Apps will only trigger conditional access for permission they explicitly request. For more information, read [What's new in authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#conditional-access-will-only-trigger-for-explicitly-requested-scopes).

**Service category:** RBAC  
**Product capability:** Access Control
 
Users with this role can manage (read, add, verify, update, and delete) domain names. They can also read directory information about users, groups, and applications, as these objects have domain dependencies. 

For on-premises environments, users with this role can configure domain names for federation so that associated users are always authenticated on-premises. These users can then sign into Azure AD-based services with their on-premises passwords via single sign-on. Federation settings need to be synced via Azure AD Connect, so users also have permissions to manage Azure AD Connect. [Learn more](../roles/permissions-reference.md#domain-name-administrator).

### New enhanced Dynamic Group service is in Public Preview

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration
 
Enhanced dynamic group service is now in Public Preview. New customers that create dynamic groups in their tenants will be using the new service. The time required to create a dynamic group will be proportional to the size of the group that is being created instead of the size of the tenant. This update will improve performance for large tenants significantly when customers create smaller groups. 

The new service also aims to complete member addition and removal because of attribute changes within a few minutes. Also, single processing failures won't block tenant processing. To learn more about creating dynamic groups, see our [documentation](../enterprise-users/groups-create-rule.md).
