## October 2020

### Azure AD On-Premises Hybrid Agents Impacted by Azure TLS Certificate Changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Microsoft is updating Azure services to use TLS certificates from a different set of Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). This update is due to the current CA certificates not complying with one of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements. This change will impact Azure AD hybrid agents installed on-premises that have hardened environments with a fixed list of root certificates and will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises, [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords, and [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that perform AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you will need to allow the following CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

### Provisioning events will be removed from audit logs and published solely to provisioning logs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Activity by the SCIM [provisioning service](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) is logged in both the audit logs and provisioning logs. This includes activity such as the creation of a user in ServiceNow, group in GSuite, or import of a role from AWS. In the future, these events will only be published in the provisioning logs. This change is being implemented to avoid duplicate events across logs, and additional costs incurred by customers consuming the logs in log analytics. 

We'll provide an update when a date is completed. This deprecation isn't planned for the calendar year 2020. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact any events in the audit logs outside of the synchronization events emitted by the provisioning service. Events such as the creation of an application, conditional access policy, a user in the directory, etc. will continue to be emitted in the audit logs. [Learn more](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fapp-provisioning%2fcontext%2fapp-provisioning-context).

We've recently updated the [remember Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](../authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#remember-multi-factor-authentication) on a trusted device feature to extend authentication for up to 365 days. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium licenses, can also use the [Conditional Access â Sign-in Frequency policy](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md#user-sign-in-frequency) that provides more flexibility for reauthentication settings.

For the optimal user experience, we recommend using Conditional Access sign-in frequency to extend session lifetimes on trusted devices, locations, or low-risk sessions as an alternative to the remember MFA on a trusted device setting. To get started, review our [latest guidance on optimizing the reauthentication experience](../authentication/concepts-azure-multi-factor-authentication-prompts-session-lifetime.md).

### Cloud Provisioning Public Preview Refresh

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning 
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Azure AD Connect Cloud Provisioning public preview refresh features two major enhancements developed from customer feedback: 

- Attribute Mapping Experience through Azure portal

    With this feature, IT Admins can map user, group, or contact attributes from AD to Azure AD using various mapping types present today. Attribute mapping is a feature used for standardizing the values of the attributes that flow from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory. One can determine whether to directly map the attribute value as it is from AD to Azure AD or use expressions to transform the attribute values when provisioning users. [Learn more](../cloud-provisioning/how-to-attribute-mapping.md)

- On-demand Provisioning or Test User experience

    Once you have setup your configuration, you might want to test to see if the user transformation is working as expected before applying it to all your users in scope. With on-demand provisioning, IT Admins can enter the Distinguished Name (DN) of an AD user and see if they are getting synced as expected. On-demand provisioning provides a great way to ensure that the attribute mappings you did previously work as expected. [Learn More](../cloud-provisioning/how-to-on-demand-provision.md)

### New delegation role in Azure AD entitlement management: Access package assignment manager

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 
A new Access Package Assignment Manager role has been added in Azure AD entitlement management to provide granular permissions to manage assignments. You can now delegate tasks to a user in this role, who can delegate assignments management of an access package to a business owner. However, an Access Package Assignment Manager can't alter the access package policies or other properties that are set by the administrators. 

With this new role, you benefit from the least privileges needed to delegate management of assignments and maintain administrative control on all other access package configurations. To learn more, see [Entitlement management roles](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md#entitlement-management-roles).
 
---

### Changes to Privileged Identity Management's onboarding flow

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Previously, onboarding to Privileged Identity Management (PIM) required user consent and an onboarding flow in PIM's blade that included enrollment in Azure AD MFA. With the recent integration of PIM experience into the Azure AD roles and administrators blade, we are removing this experience. Any tenant with valid P2 license will be auto-onboarded to PIM.

Onboarding to PIM does not have any direct adverse effect on your tenant. You can expect the following changes:
- Additional assignment options such as active vs. eligible with start and end time when you make an assignment in either PIM or Azure AD roles and administrators blade. 
- Additional scoping mechanisms, like Administrative Units and custom roles, introduced directly into the assignment experience. 
- If you are a global administrator or privileged role administrator, you may start getting a few additional emails like the PIM weekly digest. 
- You might also see ms-pim service principal in the audit log related to role assignment. This expected change shouldn't affect your regular workflow.

 For more information, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md).

### Azure AD Entitlement Management: The Select pane of access package resources now shows by default the resources currently in the selected catalog

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 

In the access package creation flow, under the Resource roles tab, the Select pane behavior is changing. Currently, the default behavior is to show all resources that are owned by the user and resources added to the selected catalog. 

This experience will be changed to display only the resources currently added in the catalog by default, so that users can easily pick resources from the catalog. The update will help with discoverability of the resources to add to access packages, and reduce risk of inadvertently adding resources owned by the user that aren't part of the catalog. To learn more, see [Create a new access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles).

By using Azure AD Application Proxy you can increase the security of your RDS deployment by enforcing pre-authentication and Conditional Access policies for all types of rich client apps. For guidance, see [Publish Remote Desktop with Azure AD Application Proxy](../manage-apps/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services.md).
