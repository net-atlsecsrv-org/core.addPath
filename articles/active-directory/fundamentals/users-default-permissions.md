# What are the default user permissions in Azure Active Directory?
In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), all users are granted a set of default permissions. A userâ€™s access consists of the type of user, their [role assignments](active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal.md), and their ownership of individual objects. This article describes those default permissions and contains a comparison of the member and guest user defaults. The default user permissions can be changed only in user settings in Azure AD.

## Member and guest users
The set of default permissions received depends on whether the user is a native member of the tenant (member user) or if the user is brought over from another directory as a B2B collaboration guest (guest user). See [What is Azure AD B2B collaboration?](../external-identities/what-is-b2b.md) for more information about adding guest users.
* Member users can register applications, manage their own profile photo and mobile phone number, change their own password, and invite B2B guests. In addition, users can read all directory information (with a few exceptions). 
* Guest users have restricted directory permissions. They can manage their own profile, change their own password and retrieve some information about other users, groups and apps, however, they cannot read all directory information. For example, guest users cannot enumerate users, groups and other directory objects. Guests can be added to administrator roles, which grant them full read and write permissions contained in the role. Guests can also invite other guests.

## To restrict the default permissions for member users

Default permissions for member users can be restricted in the following ways:

Permission | Setting explanation
---------- | ------------
Users can register application | Setting this option to No prevents users from creating application registrations. The ability can then be granted back to specific individuals by adding them to the Application Developer role.
Allow users to connect work or school account with LinkedIn | Setting this option to No prevents users from connecting their work or school account with their LinkedIn account. For more information, see [LinkedIn account connections data sharing and consent](../users-groups-roles/linkedin-user-consent.md).
Ability to create security groups | Setting this option to No prevents users from creating security groups. Global administrators and User administrators can still create security groups. See [Azure Active Directory cmdlets for configuring group settings](../users-groups-roles/groups-settings-cmdlets.md) to learn how.
Ability to create Microsoft 365 groups | Setting this option to No prevents users from creating Microsoft 365 groups. Setting this option to Some allows a select set of users to create Microsoft 365 groups. Global administrators and User administrators will still be able to create Microsoft 365 groups. See [Azure Active Directory cmdlets for configuring group settings](../users-groups-roles/groups-settings-cmdlets.md) to learn how.
Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal | Setting this option to No lets non-administrators use the Azure AD administration portal to read and manage Azure AD resources. Yes restricts all non-administrators from accessing any Azure AD data in the administration portal.<p>**Note**: this setting does not restrict access to Azure AD data using PowerShell or other clients such as Visual Studio.When set to Yes, to grant a specific non-admin user the ability to use the Azure AD administration portal assign any administrative role such as the Directory Readers role.<p>This role allows reading basic directory information, which member users have by default (guests and service principals do not).
Ability to read other users | This setting is available in PowerShell only. Setting this flag to $false prevents all non-admins from reading user information from the directory. This flag does not prevent reading user information in other Microsoft services like Exchange Online. This setting is meant for special circumstances, and setting this flag to $false is not recommended.


## To restrict the default permissions for guest users

Default permissions for guest users can be restricted in the following ways:

>[!NOTE] 
>The guests user access restrictions setting replaced the **Guest users permissions are limited** setting. For guidance on using this feature, see [Restrict guest access permissions (preview) in Azure Active Directory](../users-groups-roles/users-restrict-guest-permissions.md).

Permission | Setting explanation
---------- | ------------
Guests user access restrictions (Preview) | Setting this option to Guest users have the same access as members grants all member user permissions to guest users by default.<p>Setting this option to Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects restricts guest access to only their own user profile by default. Access to other users are no longer allowed even when searching by User Principal Name or objectId. Access to groups including groups memberships is also no longer allowed. This setting does not prevent access to groups in other Microsoft services like Microsoft Teams. See [Microsoft Teams Guest access]() to learn more.<p>Guest users can still be added to administrator roles regardless of this permission settings.
Guests can invite | Setting this option to Yes allows guests to invite other guests. See [Delegate invitations for B2B collaboration](../external-identities/delegate-invitations.md#configure-b2b-external-collaboration-settings) to learn more.
Members can invite | Members can invite	Setting this option to Yes allows non-admin members of your directory to invite guests. See [Delegate invitations for B2B collaboration](../external-identities/delegate-invitations.md#configure-b2b-external-collaboration-settings) to learn more.
Admins and users in the guest inviter role can invite | Setting this option to Yes allows admins and users in the "Guest Inviter" role to invite guests. When set to Yes, users in the Guest inviter role will still be able to invite guests, regardless of the Members can invite setting. See [Delegate invitations for B2B collaboration](../external-identities/delegate-invitations.md#assign-the-guest-inviter-role-to-a-user) to learn more.

## Object ownership

### Application registration owner permissions
When a user registers an application, they are automatically added as an owner for the application. As an owner, they can manage the metadata of the application, such as the name and permissions the app requests. They can also manage the tenant-specific configuration of the application, such as the SSO configuration and user assignments. An owner can also add or remove other owners. Unlike Global Administrators, owners can only manage applications they own.

### Enterprise application owner permissions
When a user adds a new enterprise application, they are automatically added as an owner. As an owner, they can manage the tenant-specific configuration of the application, such as the SSO configuration, provisioning, and user assignments. An owner can also add or remove other owners. Unlike Global Administrators, owners can manage only the applications they own.

### Group owner permissions
When a user creates a group, they are automatically added as an owner for that group. As an owner, they can manage properties of the group such as the name, as well as manage group membership. An owner can also add or remove other owners. Unlike Global administrators and User administrators, owners can only manage groups they own. To assign a group owner, see [Managing owners for a group](active-directory-accessmanagement-managing-group-owners.md).
