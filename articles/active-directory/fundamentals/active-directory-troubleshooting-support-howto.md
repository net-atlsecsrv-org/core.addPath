# Find help and open a support ticket for Azure Active Directory
Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Support is available both online and by phone for Microsoft Azure paid and trial subscriptions. Phone support and online billing support are available in additional languages. 

## Find help without opening a support ticket

Before creating a support ticket, check out the following resources for answers and information. 

* For content such as how-to information or code samples for IT professionals and developers, see the [technical documentation at docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/).

* The [Microsoft Technical Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/) is the place for our IT pro partners and customers to collaborate, share, and learn. The [Microsoft Technical Community Info Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Community-Info-Center/ct-p/Community-Info-Center) is used for announcements, blog posts, ask-me-anything (AMA) interactions with experts, and more. You can also [join the community to submit your ideas](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Communities/ct-p/communities).


## Open a support ticket

If you are unable to find answers by using self-help resources, you can open an online support ticket. You should open each support ticket for only a single problem, so that we can connect you to the support engineers who are subject matter experts for your problem. Also, Azure Active Directory engineering teams prioritize their work based on incidents that are generated, so you're often contributing to service improvements.
