# Protecting Microsoft 365 from on-premises attacks

Many customers connect their private corporate networks to Microsoft 365
to benefit their users, devices, and applications. However, there are
many well-documented ways these private networks can be compromised. Because Microsoft 365 acts as the "nervous system" for many organizations, it is critical to protect it from compromised on-premises infrastructure.

This article shows you how to configure your systems to protect
your Microsoft 365 cloud environment from on-premises compromise. We
primarily focus on Azure AD tenant configuration settings, the ways
Azure AD tenants can be safely connected to on-premises systems, and the
tradeoffs required to operate your systems in ways that protect your
cloud systems from on-premises compromise.

We strongly recommend you implement this guidance to secure your
Microsoft 365 cloud environment.

## Primary threat vectors from compromised on-premises environments


Your Microsoft 365 cloud environment benefits from an extensive
monitoring and security infrastructure. Using machine learning and human
intelligence that looks across worldwide traffic can rapidly detect
attacks and allow you to reconfigure in near-real-time. In hybrid
deployments that connect on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft 365,
many organizations delegate trust to on-premises components for critical
authentication and directory object state management decisions.
Unfortunately, if the on-premises environment is compromised, these
trust relationships result in attackers' opportunities to compromise
your Microsoft 365 environment.

The two primary threat vectors are **federation trust relationships**
and **account synchronization.** Both vectors can grant an attacker
administrative access to your cloud.

* **Federated trust relationships**, such as SAML authentication, are
    used to authenticate to Microsoft 365 via your on-premises Identity
    Infrastructure. If a SAML token signing certificate is compromised,
    federation would allow anyone with that certificate to impersonate
    any user in your cloud. **We recommend you disable federation trust
    relationships for authentication to Microsoft 365 when possible.**

* **Account synchronization** can be used to modify privileged users
    (including their credentials) or groups granted administrative
    privileges in Microsoft 365. **We recommend you ensure that
    synchronized objects hold no privileges beyond a user in
    Microsoft 365,** either directly or via inclusion in trusted roles
    or groups. Ensure these objects have no direct or nested assignment
    in trusted cloud roles or groups.

## Protecting Microsoft 365 from on-premises compromise


To address the threat vectors outlined above, we recommend you adhere to
the principles illustrated below:

![Reference architecture for protecting Microsoft 365 ](media/protect-m365/protect-m365-principles.png)

*  **Fully Isolate your Microsoft 365 administrator accounts.** They
    should be

    * Mastered in Azure AD.

     * Authenticated with Multi-factor authentication (MFA).

     *  Secured by Azure AD conditional access.

     *  Accessed only by using Azure Managed Workstations.

These are restricted use accounts. **There should be no on-premises accounts with administrative privileges in Microsoft 365.** For more information, see this [overview of Microsoft 365 administrator roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide).
Also see [Roles for Microsoft 365 in Azure Active Directory](../roles/m365-workload-docs.md).

*  **Manage devices from Microsoft 365.** Use Azure AD Join and
    cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) to eliminate dependencies
    on your on-premises device management infrastructure, which can
    compromise device and security controls.

* **No on-premises account has elevated privileges to Microsoft 365.**
    Accounts accessing on-premises applications that require NTLM, LDAP,
    or Kerberos authentication need an account in the organization's
    on-premises identity infrastructure. Ensure that these accounts,
    including service accounts, are not included in privileged cloud
    roles or groups and that changes to these accounts cannot impact the
    integrity of your cloud environment. Privileged on-premises software
    must not be capable of impacting Microsoft 365 privileged accounts
    or roles.

*  **Use Azure AD cloud authentication** to eliminate dependencies on
    your on-premises credentials. Always use strong authentication,
    such as Windows Hello, FIDO, the Microsoft Authenticator, or Azure
    AD MFA.

## Specific Recommendations


The following sections provide specific guidance on how to implement the
principles described above.

### Isolate privileged identities


In Azure AD, users with privileged roles such as administrators are the root of trust to build and manage the rest of the environment. Implement the following practices to minimize the impact of a compromise.

* Use cloud-only accounts for Azure AD and Microsoft 365 privileged
    roles.d

* Deploy [privileged access devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/compass/privileged-access-devices#device-roles-and-profiles) for privileged access to manage Microsoft 365 and Azure AD.

*  Deploy [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-configure.md) (PIM) for just in time (JIT) access to all human accounts that have privileged roles, and require strong authentication to activate roles.

* Provide administrative roles the [least privilege possible to perform their tasks](../roles/delegate-by-task.md).

* To enable a richer role assignment experience that includes delegation and multiple roles at the same time, consider using Azure AD security groups or Microsoft 365 Groups (collectively "cloud groups") and [enable role-based access control](../roles/groups-assign-role.md). You can also use [Administrative Units](../roles/administrative-units.md) to restrict the scope of roles to a portion of the organization.

* Deploy [Emergency Access Accounts](../roles/security-emergency-access.md) and do NOT use on-premises password vaults to store credentials.

For more information, see [Securing privileged access](https://aka.ms/SPA), which has detailed guidance on this topic. Also, see [Secure access practices for administrators in Azure AD](../roles/security-planning.md).

### Use cloud authentication 

Credentials are a primary attack vector. Implement the following
practices to make credentials more secure.

* [Deploy passwordless authentication](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment.md): Reduce the use of passwords as much as possible by deploying passwordless credentials. These credentials are managed and
    validated natively in the cloud. Choose from:

   * [Windows Hello for business](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)

   * [Authenticator App](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-phone.md)

   * [FIDO2 security keys](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key-windows.md)

* [Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication](https://aka.ms/deploymentplans/mfa): Provision
    [multiple strong credentials using Azure AD MFA](../fundamentals/resilience-in-credentials.md). That way, access to cloud resources will require a credential that is managed in Azure AD in addition to an on-premises password that can be manipulated.

   * For more information, see [Create a resilient access control management strategy with Azure active Directory](https://aka.ms/resilientaad).

**Limitations and tradeoffs**

* Hybrid account password management requires hybrid components such as password protection agents and password writeback agents. If your on-premises infrastructure is compromised, attackers can control the machines on which these agents reside. While this will not
    compromise your cloud infrastructure, your cloud accounts will not protect these components from on-premises compromise.

*  On-premises accounts synced from Active Directory are marked to never expire in Azure AD, based on the assumption that on-premises AD password policies will mitigate this. If your on-premises AD is compromised and synchronization from AD connect needs to be disabled, you must set the option [EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers](../hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md).

## Provision User Access from the Cloud

Provisioning refers to the creation of user accounts and groups in applications or identity providers.

![Diagram of provisioning architecture](media/protect-m365/protect-m365-provision.png)

* **Provision from cloud HR apps to Azure AD:** This enables an on-premises compromise to be isolated without disrupting your Joiner-Mover-Leaver cycle from your cloud HR apps to Azure AD.

* **Cloud Applications:** Where possible, deploy [Azure AD App
    Provisioning](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) as
    opposed to on-premises provisioning solutions. This will protect
    some of your SaaS apps from being poisoned with malicious user
    profiles due to on-premises breaches. 

* **External Identities:** Use [Azure AD B2B
    collaboration](../external-identities/what-is-b2b.md).
    This will reduce the dependency on on-premises accounts for external
    collaboration with partners, customers, and suppliers. Carefully
    evaluate any direct federation with other identity providers. We
    recommend limiting B2B guest accounts in the following ways.

   *  Limit guest access to browsing groups and other properties in
        the directory. Use the external collaboration settings to restrict guest
            ability to read groups they are not members of. 

    *   Block access to the Azure portal. You can make rare necessary
        exceptions.  Create a Conditional Access policy that includes all guests
            and external users and then [implement a policy to block
            access](/azure/role-based-access-control/conditional-access-azure-management). 

* **Disconnected Forests:** Use [Azure AD Cloud
    Provisioning](../cloud-provisioning/what-is-cloud-provisioning.md). This enables you to connect to disconnected forests, eliminating the need to establish cross-forest connectivity or trusts, which can
    broaden the impact of an on-premises breach. * 
 
**Limitations and Tradeoffs:**

* When used to provision hybrid accounts, the Azure AD from cloud HR systems relies on on-premises synchronization to complete the data flow from AD to Azure AD. If synchronization is interrupted, new employee records will not be available in Azure AD.

## Use cloud groups for collaboration and access

Cloud groups allow you to decouple your collaboration and access from
your on-premises infrastructure.

* **Collaboration:** Use Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams for
    modern collaboration. Decommission on-premises distribution lists,
    and [Upgrade distribution lists to Microsoft 365 Groups in
    Outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/upgrade-distribution-lists?view=o365-worldwide).

* **Access:** Use Azure AD security groups or Microsoft 365 Groups to
    authorize access to applications in Azure AD.
* **Office 365 licensing:** Use group-based licensing to provision to
    Office 365 using cloud-only groups. This decouples control of group
    membership from on-premises infrastructure.

Owners of groups used for access should be considered privileged
identities to avoid membership takeover from on-premises compromise.
Take over includes direct manipulation of group membership on-premises
or manipulation of on-premises attributes that can affect dynamic group
membership in Microsoft 365.

## Manage devices from the cloud


Use Azure AD capabilities to securely manage devices.

-   **Use Windows 10 Workstations:** [Deploy Azure AD
    Joined](../devices/azureadjoin-plan.md)
    devices with MDM policies. Enable [Windows
    Autopilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot)
    for a fully automated provisioning experience.

    -   Deprecate Windows 8.1 and earlier machines.

    -   Do not deploy Server OS machines as workstations.

    -   Use [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/microsoft-intune)
        as the source of authority of all device management workloads.

-   [**Deploy privileged access devices**](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/compass/privileged-access-devices#device-roles-and-profiles)
    for privileged access to manage Microsoft 365 and Azure AD.

 ## Workloads, applications, and resources 

-   **On-premises SSO systems:** Deprecate any on-premises federation
    and Web Access Management infrastructure and configure applications
    to use Azure AD.  

-   **SaaS and LOB applications that support modern authentication
    protocols:** [Use Azure AD for single
    sign-on](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md). The
    more apps you configure to use Azure AD for authentication, the less
    risk in the case of an on-premises compromise.


* **Legacy Applications** 

   * Authentication, authorization, and remote access to legacy applications that do not support modern authentication can be enabled via [Azure AD Application Proxy](../manage-apps/application-proxy.md).They can also be enabled through a network or application delivery controller solution using  [secure hybrid access partner integrations](../manage-apps/secure-hybrid-access.md).   

   * Choose a VPN vendor that supports modern authentication and integrate its authentication with Azure AD. In the case of anon-premises compromise, you can use Azure AD to disable or block access by disabling the VPN.

*  **Application and workload servers**

   * Applications or resources that required servers can be migrated to Azure IaaS and use [Azure AD Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/overview) (Azure AD DS) to decouple trust and dependency on AD on-premises. To achieve this decoupling, virtual networks used for Azure AD DS should not have connection to corporate networks.

   * Follow the guidance of the [credential tiering](https://aka.ms/TierModel). Application Servers are typically considered Tier 1 assets.

 ## Conditional Access Policies

Use Azure AD Conditional Access to interpret signals and make
authentication decisions based on them. For more information, see the
[Conditional Access deployment plan.](https://aka.ms/deploymentplans/ca)

* [Legacy Authentication Protocols](../fundamentals/auth-sync-overview.md): Use Conditional Access to [block legacy authentication](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy.md) protocols whenever possible. Additionally, disable legacy authentication protocols at the application level using application-specific configuration.

   * See specific details for [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/disable-basic-authentication-in-exchange-online#how-basic-authentication-works-in-exchange-online) and [SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps).

* Implement the recommended [Identity and device access configurations.](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide)

* If you are using a version of Azure AD that does not include Conditional Access, ensure that you are using the [Azure AD security defaults](../fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md).

   * For more information on Azure AD feature licensing, see the [Azure AD pricing guide](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).

## Monitoring 

Once you have configured your environment to protect your Microsoft 365
from an on-premises compromise, [proactively monitor](../reports-monitoring/overview-monitoring.md)
the environment.
### Scenarios to Monitor

Monitor the following key scenarios, in addition to any scenarios
specific to your organization. For example, you should proactively
monitor access to your business-critical applications and resources.

* **Suspicious activity**: All [Azure AD risk events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection#risk-detection-and-remediation) should be monitored for suspicious activity. [Azure AD Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection) is natively integrated with Azure Security Center.

   * Define the network [named locations](../reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations.md) to avoid noisy detections on location-based signals. 
*  **User Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA) alerts** Use UEBA
    to get insights on anomaly detection.
   * Microsoft Cloud App Discovery (MCAS) provides [UEBA in the cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/tutorial-ueba).

   * You can [integrate on-premises UEBA from Azure ATP](https://docs.microsoft.com/defender-for-identity/install-step2). MCAS reads signals from Azure AD Identity Protection. 

* **Emergency access accounts activity**: Any access using [emergency access accounts](../roles/security-emergency-access.md) should be monitored and alerts created for investigations. This monitoring must include: 

   * Sign-ins. 

   * Credential management. 

   * Any updates on group memberships. 

   *    Application Assignments. 
* **Privileged role activity**: Configure and review
    security [alerts generated by Azure AD PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-configure-security-alerts?tabs=new#security-alerts).
    Monitor direct assignment of privileged roles outside PIM by
    generating alerts whenever a user is assigned directly.
* **Azure AD tenant-wide configurations**: Any change to tenant-wide configurations should generate alerts in the system. These include but are not limited to
  *  Updating custom domains  

  * Azure AD B2B allow/block list changes.
  * Azure AD B2B allowed identity providers (SAML IDPs through direct federation or social logins).  
  * Conditional Access or Risk policy changes 

* **Application and service principal objects**:
   * New applications or service principals that might require Conditional Access policies. 

   * Additional credentials added to service principals.
   * Application consent activity. 

* **Custom roles**:
   * Updates of the custom role definitions. 

   * New custom roles created. 

### Log Management

Define a log storage and retention strategy, design, and implementation to facilitate a consistent toolset such as SIEM systems like Azure Sentinel, common queries, and investigation and forensics playbooks.

* **Azure AD Logs** Ingest logs and signal produced following consistent best practices, including diagnostics settings, log retention, and SIEM ingestion. The log strategy must include the following Azure AD logs:
   * Sign-in activity 

   * Audit logs 

   * Risk events 

Azure AD provides [Azure Monitor integration](../reports-monitoring/concept-activity-logs-azure-monitor.md) for the sign-in activity log and audit logs. Risk events can be ingested through [Microsoft Graph API](https://aka.ms/AzureADSecuredAzure/32b). You can [stream Azure AD logs to Azure monitor logs](../reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics.md).

* **Hybrid Infrastructure OS Security Logs.** All hybrid identity infrastructure OS logs should be archived and carefully monitored as a <br>Tier 0 system, given the surface area implications. This includes: 

   *  Azure AD Connect. [Azure AD Connect Health](https://aka.ms/AzureADSecuredAzure/32e) must be deployed to monitor identity synchronization.

   *  Application Proxy Agents 


   * Password write-back agents 

   * Password Protection Gateway machines  

   * NPS that have the Azure MFA RADIUS extension
