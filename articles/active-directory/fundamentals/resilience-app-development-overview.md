# Increase resilience of authentication and authorization applications you develop

Microsoft Identity uses modern, token-based authentication and authorization. This means that an application acquires tokens from an Identity provider to authenticate the user and to authorize the application to call protected APIs.

A token is valid for a certain length of time before the app must acquire a new one. Rarely, a call to retrieve a token could fail due to an issue like network or infrastructure failure or authentication service outage. In this document, we outline steps a developer can take to increase resilience in their applications if a token acquisition failure occurs.

These articles provide guidance on increasing resiliency in apps using the Microsoft identity platform and Azure Active Directory. There is guidance for both client applications that work on behalf of a signed in user as well as daemon applications that work on their own behalf. They contain best practices for using tokens as well as calling resources.
