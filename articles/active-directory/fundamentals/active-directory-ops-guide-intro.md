# Azure Active Directory operations reference guide

This operations reference guide describes the checks and actions you should take to secure and maintain the following areas:

- **[Identity and access management](active-directory-ops-guide-iam.md)** - ability to manage the lifecycle of identities and their entitlements.
- **[Authentication management](active-directory-ops-guide-auth.md)** - ability to manage credentials, define authentication experience, delegate assignment, measure usage, and define access policies based on enterprise security posture.
- **[Governance](active-directory-ops-guide-govern.md)** - ability to assess and attest the access granted non-privileged and privileged identities, audit, and control changes to the environment.
- **[Operations](active-directory-ops-guide-ops.md)** - optimize the operations Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Some recommendations here might not be applicable to all customersâ€™ environment, for example, AD FS best practices might not apply if your organization uses password hash sync.

> [!NOTE]
> These recommendations are current as of the date of publishing but can change over time. Organizations should continuously evaluate their identity practices as Microsoft products and services evolve over time. Recommendations can change when organizations subscribe to a different Azure AD Premium license. For example, Azure AD Premium P2 will include more governance recommendations.
