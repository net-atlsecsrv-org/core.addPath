## May 2019

### Service change: Future support for only TLS 1.2 protocols on the Application Proxy service

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

To help provide best-in-class encryption for our customers, we're limiting access to only TLS 1.2 protocols on the Application Proxy service. This change is gradually being rolled out to customers who are already only using TLS 1.2 protocols, so you shouldn't see any changes.

Deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 happens on August 31, 2019, but we'll provide additional advanced notice, so you'll have time to prepare for this change. To prepare for this change make sure your client-server and browser-server combinations, including any clients your users use to access apps published through Application Proxy, are updated to use the TLS 1.2 protocol to maintain the connection to the Application Proxy service. For more information, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#before-you-begin).

### Client apps in request loops will be interrupted to improve reliability and user experience

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Client apps can incorrectly issue hundreds of the same login requests over a short period of time. These requests, whether they're successful or not, all contribute to a poor user experience and heightened workloads for the IDP, increasing latency for all users and reducing the availability of the IDP.

This update sends an `invalid_grant` error: `AADSTS50196: The server terminated an operation because it encountered a loop while processing a request` to client apps that issue duplicate requests multiple times over a short period of time, beyond the scope of normal operation. Client apps that encounter this issue should show an interactive prompt, requiring the user to sign in again. For more information about this change and about how to fix your app if it encounters this error, see [What's new for authentication?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#looping-clients-will-be-interrupted).

### Enhanced combined MFA/SSPR registration

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Self Service Password Reset  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

In response to customer feedback, we’ve enhanced the combined MFA/SSPR registration preview experience, helping your users to more quickly register their security info for both MFA and SSPR. 

**To turn on the enhanced experience for your users' today, follow these steps:**

1. As a global administrator or user administrator, sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**. 

2. In the **Users who can use the preview features for registering and managing security info – refresh** option, choose to turn on the features for a **Selected group of users** or for **All users**.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be removing the ability to turn on the old combined MFA/SSPR registration preview experience for tenants that don’t already have it turned on.

**To see if the control will be removed for your tenant, follow these steps:**

1. As a global administrator or user administrator, sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**.  

2. If the **Users who can use the preview features for registering and managing security info** option is set to **None**, the option will be removed from your tenant.

Regardless of whether you previously turned on the old combined MFA/SSPR registration preview experience for users or not, the old experience will be turned off at a future date. Because of that, we strongly suggest that you move to the new, enhanced experience as soon as possible.

For more information about the enhanced registration experience, see the [Cool enhancements to the Azure AD combined MFA and password reset registration experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Cool-enhancements-to-the-Azure-AD-combined-MFA-and-password/ba-p/354271).

## January 2019

### Active Directory B2B collaboration using one-time passcode authentication (Public preview)

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

We've introduced one-time passcode authentication (OTP) for B2B guest users who can't be authenticated through other means like Azure AD, a Microsoft account (MSA), or Google federation. This new authentication method means that guest users don't have to create a new Microsoft account. Instead, while redeeming an invitation or accessing a shared resource, a guest user can request a temporary code to be sent to an email address. Using this temporary code, the guest user can continue to sign in.

For more information, see [Email one-time passcode authentication (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/one-time-passcode) and the blog, [Azure AD makes sharing and collaboration seamless for any user with any account](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Azure-AD-makes-sharing-and-collaboration-seamless-for-any-user/ba-p/325949).

### New Azure AD Application Proxy cookie settings

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

We've introduced three new cookie settings, available for your apps that are published through Application Proxy:

- **Use HTTP-Only cookie.** Sets the **HTTPOnly** flag on your Application Proxy access and session cookies. Turning on this setting provides additional security benefits, such as helping to prevent copying or modifying of cookies through client-side scripting. We recommend you turn on this flag (choose **Yes**) for the added benefits.

- **Use secure cookie.** Sets the **Secure** flag on your Application Proxy access and session cookies. Turning on this setting provides additional security benefits, by making sure cookies are only transmitted over TLS secure channels, such as HTTPS. We recommend you turn on this flag (choose **Yes**) for the added benefits.

- **Use persistent cookie.** Prevents access cookies from expiring when the web browser is closed. These cookies last for the lifetime of the access token. However, the cookies are reset if the expiration time is reached or if the user manually deletes the cookie. We recommend you keep the default setting **No**, only turning on the setting for older apps that don't share cookies between processes.

For more information about the new cookies, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings).

## November/December 2018

### Users removed from synchronization scope no longer switch to cloud-only accounts

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** User Management  
**Product capability:** Directory

>[!Important]
>We've heard and understand your frustration because of this fix. Therefore, we've reverted this change until such time that we can make the fix easier for you to implement in your organization.

We’ve fixed a bug in which the DirSyncEnabled flag of a user would be erroneously switched to **False** when the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) object was excluded from synchronization scope and then moved to the Recycle Bin in Azure AD on the following sync cycle. As a result of this fix, if the user is excluded from sync scope and afterwards restored from Azure AD Recycle Bin, the user account remains as synchronized from on-premises AD, as expected, and cannot be managed in the cloud since its source of authority (SoA) remains as on-premises AD.

Prior to this fix, there was an issue when the DirSyncEnabled flag was switched to False. It gave the wrong impression that these accounts were converted to cloud-only objects and that the accounts could be managed in the cloud. However, the accounts still retained their SoA as on-premises and all synchronized properties (shadow attributes) coming from on-premises AD. This condition caused multiple issues in Azure AD and other cloud workloads (like Exchange Online) that expected to treat these accounts as synchronized from AD but were now behaving like cloud-only accounts.

At this time, the only way to truly convert a synchronized-from-AD account to cloud-only account is by disabling DirSync at the tenant level, which triggers a backend operation to transfer the SoA. This type of SoA change requires (but is not limited to) cleaning all the on-premises related attributes (such as LastDirSyncTime and shadow attributes) and sending a signal to other cloud workloads to have its respective object converted to a cloud-only account too.

This fix consequently prevents direct updates on the ImmutableID attribute of a user synchronized from AD, which in some scenarios in the past were required. By design, the ImmutableID of an object in Azure AD, as the name implies, is meant to be immutable. New features implemented in Azure AD Connect Health and Azure AD Connect Synchronization client are available to address such scenarios:

- **Large-scale ImmutableID update for many users in a staged approach**
  
  For example, you need to do a lengthy AD DS inter-forest migration. Solution: Use Azure AD Connect to **Configure Source Anchor** and, as the user migrates, copy the existing ImmutableID values from Azure AD into the local AD DS user’s ms-DS-Consistency-Guid attribute of the new forest. For more information, see [Using ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as sourceAnchor](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-connect-design-concepts#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor).

- **Large-scale ImmutableID updates for many users in one shot**

  For example, while implementing Azure AD Connect you make a mistake, and now you need to change the SourceAnchor attribute. Solution: Disable DirSync at the tenant level and clear all the invalid ImmutableID values. For more information, see [Turn off directory synchronization for Office 365](/office365/enterprise/turn-off-directory-synchronization).

- **Rematch on-premises user with an existing user in Azure AD**
  For example, a user that has been re-created in AD DS generates a duplicate in Azure AD account instead of rematching it with an existing Azure AD account (orphaned object). Solution: Use Azure AD Connect Health in the Azure portal to remap the Source Anchor/ImmutableID. For more information, see [Orphaned object scenario](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-diagnose-sync-errors#orphaned-object-scenario).

### Identity Protection improvements to the supervised machine learning model and the risk score engine

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Risk Scores

Improvements to the Identity Protection-related user and sign-in risk assessment engine can help to improve user risk accuracy and coverage. Administrators may notice that user risk level is no longer directly linked to the risk level of specific detections, and that there's an increase in the number and level of risky sign-in events.

Risk detections are now evaluated by the supervised machine learning model, which calculates user risk by using additional features of the user’s sign-ins and a pattern of detections. Based on this model, the administrator might find users with high risk scores, even if detections associated with that user are of low or medium risk.

### Change notice: Authorization codes will no longer be available for reuse 

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting on November 15, 2018, Azure AD will stop accepting previously used authentication codes for apps. This security change helps to bring Azure AD in line with the OAuth specification and will be enforced on both the v1 and v2 endpoints.

If your app reuses authorization codes to get tokens for multiple resources, we recommend that you use the code to get a refresh token, and then use that refresh token to acquire additional tokens for other resources. Authorization codes can only be used once, but refresh tokens can be used multiple times across multiple resources. An app that attempts to reuse an authentication code during the OAuth code flow will get an invalid_grant error.

For this and other protocols-related changes, see [the full list of what's new for authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes).

## August 2018

### Changes to Azure Active Directory IP address ranges

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Platform

We're introducing larger IP ranges to Azure AD, which means if you've configured Azure AD IP address ranges for your firewalls, routers, or Network Security Groups, you'll need to update them. We're making this update so you won't have to change your firewall, router, or Network Security Groups IP range configurations again when Azure AD adds new endpoints. 

Network traffic is moving to these new ranges over the next two months. To continue with uninterrupted service, you must add these updated values to your IP Addresses before September 10, 2018:

- 20.190.128.0/18 

- 40.126.0.0/18 

We strongly recommend not removing the old IP Address ranges until all of your network traffic has moved to the new ranges. For updates about the move and to learn when you can remove the old ranges, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).

### Change notice: Authorization codes will no longer be available for reuse 

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting on November 15, 2018, Azure AD will stop accepting previously used authentication codes for apps. This security change helps to bring Azure AD in line with the OAuth specification and will be enforced on both the v1 and v2 endpoints.

If your app reuses authorization codes to get tokens for multiple resources, we recommend that you use the code to get a refresh token, and then use that refresh token to acquire additional tokens for other resources. Authorization codes can only be used once, but refresh tokens can be used multiple times across multiple resources. An app that attempts to reuse an authentication code during the OAuth code flow will get an invalid_grant error.

### Converged security info management for self-service password (SSPR) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** SSPR  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
This new feature helps people manage their security info (such as, phone number, mobile app, and so on) for SSPR and MFA in a single location and experience; as compared to previously, where it was done in two different locations.

This converged experience also works for people using either SSPR or MFA. Additionally, if your organization doesn't enforce MFA or SSPR registration, people can still register any MFA or SSPR security info methods allowed by your organization from the My Apps portal.

This is an opt-in public preview. Administrators can turn on the new experience (if desired) for a selected group or for all users in a tenant. For more information about the converged experience, see the [Converged experience blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/08/06/mfa-and-sspr-updates-now-in-public-preview/)

### New HTTP-Only cookies setting in Azure AD Application proxy apps

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

There's a new setting called, **HTTP-Only Cookies** in your Application Proxy apps. This setting helps provide extra security by including the HTTPOnly flag in the HTTP response header for both Application Proxy access and session cookies, stopping access to the cookie from a client-side script and further preventing actions like copying or modifying the cookie. Although this flag hasn't been used previously, your cookies have always been encrypted and transmitted using an SSL connection to help protect against improper modifications.

This setting isn't compatible with apps using ActiveX controls, such as Remote Desktop. If you're in this situation, we recommend that you turn off this setting.

For more information about the HTTP-Only Cookies setting, see [Publish applications using Azure AD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-publish-azure-portal).

### Application access (preview) provides faster access to the Azure AD portal

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Today, when activating a role using PIM, it can take over 10 minutes for the permissions to take effect. If you choose to use Application access, which is currently in public preview, administrators can access the Azure AD portal as soon as the activation request completes.

Currently, Application access only supports the Azure AD portal experience and Azure resources. For more information about PIM and Application access, see [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)

### Change notice: Security fix to the delegated authorization flow for apps using Azure AD Activity Logs API

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

Due to our stronger security enforcement, we’ve had to make a change to the permissions for apps that use a delegated authorization flow to access [Azure AD Activity Logs APIs](https://aka.ms/aadreportsapi). This change will occur by **June 26, 2018**.

If any of your apps use Azure AD Activity Log APIs, follow these steps to ensure the app doesn’t break after the change happens.

**To update your app permissions**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **App Registrations**.
2. Select your app that uses the Azure AD Activity Logs API, select **Settings**, select **Required permissions**, and then select the **Windows Azure Active Directory** API.
3. In the **Delegated permissions** area of the **Enable access** blade, select the box next to **Read directory** data, and then select **Save**.
4. Select **Grant permissions**, and then select **Yes**.
    
    >[!Note]
    >You must be a Global administrator to grant permissions to the app.

For more information, see the [Grant permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-api-prerequisites-azure-portal#grant-permissions) area of the Prerequisites to access the Azure AD reporting API article.

### Configure TLS settings to connect to Azure AD services for PCI DSS compliance

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications and is the most widely deployed security protocol used today.

The [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) has determined that early versions of TLS and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) must be disabled in favor of enabling new and more secure app protocols, with compliance starting on **June 30, 2018**. This change means that if you connect to Azure AD services and require PCI DSS-compliance, you must disable TLS 1.0. Multiple versions of TLS are available, but TLS 1.2 is the latest version available for Azure Active Directory Services. We highly recommend moving directly to TLS 1.2 for both client/server and browser/server combinations.

Out-of-date browsers might not support newer TLS versions, such as TLS 1.2. To see which versions of TLS are supported by your browser, go to the [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) site and click **Test your browser**. We recommend you upgrade to the latest version of your web browser and preferably enable only TLS 1.2.

**To enable TLS 1.2, by browser**

- **Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer (both are set using Internet Explorer)**

    1. Open Internet Explorer, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**.
    2. In the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    3. Close all browser windows and restart Internet Explorer. 

- **Google Chrome**

    1. Open Google Chrome, type *chrome://settings/* into the address bar, and press **Enter**.
    2. Expand the **Advanced** options, go to the **System** area, and select **Open proxy settings**.
    3. In the **Internet Properties** box, select the **Advanced** tab, go to the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    4. Close all browser windows and restart Google Chrome.

- **Mozilla Firefox**

    1. Open Firefox, type *about:config* into the address bar, and then press **Enter**.
    2. Search for the term, *TLS*, and then select the **security.tls.version.max** entry.
    3. Set the value to **3** to force the browser to use up to version TLS 1.2, and then select **OK**.

        >[!NOTE]
        >Firefox version 60.0 supports TLS 1.3, so you can also set the security.tls.version.max value to **4**.

    4. Close all browser windows and restart Mozilla Firefox.

## May 2018

### ExpressRoute support changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform  

Software as a Service offering, like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are designed to work best by going directly through the Internet, without requiring ExpressRoute or any other private VPN tunnels. Because of this, on **August 1, 2018**, we will stop supporting ExpressRoute for Azure AD services using Azure public peering and Azure communities in Microsoft peering. Any services impacted by this change might notice Azure AD traffic gradually shifting from ExpressRoute to the Internet.

While we're changing our support, we also know there are still situations where you might need to use a dedicated set of circuits for your authentication traffic. Because of this, Azure AD will continue to support per-tenant IP range restrictions using ExpressRoute and services already on Microsoft peering with the "Other Office 365 Online services" community. If your services are impacted, but you require ExpressRoute, you must do the following:

- **If you're on Azure public peering.** Move to Microsoft peering and sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online services (12076:5100)** community. For more info about how to move from Azure public peering to Microsoft peering, see the [Move a public peering to Microsoft peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/how-to-move-peering) article.

- **If you're on Microsoft peering.** Sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. For more info about routing requirements, see the [Support for BGP communities section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing#bgp) of the ExpressRoute routing requirements article.

If you must continue to use dedicated circuits, you'll need to talk to your Microsoft Account team about how to get authorization to use the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. The MS Office-managed review board will verify whether you need those circuits and make sure you understand the technical implications of keeping them. Unauthorized subscriptions trying to create route filters for Office 365 will receive an error message.

**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

**Just in time redemption:** Once you share a resource with a guest user using B2B API – you don’t need to send out a special invitation email. In most      cases, the guest user can access the resource and will be taken through the redemption experience just in time. No more impact due to missed emails. No more asking your guest users “Did you click on that redemption link the system sent you?”. This means once SPO uses the invitation manager – cloudy attachments can have the same canonical URL for all users – internal and external – in any state of redemption.

**Modern redemption experience:** No more split screen redemption landing page. Users will see a modern consent experience with the inviting organization's privacy statement, just like they do for third-party apps.

**Guest users can leave the org:** Once a user’s relationship with an org is over, they can self-serve leaving the organization. No more calling the inviting org’s admin to “be removed”, no more raising support tickets.

### ID tokens can no longer be returned using the query response_mode for new apps. 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Apps created on or after April 25, 2018 will no longer be able to request an **id_token** using the **query** response_mode.  This brings Azure AD inline with the OIDC specifications and helps reduce your apps attack surface.  Apps created before April 25, 2018 are not blocked from using the **query** response_mode with a response_type of **id_token**.  The error returned, when requesting an id_token from AAD, is **AADSTS70007: ‘query’ is not a supported value of ‘response_mode’ when requesting a token**.

The **fragment** and **form_post** response_modes continue to work - when creating new application objects (for example, for App Proxy usage), ensure use of one of these response_modes before they create a new application.

### Faster performance of Azure AD automatic user provisioning to SaaS applications

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** 3rd Party Integration
 
Previously, customers using the Azure Active Directory user provisioning connectors for SaaS applications (for example Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Box) could experience slow performance if their Azure AD tenants contained over 100,000 combined users and groups, and they were using user and group assignments to determine which users should be provisioned.

On April 2, 2018, significant performance enhancements were deployed to the Azure AD provisioning service that greatly reduce the amount of time needed to perform initial synchronizations between Azure Active Directory and target SaaS applications.

As a result, many customers that had initial synchronizations to apps that took many days or never completed, are now completing within a matter of minutes or hours.

### Changing group membership from dynamic to static, and vice versa

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration
 
It is possible to change how membership is managed in a group. This is useful when you want to keep the same group name and ID in the system, so any existing references to the group are still valid; creating a new group would require updating those references.

### Access reviews

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Access reviews  
**Product capability:** Compliance  

Organizations can use access reviews (preview) to efficiently manage group memberships and access to enterprise applications: 

- You can recertify guest user access by using access reviews of their access to applications and memberships of groups. Reviewers can efficiently decide whether to allow guests continued access based on the insights provided by the access reviews.

### Hide third-party applications from My Apps and the Office 365 app launcher

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** My Apps  
**Product capability:** Single sign-on  

You now can better manage apps that show up on your users' portals through a new **hide app** property. You can hide apps to help in cases where app tiles show up for back-end services or duplicate tiles and clutter users' app launchers. The toggle is in the **Properties** section of the third-party app and is labeled **Visible to user?** You also can hide an app programmatically through PowerShell. 

For more information, see [Hide a third-party application from a user's experience in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-coreapps-hide-third-party-app). 


**What's available?**

 As part of the transition to the new admin console, two new APIs for retrieving Azure AD activity logs are available. The new set of APIs provides richer filtering and sorting functionality in addition to providing richer audit and sign-in activities. The data previously available through the security reports now can be accessed through the Identity Protection Risk Detections API in Microsoft Graph.
