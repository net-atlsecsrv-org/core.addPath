## May 2020

### Retirement of properties in signIns, riskyUsers, and riskDetections APIs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Currently, enumerated types are used to represent the riskType property in both the riskDetections API and riskyUserHistoryItem (in preview). Enumerated types are also used for the riskEventTypes property in the signIns API. Going forward we will represent these properties as strings. 

Customers should transition to the riskEventType property in the beta riskDetections and riskyUserHistoryItem API, and to riskEventTypes_v2 property in the beta signIns API by September 9th, 2020. At that date, we will be retiring the current riskType and riskEventTypes properties. For more information, refer to [Changes to risk event properties and Identity Protection APIs on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/changes-to-risk-event-properties-and-identity-protection-apis-on-microsoft-graph/).

--- 

### Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Enumerated types will switch to string types when representing risk event properties in Microsoft Graph September 2020. In addition to impacting the preview APIs, this change will also impact the in-production signIns API.

We have introduced a new riskEventsTypes_v2 (string) property to the signIns v1.0 API. We will retire the current riskEventTypes (enum) property on June 11, 2022 in accordance with our Microsoft Graph deprecation policy. Customers should transition to the riskEventTypes_v2 property in the v1.0  signIns API by June 11, 2022. For more information, refer to [Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/deprecation-of-riskeventtypes-property-in-signins-v1-0-api-on-microsoft-graph//).

--- 

### Upcoming changes to MFA email notifications

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We are making the following changes to the email notifications for cloud MFA:

E-mail notifications will be sent from the following address: azure-noreply@microsoft.com and msonlineservicesteam@microsoftonline.com. We're updating the content of fraud alert emails to better indicate the required steps to unblock uses.

---

### New self-service sign up for users in federated domains who can't access Microsoft Teams because they aren't synced to Azure Active Directory.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 

Currently, users who are in domains federated in Azure AD, but who are not synced into the tenant, can't access Teams. Starting at the end of June, this new capability will enable them to do so by extending the existing email verified sign up feature. This will allow users who can sign in to a federated IdP, but who don't yet have a user object in Azure ID, to have a user object created automatically and be authenticated for Teams. Their user object will be marked as "self-service sign up." This is an extension of the existing capability to do email verified self-sign up that users in managed domains can do and can be controlled using the same flag. This change will complete rolling out during the following two months. Watch for documentation updates [here](../enterprise-users/directory-self-service-signup.md).
 
---

### Upcoming fix: The OIDC discovery document for the Azure Government cloud is being updated to reference the correct Graph endpoints.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting in June, the OIDC discovery document [Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocol](../develop/v2-protocols-oidc.md) on the [Azure Government cloud](../develop/authentication-national-cloud.md) endpoint (login.microsoftonline.us), will begin to return the correct [National cloud graph](/graph/deployments) endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.us or https://dod-graph.microsoft.us), based on the tenant provided.  It currently provides the incorrect Graph endpoint (graph.microsoft.com) "msgraph_host" field.  

This bug fix will be rolled out gradually over approximately 2 months.  

---

### Azure Government users will no longer be able to sign in on login.microsoftonline.com

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
On 1 June 2018, the official Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authority for Azure Government changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us. If you own an application within an Azure Government tenant, you must update your application to sign users in on the .us endpoint.

Starting May 5th, Azure AD will begin enforcing the endpoint change, blocking Azure Government users from signing into apps hosted in Azure Government tenants using the public endpoint (microsoftonline.com). Impacted apps will begin seeing an error AADSTS900439 - USGClientNotSupportedOnPublicEndpoint. 

There will be a gradual rollout of this change with enforcement expected to be complete across all apps June 2020. For more details, please see the [Azure Government blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-government-aad-authority-endpoint-update/).

### SAML Single Logout request now sends NameID in the correct format

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
When a user clicks on sign-out (e.g., in the MyApps portal), Azure AD sends a SAML Single Logout message to each app that is active in the user session and has a Logout URL configured. These messages contain a NameID in a persistent format.

If the original SAML sign-in token used a different format for NameID (e.g. email/UPN), then the SAML app cannot correlate the NameID in the logout message to an existing session (as the NameIDs used in both messages are different), which caused the logout message to be discarded by the SAML app and the user to stay logged in. This fix makes the sign-out message consistent with the NameID configured for the application.

---

### Hybrid Identity Administrator role is now available with Cloud Provisioning

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
IT Admins can start using the new "Hybrid Admin" role as the least privileged role for setting up Azure ADConnect Cloud Provisioning. With this new role, you no longer have to use the Global Admin role to setup and configure Cloud Provisioning. [Learn more](../roles/delegate-by-task.md#connect).

**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

[Report-only mode for Azure AD Conditional Access](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only.md) lets you evaluate the result of a policy without enforcing access controls. You can test report-only policies across your organization and understand their impact before enabling them, making deployment safer and easier. Over the past few months, we’ve seen strong adoption of report-only mode—over 26M users are already in scope of a report-only policy. With the announcement today, new Azure AD Conditional Access policies will be created in report-only mode by default. This means you can monitor the impact of your policies from the moment they’re created. And for those of you who use the MS Graph APIs, you can [manage report-only policies programmatically](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-beta) as well.

### Self-service sign up for guest users

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
With External Identities in Azure AD, you can allow people outside your organization to access your apps and resources while letting them sign in using whatever identity they prefer. When sharing an application with external users, you might not always know in advance who will need access to the application. With [self-service sign-up](../external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview.md), you can enable guest users to sign up and gain a guest account for your line of business (LOB) apps. The sign-up flow can be created and customized to support Azure AD and social identities. You can also collect additional information about the user during sign-up.

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Authentication 
**Product capability:** Developer Experience

Because of modern browser [3rd party cookie restrictions such as Safari ITP](../develop/reference-third-party-cookies-spas.md), SPAs will have to use the authorization code flow rather than the implicit flow to maintain SSO; MSAL.js v 2.x will now support the authorization code flow. There as corresponding updates to the Azure portal so you can update your SPA to be type "spa" and use the auth code flow. For guidance, refer to [Quickstart: Sign in users and get an access token in a JavaScript SPA using the auth code flow](../develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code.md).

### The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available

**Type:** Changed Feature   
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available. 

Previously, you had to manage your B2C consumer-facing applications separately from the rest of your apps using the legacy 'Applications' experience. That meant different app creation experiences across different places in Azure.

The new experience shows all B2C app registrations and Azure AD app registrations in one place and provides a consistent way to manage them. Whether you need to manage a customer-facing app or an app that has access to Microsoft Graph to programmatically manage Azure AD B2C resources, you only need to learn one way to do things.

You can reach the new experience by navigating the Azure AD B2C service and selecting the App registrations blade. The experience is also accessible from the Azure Active Directory service.

The Azure AD B2C App registrations experience is based on the general [App Registration experience](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/new-app-registrations-experience-is-now-generally-available/) for Azure AD tenants but is tailored for Azure AD B2C. The legacy "Applications" experience will be deprecated in the future.

For more information, visit [The New app registration experience for Azure AD B2C](../../active-directory-b2c/app-registrations-training-guide.md).

### SMS Sign-in: Firstline Workers can sign in to Azure AD-backed applications with their phone number and no password

**Type:** New feature

**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)

**Product capability:** User Authentication

Office is launching a series of mobile-first business apps that cater to non-traditional organizations, and to employees in large organizations that don’t use email as their primary communication method. These apps target frontline employees, deskless workers, field agents, or retail employees that may not get an email address from their employer, have access to a computer, or to IT. This project will let these employees sign in to business applications by entering a phone number and roundtripping a code. For more details, please see our [admin documentation](../authentication/howto-authentication-sms-signin.md) and [end user documentation](../user-help/sms-sign-in-explainer.md).

### Invite internal users to use B2B collaboration

**Type:** New feature

**Service category:** B2B

**Product capability:**

We're expanding B2B invitation capability to allow existing internal accounts to be invited to use B2B collaboration credentials going forward. This is done by passing the user object to the Invite API in addition to typical parameters like the invited email address. The user's object ID, UPN, group membership, app assignment, etc. remain intact, but going forward they'll use B2B to authenticate with their home tenant credentials rather than the internal credentials they used before the invitation. For details, see the [documentation](../external-identities/invite-internal-users.md).

### Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps now support the latest versions of Workday Web Services API

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** 

Based on customer feedback, we have now updated the Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps in the enterprise app gallery to support the latest versions of the Workday Web Services (WWS) API. With this change, customers can specify the WWS API version that they would like to use in the connection string. This gives customers the ability to retrieve more HR attributes available in the releases of Workday. The Workday Writeback app now uses the recommended Change_Work_Contact_Info Workday web service to overcome the limitations of Maintain_Contact_Info.

If no version is specified in the connection string, by default, the Workday inbound provisioning apps will continue to use WWS v21.1  To switch to the latest Workday APIs for inbound user provisioning, customers need to update the connection string as documented [in the tutorial](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#which-workday-apis-does-the-solution-use-to-query-and-update-workday-worker-profiles) and also update the XPATHs used for Workday attributes as documented in the [Workday attribute reference guide](../app-provisioning/workday-attribute-reference.md#xpath-values-for-workday-web-services-wws-api-v30). 

To use the new API for writeback, there are no changes required in the Workday Writeback provisioning app. On the Workday side, ensure that the Workday Integration System User (ISU) account has permissions to invoke the Change_Work_Contact business process as documented in the tutorial section, [Configure business process security policy permissions](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#configuring-business-process-security-policy-permissions). 

We have updated our [tutorial guide](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md) to reflect the new API version support.

### Users with default access role are now in scope for provisioning

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

Historically, users with the default access role have been out of scope for provisioning. We've heard feedback that customers want users with this role to be in scope for provisioning. As of April 16, 2020, all new provisioning configurations allow users with the default access role to be provisioned. Gradually we will change the behavior for existing provisioning configurations to support provisioning users with this role. [Learn more.](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-no-users-provisioned.md)

### Dynamic Group rule validation is now available for Public Preview

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** Group Management

**Product capability:** Collaboration

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) now provides the means to validate dynamic group rules. On the **Validate rules** tab, you can validate your dynamic rule against sample group members to confirm the rule is working as expected. When creating or updating dynamic group rules, administrators want to know whether a user or a device will be a member of the group. This helps evaluate whether a user or device meets the rule criteria and aids in troubleshooting when membership is not expected.

For more information, see [Validate a dynamic group membership rule (preview)](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-rule-validation.md).

### Identity Secure Score - Security Defaults and MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** N/A

**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

**Supporting security defaults for Azure AD improvement actions:** Microsoft Secure Score will be updating improvement actions to support [security defaults in Azure AD](./concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md), which make it easier to help protect your organization with pre-configured security settings for common attacks. This will affect the following improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles
- Enable policy to block legacy authentication
 
**MFA improvement action updates:** To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score has removed three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication and added two.

Removed improvement actions:

- Register all users for multi-factor authentication
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

Added improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions require registering your users or admins for multi-factor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. That can take the form of having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions, or setting security defaults (as of March 16th) that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA.

### SSPR (self-service password reset) now requires two gates for admins in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Self-Service Password Reset  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
Previously in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet), admins using self-service password reset (SSPR) to reset their own passwords needed only one "gate" (challenge) to prove their identity. In public and other national clouds, admins generally must use two gates to prove their identity when using SSPR. But because we didn't support SMS or phone calls in Azure China 21Vianet, we allowed one-gate password reset by admins.

We're creating SSPR feature parity between Azure China 21Vianet and the public cloud. Going forward, admins must use two gates when using SSPR. SMS, phone calls, and Authenticator app notifications and codes will be supported. [Learn more](../authentication/concept-sspr-policy.md#administrator-reset-policy-differences).

### Password length is limited to 256 characters

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
To ensure the reliability of the Azure AD service, user passwords are now limited in length to 256 characters. Users with passwords longer than this will be asked to change their password on subsequent login, either by contacting their admin or by using the self-service password reset feature.

This change was enabled on March 13th, 2020, at 10AM PST (18:00 UTC), and the error is AADSTS 50052, InvalidPasswordExceedsMaxLength. See the [breaking change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#user-passwords-will-be-restricted-to-256-characters) for more details.

### Deprecation of Directory-wide groups option from Groups General Settings on Azure portal

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

To provide a more flexible way for customers to create directory-wide groups that best meet their needs, we've replaced the **Directory-wide Groups** option from the **Groups** > **General** settings in the Azure portal with a link to [dynamic group documentation](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership.md). We've improved our documentation to include more instructions so administrators can create all-user groups that include or exclude guest users.

---

## February 2020

### Upcoming changes to custom controls

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
We're planning to replace the current custom controls preview with an approach that allows partner-provided authentication capabilities to work seamlessly with the Azure Active Directory administrator and end user experiences. Today, partner MFA solutions face the following limitations: they work only after a password has been entered; they don't serve as MFA for step-up authentication in other key scenarios; and they don't integrate with end user or administrative credential management functions. The new implementation will allow partner-provided authentication factors to work alongside built-in factors for key scenarios, including registration, usage, MFA claims, step up authentication, reporting, and logging. 

Custom controls will continue to be supported in preview alongside the new design until it reaches general availability. At that point, we'll give customers time to migrate to the new design. Because of the limitations of the current approach, we won't onboard new providers until the new design is available. We are working closely with customers and providers and will communicate the timeline as we get closer. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696#).

### Identity Secure Score - MFA improvement action updates

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score is removing three improvement actions centered around multi-factor authentication (MFA), and adding two.

The following improvement actions will be removed:

- Register all users for MFA
- Require MFA for all users
- Require MFA for Azure AD privileged roles

The following improvement actions will be added:

- Ensure all users can complete MFA for secure access
- Require MFA for administrative roles

These new improvement actions will require registering your users or admins for MFA across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. This can take the form of setting security defaults that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for MFA, or having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions. As part of these improvement action updates, Baseline protection policies will no longer be included in scoring calculations. [Read more about what's coming in Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score-whats-coming).

### Azure AD Domain Services SKU selection

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services
 
We've heard feedback that Azure AD Domain Services customers want more flexibility in selecting performance levels for their instances. Starting on February 1, 2020, we switched from a dynamic model (where Azure AD determines the performance and pricing tier based on object count) to a self-selection model. Now customers can choose a performance tier that matches their environment. This change also allows us to enable new scenarios like Resource Forests, and Premium features like daily backups. The object count is now unlimited for all SKUs, but we'll continue to offer object count suggestions for each tier.

**No immediate customer action is required.** For existing customers, the dynamic tier that was in use on February 1, 2020, determines the new default tier. There is no pricing or performance impact as the result of this change. Going forward, Azure AD DS customers will need to evaluate performance requirements as their directory size and workload characteristics change. Switching between service tiers will continue to be a no-downtime operation, and we will no longer automatically move customers to new tiers based on the growth of their directory. Furthermore, there will be no price increases, and new pricing will align with our current billing model. For more information, see the [Azure AD DS SKUs documentation](../../active-directory-domain-services/administration-concepts.md#azure-ad-ds-skus) and the [Azure AD Domain Services pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/).

### Azure AD support for FIDO2 security keys in hybrid environments

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
We're announcing the public preview of Azure AD support for FIDO2 security keys in Hybrid environments. Users can now use FIDO2 security keys to sign in to their Hybrid Azure AD joined Windows 10 devices and get seamless sign-on to their on-premises and cloud resources. Support for Hybrid environments has been the top most-requested feature from our passwordless customers since we initially launched the public preview for FIDO2 support in Azure AD joined devices.

### Replacement of baseline policies with security defaults

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Identity Security and Protection

As part of a secure-by-default model for authentication, we're removing the existing baseline protection policies from all tenants. This removal is targeted for completion at the end of February.

## November 2019

### Support for the SameSite attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

As part of a secure-by-default model for cookies, the Chrome 80 browser is changing how it treats cookies without the `SameSite` attribute. Any cookie that doesn't specify the `SameSite` attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`, which will result in Chrome blocking certain cross-domain cookie sharing scenarios that your app may depend on. To maintain the older Chrome behavior, you can use the `SameSite=None` attribute and add an additional `Secure` attribute, so cross-site cookies can only be accessed over HTTPS connections. Chrome is scheduled to complete this change by February 4, 2020.

We recommend all our developers test their apps using this guidance:

- Set the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Set the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

- Add an additional `SameSite` attribute of **Secure**.

For more information, see [Upcoming SameSite Cookie Changes in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/upcoming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-asp-net-and-asp-net-core/) and [Potential disruption to customer websites and Microsoft products and services in Chrome version 79 and later](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4522904/potential-disruption-to-microsoft-services-in-chrome-beta-version-79).

### Application Proxy support for the SameSite Attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

A couple of weeks prior to the Chrome 80 browser release, we plan to update how Application Proxy cookies treat the **SameSite** attribute. With the release of Chrome 80, any cookie that doesn't specify the **SameSite** attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`.

To help avoid potentially negative impacts due to this change, we're updating Application Proxy access and session cookies by:

- Setting the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Setting the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Application Proxy access cookies have always been transmitted exclusively over secure channels. These changes only apply to session cookies.

For more information about the Application Proxy cookie settings, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings.md).

### New Azure AD Global Reader role

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Azure AD roles
**Product capability:** Access Control

Starting on September 24, 2019, we're going to start rolling out a new Azure Active Directory (AD) role called Global Reader. This rollout will start with production and Global cloud customers (GCC), finishing up worldwide in October.

The Global Reader role is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services, but can't take management actions. We've created the Global Reader role to help reduce the number of Global Administrators in your organization. Because Global Administrator accounts are powerful and vulnerable to attack, we recommend that you have fewer than five Global Administrators. We recommend using the Global Reader role for planning, audits, or investigations. We also recommend using the Global Reader role in combination with other limited administrator roles, like Exchange Administrator, to help get work done without requiring the Global Administrator role.

The Global Reader role works with the new Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Exchange Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, Security Center, Compliance Center, Azure AD Admin Center, and the Device Management Admin Center.

>[!NOTE]
> At the start of public preview, the Global Reader role won't work with: SharePoint, Privileged Access Management, Customer Lockbox, sensitivity labels, Teams Lifecycle, Teams Reporting & Call Analytics, Teams IP Phone Device Management, and Teams App Catalog.

For more information, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

### ADAL.NET ignores the MSAL.NET shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios

**Type:** Fixed
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting with Azure AD authentication library (ADAL.NET) version 5.0.0-preview, app developers must [serialize one cache per account for web apps and web APIs](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Token-cache-serialization#custom-token-cache-serialization-in-web-applications--web-api). Otherwise, some scenarios using the [on-behalf-of flow](../develop/scenario-web-api-call-api-app-configuration.md?tabs=java) for Java, along with some specific use cases of `UserAssertion`, may result in an elevation of privilege. To avoid this vulnerability, ADAL.NET now ignores the Microsoft Authentication Library for dotnet (MSAL.NET) shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios.

For more information about this issue, see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1258).

### Plan for change: Application Proxy service update to support only TLS 1.2

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

To help provide you with our strongest encryption, we're going to begin limiting Application Proxy service access to only TLS 1.2 protocols. This limitation will initially be rolled out to customers who are already using TLS 1.2 protocols, so you won't see the impact. Complete deprecation of the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols will be complete on August 31, 2019. Customers still using TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will receive advanced notice to prepare for this change.

To maintain the connection to the Application Proxy service throughout this change, we recommend that you make sure your client-server and browser-server combinations are updated to use TLS 1.2. We also recommend that you make sure to include any client systems used by your employees to access apps published through the Application Proxy service.

For more information, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).

On July 26, 2019, we changed how we provide app-only tokens through the [client credentials grant](../azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md). Previously, apps could get tokens to call other apps, regardless of whether the client app was in the tenant. We've updated this behavior so single-tenant resources, sometimes called Web APIs, can only be called by client apps that exist in the resource tenant.

If your app isn't located in the resource tenant, you'll get an error message that says, `The service principal named <app_name> was not found in the tenant named <tenant_name>. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant.` To fix this problem, you must create the client app service principal in the tenant, using either the [admin consent endpoint](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#using-the-admin-consent-endpoint) or [through PowerShell](../develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md), which ensures your tenant has given the app permission to operate within the tenant.

For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#app-only-tokens-for-single-tenant-applications-are-only-issued-if-the-client-app-exists-in-the-resource-tenant).

> [!NOTE]
> Existing consent between the client and the API continues to not be required. Apps should still be doing their own authorization checks.

### Azure AD now supports static query parameters in reply (redirect) URIs

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Azure AD apps can now register and use reply (redirect) URIs with static query parameters (for example, `https://contoso.com/oauth2?idp=microsoft`) for OAuth 2.0 requests. The static query parameter is subject to string matching for reply URIs, just like any other part of the reply URI. If there's no registered string that matches the URL-decoded redirect-uri, the request is rejected. If the reply URI is found, the entire string is used to redirect the user, including the static query parameter.

Dynamic reply URIs are still forbidden because they represent a security risk and can't be used to retain state information across an authentication request. For this purpose, use the `state` parameter.

Currently, the app registration screens of the Azure portal still block query parameters. However, you can manually edit the app manifest to add and test query parameters in your app. For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#redirect-uris-can-now-contain-query-string-parameters).

### Service change: Future support for only TLS 1.2 protocols on the Application Proxy service

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

To help provide best-in-class encryption for our customers, we're limiting access to only TLS 1.2 protocols on the Application Proxy service. This change is gradually being rolled out to customers who are already only using TLS 1.2 protocols, so you shouldn't see any changes.

### Client apps in request loops will be interrupted to improve reliability and user experience

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Client apps can incorrectly issue hundreds of the same login requests over a short period of time. These requests, whether they're successful or not, all contribute to a poor user experience and heightened workloads for the IDP, increasing latency for all users and reducing the availability of the IDP.

This update sends an `invalid_grant` error: `AADSTS50196: The server terminated an operation because it encountered a loop while processing a request` to client apps that issue duplicate requests multiple times over a short period of time, beyond the scope of normal operation. Client apps that encounter this issue should show an interactive prompt, requiring the user to sign in again. For more information about this change and about how to fix your app if it encounters this error, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#looping-clients-will-be-interrupted).

### Enhanced combined MFA/SSPR registration

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Self Service Password Reset
**Product capability:** User Authentication

In response to customer feedback, we've enhanced the combined MFA/SSPR registration preview experience, helping your users to more quickly register their security info for both MFA and SSPR.

**To turn on the enhanced experience for your users' today, follow these steps:**

1. As a global administrator or user administrator, sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**.

2. In the **Users who can use the preview features for registering and managing security info – refresh** option, choose to turn on the features for a **Selected group of users** or for **All users**.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be removing the ability to turn on the old combined MFA/SSPR registration preview experience for tenants that don't already have it turned on.

**To see if the control will be removed for your tenant, follow these steps:**

1. As a global administrator or user administrator, sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**.

2. If the **Users who can use the preview features for registering and managing security info** option is set to **None**, the option will be removed from your tenant.

Regardless of whether you previously turned on the old combined MFA/SSPR registration preview experience for users or not, the old experience will be turned off at a future date. Because of that, we strongly suggest that you move to the new, enhanced experience as soon as possible.

For more information about the enhanced registration experience, see the [Cool enhancements to the Azure AD combined MFA and password reset registration experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Cool-enhancements-to-the-Azure-AD-combined-MFA-and-password/ba-p/354271).

## January 2019

### Active Directory B2B collaboration using one-time passcode authentication (Public preview)

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** B2B
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

We've introduced one-time passcode authentication (OTP) for B2B guest users who can't be authenticated through other means like Azure AD, a Microsoft account (MSA), or Google federation. This new authentication method means that guest users don't have to create a new Microsoft account. Instead, while redeeming an invitation or accessing a shared resource, a guest user can request a temporary code to be sent to an email address. Using this temporary code, the guest user can continue to sign in.

For more information, see [Email one-time passcode authentication (preview)](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) and the blog, [Azure AD makes sharing and collaboration seamless for any user with any account](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Azure-AD-makes-sharing-and-collaboration-seamless-for-any-user/ba-p/325949).

### New Azure AD Application Proxy cookie settings

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

We've introduced three new cookie settings, available for your apps that are published through Application Proxy:

- **Use HTTP-Only cookie.** Sets the **HTTPOnly** flag on your Application Proxy access and session cookies. Turning on this setting provides additional security benefits, such as helping to prevent copying or modifying of cookies through client-side scripting. We recommend you turn on this flag (choose **Yes**) for the added benefits.

- **Use secure cookie.** Sets the **Secure** flag on your Application Proxy access and session cookies. Turning on this setting provides additional security benefits, by making sure cookies are only transmitted over TLS secure channels, such as HTTPS. We recommend you turn on this flag (choose **Yes**) for the added benefits.

- **Use persistent cookie.** Prevents access cookies from expiring when the web browser is closed. These cookies last for the lifetime of the access token. However, the cookies are reset if the expiration time is reached or if the user manually deletes the cookie. We recommend you keep the default setting **No**, only turning on the setting for older apps that don't share cookies between processes.

For more information about the new cookies, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings.md).

>[!Important]
>We've heard and understand your frustration because of this fix. Therefore, we've reverted this change until such time that we can make the fix easier for you to implement in your organization.

We've fixed a bug in which the DirSyncEnabled flag of a user would be erroneously switched to **False** when the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) object was excluded from synchronization scope and then moved to the Recycle Bin in Azure AD on the following sync cycle. As a result of this fix, if the user is excluded from sync scope and afterwards restored from Azure AD Recycle Bin, the user account remains as synchronized from on-premises AD, as expected, and cannot be managed in the cloud since its source of authority (SoA) remains as on-premises AD.

Prior to this fix, there was an issue when the DirSyncEnabled flag was switched to False. It gave the wrong impression that these accounts were converted to cloud-only objects and that the accounts could be managed in the cloud. However, the accounts still retained their SoA as on-premises and all synchronized properties (shadow attributes) coming from on-premises AD. This condition caused multiple issues in Azure AD and other cloud workloads (like Exchange Online) that expected to treat these accounts as synchronized from AD but were now behaving like cloud-only accounts.

At this time, the only way to truly convert a synchronized-from-AD account to cloud-only account is by disabling DirSync at the tenant level, which triggers a backend operation to transfer the SoA. This type of SoA change requires (but is not limited to) cleaning all the on-premises related attributes (such as LastDirSyncTime and shadow attributes) and sending a signal to other cloud workloads to have its respective object converted to a cloud-only account too.

This fix consequently prevents direct updates on the ImmutableID attribute of a user synchronized from AD, which in some scenarios in the past were required. By design, the ImmutableID of an object in Azure AD, as the name implies, is meant to be immutable. New features implemented in Azure AD Connect Health and Azure AD Connect Synchronization client are available to address such scenarios:

- **Large-scale ImmutableID update for many users in a staged approach**

  For example, you need to do a lengthy AD DS inter-forest migration. Solution: Use Azure AD Connect to **Configure Source Anchor** and, as the user migrates, copy the existing ImmutableID values from Azure AD into the local AD DS user's ms-DS-Consistency-Guid attribute of the new forest. For more information, see [Using ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as sourceAnchor](../hybrid/plan-connect-design-concepts.md#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor).

- **Large-scale ImmutableID updates for many users in one shot**

  For example, while implementing Azure AD Connect you make a mistake, and now you need to change the SourceAnchor attribute. Solution: Disable DirSync at the tenant level and clear all the invalid ImmutableID values. For more information, see [Turn off directory synchronization for Office 365](/office365/enterprise/turn-off-directory-synchronization).

- **Rematch on-premises user with an existing user in Azure AD**
  For example, a user that has been re-created in AD DS generates a duplicate in Azure AD account instead of rematching it with an existing Azure AD account (orphaned object). Solution: Use Azure AD Connect Health in the Azure portal to remap the Source Anchor/ImmutableID. For more information, see [Orphaned object scenario](../hybrid/how-to-connect-health-diagnose-sync-errors.md#orphaned-object-scenario).

### Breaking Change: Updates to the audit and sign-in logs schema through Azure Monitor

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Reporting

### Identity Protection improvements to the supervised machine learning model and the risk score engine

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Identity Protection
**Product capability:** Risk Scores

Improvements to the Identity Protection-related user and sign-in risk assessment engine can help to improve user risk accuracy and coverage. Administrators may notice that user risk level is no longer directly linked to the risk level of specific detections, and that there's an increase in the number and level of risky sign-in events.

Risk detections are now evaluated by the supervised machine learning model, which calculates user risk by using additional features of the user's sign-ins and a pattern of detections. Based on this model, the administrator might find users with high risk scores, even if detections associated with that user are of low or medium risk.

### Change notice: Authorization codes will no longer be available for reuse

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting on November 15, 2018, Azure AD will stop accepting previously used authentication codes for apps. This security change helps to bring Azure AD in line with the OAuth specification and will be enforced on both the v1 and v2 endpoints.

If your app reuses authorization codes to get tokens for multiple resources, we recommend that you use the code to get a refresh token, and then use that refresh token to acquire additional tokens for other resources. Authorization codes can only be used once, but refresh tokens can be used multiple times across multiple resources. An app that attempts to reuse an authentication code during the OAuth code flow will get an invalid_grant error.

For this and other protocols-related changes, see [the full list of what's new for authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md).

---

### New Federated Apps available in Azure AD app gallery - September 2018

## August 2018

### Changes to Azure Active Directory IP address ranges

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Other
**Product capability:** Platform

We're introducing larger IP ranges to Azure AD, which means if you've configured Azure AD IP address ranges for your firewalls, routers, or Network Security Groups, you'll need to update them. We're making this update so you won't have to change your firewall, router, or Network Security Groups IP range configurations again when Azure AD adds new endpoints.

Network traffic is moving to these new ranges over the next two months. To continue with uninterrupted service, you must add these updated values to your IP Addresses before September 10, 2018:

- 20.190.128.0/18

- 40.126.0.0/18

We strongly recommend not removing the old IP Address ranges until all of your network traffic has moved to the new ranges. For updates about the move and to learn when you can remove the old ranges, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).

### Converged security info management for self-service password (SSPR) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** SSPR
**Product capability:** User Authentication

This new feature helps people manage their security info (such as, phone number, mobile app, and so on) for SSPR and MFA in a single location and experience; as compared to previously, where it was done in two different locations.

This converged experience also works for people using either SSPR or MFA. Additionally, if your organization doesn't enforce MFA or SSPR registration, people can still register any MFA or SSPR security info methods allowed by your organization from the My Apps portal.

This is an opt-in public preview. Administrators can turn on the new experience (if desired) for a selected group or for all users in a tenant. For more information about the converged experience, see the [Converged experience blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/08/06/mfa-and-sspr-updates-now-in-public-preview/)

---

### New HTTP-Only cookies setting in Azure AD Application proxy apps

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

There's a new setting called, **HTTP-Only Cookies** in your Application Proxy apps. This setting helps provide extra security by including the HTTPOnly flag in the HTTP response header for both Application Proxy access and session cookies, stopping access to the cookie from a client-side script and further preventing actions like copying or modifying the cookie. Although this flag hasn't been used previously, your cookies have always been encrypted and transmitted using a TLS connection to help protect against improper modifications.

This setting isn't compatible with apps using ActiveX controls, such as Remote Desktop. If you're in this situation, we recommend that you turn off this setting.

For more information about the HTTP-Only Cookies setting, see [Publish applications using Azure AD Application Proxy](../manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).

---

### Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure resources supports Management Group resource types

**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management

Just-In-Time activation and assignment settings can now be applied to Management Group resource types, just like you already do for Subscriptions, Resource Groups, and Resources (such as VMs, App Services, and more). In addition, anyone with a role that provides administrator access for a Management Group can discover and manage that resource in PIM.

For more information about PIM and Azure resources, see [Discover and manage Azure resources by using Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-discover-resources.md)

---

### Application access (preview) provides faster access to the Azure AD portal

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management

Today, when activating a role using PIM, it can take over 10 minutes for the permissions to take effect. If you choose to use Application access, which is currently in public preview, administrators can access the Azure AD portal as soon as the activation request completes.

Currently, Application access only supports the Azure AD portal experience and Azure resources. For more information about PIM and Application access, see [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](../privileged-identity-management/pim-configure.md)

## June 2018

### Change notice: Security fix to the delegated authorization flow for apps using Azure AD Activity Logs API

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Reporting
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

Due to our stronger security enforcement, we've had to make a change to the permissions for apps that use a delegated authorization flow to access [Azure AD Activity Logs APIs](../reports-monitoring/concept-reporting-api.md). This change will occur by **June 26, 2018**.

If any of your apps use Azure AD Activity Log APIs, follow these steps to ensure the app doesn't break after the change happens.

**To update your app permissions**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **App Registrations**.
2. Select your app that uses the Azure AD Activity Logs API, select **Settings**, select **Required permissions**, and then select the **Windows Azure Active Directory** API.
3. In the **Delegated permissions** area of the **Enable access** blade, select the box next to **Read directory** data, and then select **Save**.
4. Select **Grant permissions**, and then select **Yes**.

    >[!Note]
    >You must be a Global administrator to grant permissions to the app.

### Configure TLS settings to connect to Azure AD services for PCI DSS compliance

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** N/A
**Product capability:** Platform

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications and is the most widely deployed security protocol used today.

The [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) has determined that early versions of TLS and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) must be disabled in favor of enabling new and more secure app protocols, with compliance starting on **June 30, 2018**. This change means that if you connect to Azure AD services and require PCI DSS-compliance, you must disable TLS 1.0. Multiple versions of TLS are available, but TLS 1.2 is the latest version available for Azure Active Directory Services. We highly recommend moving directly to TLS 1.2 for both client/server and browser/server combinations.

Out-of-date browsers might not support newer TLS versions, such as TLS 1.2. To see which versions of TLS are supported by your browser, go to the [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) site and click **Test your browser**. We recommend you upgrade to the latest version of your web browser and preferably enable only TLS 1.2.

**To enable TLS 1.2, by browser**

- **Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer (both are set using Internet Explorer)**

    1. Open Internet Explorer, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**.
    2. In the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    3. Close all browser windows and restart Internet Explorer.

- **Google Chrome**

    1. Open Google Chrome, type *chrome://settings/* into the address bar, and press **Enter**.
    2. Expand the **Advanced** options, go to the **System** area, and select **Open proxy settings**.
    3. In the **Internet Properties** box, select the **Advanced** tab, go to the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    4. Close all browser windows and restart Google Chrome.

- **Mozilla Firefox**

    1. Open Firefox, type *about:config* into the address bar, and then press **Enter**.
    2. Search for the term, *TLS*, and then select the **security.tls.version.max** entry.
    3. Set the value to **3** to force the browser to use up to version TLS 1.2, and then select **OK**.

        >[!NOTE]
        >Firefox version 60.0 supports TLS 1.3, so you can also set the security.tls.version.max value to **4**.

    4. Close all browser windows and restart Mozilla Firefox.

## May 2018

### ExpressRoute support changes

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** Platform

Software as a Service offering, like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are designed to work best by going directly through the Internet, without requiring ExpressRoute or any other private VPN tunnels. Because of this, on **August 1, 2018**, we will stop supporting ExpressRoute for Azure AD services using Azure public peering and Azure communities in Microsoft peering. Any services impacted by this change might notice Azure AD traffic gradually shifting from ExpressRoute to the Internet.

While we're changing our support, we also know there are still situations where you might need to use a dedicated set of circuits for your authentication traffic. Because of this, Azure AD will continue to support per-tenant IP range restrictions using ExpressRoute and services already on Microsoft peering with the "Other Office 365 Online services" community. If your services are impacted, but you require ExpressRoute, you must do the following:

- **If you're on Azure public peering.** Move to Microsoft peering and sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online services (12076:5100)** community. For more info about how to move from Azure public peering to Microsoft peering, see the [Move a public peering to Microsoft peering](../../expressroute/how-to-move-peering.md) article.

- **If you're on Microsoft peering.** Sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. For more info about routing requirements, see the [Support for BGP communities section](../../expressroute/expressroute-routing.md#bgp) of the ExpressRoute routing requirements article.

If you must continue to use dedicated circuits, you'll need to talk to your Microsoft Account team about how to get authorization to use the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. The MS Office-managed review board will verify whether you need those circuits and make sure you understand the technical implications of keeping them. Unauthorized subscriptions trying to create route filters for Office 365 will receive an error message.

### Improvements to the B2B redemption experience and leave an org

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** B2B
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

**Just in time redemption:** Once you share a resource with a guest user using B2B API – you don't need to send out a special invitation email. In most      cases, the guest user can access the resource and will be taken through the redemption experience just in time. No more impact due to missed emails. No more asking your guest users "Did you click on that redemption link the system sent you?". This means once SPO uses the invitation manager – cloudy attachments can have the same canonical URL for all users – internal and external – in any state of redemption.

**Modern redemption experience:** No more split screen redemption landing page. Users will see a modern consent experience with the inviting organization's privacy statement, just like they do for third-party apps.

**Guest users can leave the org:** Once a user's relationship with an org is over, they can self-serve leaving the organization. No more calling the inviting org's admin to "be removed", no more raising support tickets.

### ID tokens can no longer be returned using the query response_mode for new apps.

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Apps created on or after April 25, 2018 will no longer be able to request an **id_token** using the **query** response_mode.  This brings Azure AD inline with the OIDC specifications and helps reduce your apps attack surface.  Apps created before April 25, 2018 are not blocked from using the **query** response_mode with a response_type of **id_token**.  The error returned, when requesting an id_token from Azure AD, is **AADSTS70007: 'query' is not a supported value of 'response_mode' when requesting a token**.

The **fragment** and **form_post** response_modes continue to work - when creating new application objects (for example, for App Proxy usage), ensure use of one of these response_modes before they create a new application.

### Faster performance of Azure AD automatic user provisioning to SaaS applications

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** App Provisioning
**Product capability:** 3rd Party Integration

Previously, customers using the Azure Active Directory user provisioning connectors for SaaS applications (for example Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Box) could experience slow performance if their Azure AD tenants contained over 100,000 combined users and groups, and they were using user and group assignments to determine which users should be provisioned.

On April 2, 2018, significant performance enhancements were deployed to the Azure AD provisioning service that greatly reduce the amount of time needed to perform initial synchronizations between Azure Active Directory and target SaaS applications.

As a result, many customers that had initial synchronizations to apps that took many days or never completed, are now completing within a matter of minutes or hours.
