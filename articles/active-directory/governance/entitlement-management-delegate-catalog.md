# Delegate access governance to catalog creators in Azure AD entitlement management

A catalog is a container of resources and access packages. You create a catalog when you want to group related resources and access packages. By default, a Global administrator or a User administrator can [create a catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md), and can add additional users as catalog owners.

To delegate to users who aren't administrators, so that they can create their own catalogs, you can add those users to the Azure AD entitlement management-defined catalog creator role. You can add individual users, or you can add a group, whose members are then able to create catalogs.  After creating a catalog, they can subsequently add resources they own to their catalog.

## As an IT administrator, delegate to a catalog creator

Follow these steps to assign a user to the catalog creator role.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator or User administrator

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity Governance**.

1. In the left menu, in the **Entitlement management** section, click **Settings**.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. In the **Delegate entitlement management** section, click **Add catalog creators** to select the users or groups that you want to delegate this entitlement management role to.

1. Click **Select**.

1. Click **Save**.

## Allow delegated roles to access the Azure portal

To allow delegated roles, such as catalog creators and access package managers, to access the Azure portal to manage access packages, you should check the administration portal setting.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator or User administrator

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Users**.

1. In the left menu, click **User settings**.

1. Make sure **Restrict access to Azure AD administration portal** is set to **No**.
