# Common scenarios in Azure AD entitlement management

There are several ways that you can configure entitlement management for your organization. However, if you're just getting started, it's helpful to understand the common scenarios for administrators, catalog owners, access package managers, approvers, and requestors.

## Delegate

### Administrator: Delegate management of resources

1. [Watch video: Delegation from IT to department manager](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE3Lq00)
1. [Delegate users to catalog creator role](entitlement-management-delegate-catalog.md)

### Catalog creator: Delegate management of resources

- [Create a new catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md#create-a-catalog)

### Catalog owner: Delegate management of resources

1. [Add co-owners to the catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md#add-additional-catalog-owners)
1. [Add resources to the catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md#add-resources-to-a-catalog)

### Catalog owner: Delegate management of access packages

1. [Watch video: Delegation from catalog owner to access package manager](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE3Lq08)
1. [Delegate users to access package manager role](entitlement-management-delegate-managers.md)

## Govern access for users in your organization

### Access package manager: Allow employees in your organization to request access to resources

1. [Create a new access package](entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#start-new-access-package)
1. [Add groups, Teams, applications, or SharePoint sites to access package](entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles)
1. [Add a request policy to allow users in your directory to request access](entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#for-users-in-your-directory)
1. [Specify expiration settings](entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#lifecycle)

### Requestor: Request access to resources

1. [Sign in to the My Access portal](entitlement-management-request-access.md#sign-in-to-the-my-access-portal)
1. Find access package
1. [Request access](entitlement-management-request-access.md#request-an-access-package)

### Approver: Approve requests to resources

1. [Open request in My Access portal](entitlement-management-request-approve.md#open-request)
1. [Approve or deny access request](entitlement-management-request-approve.md#approve-or-deny-request)

### Requestor: View the resources you already have access to

1. [Sign in to the My Access portal](entitlement-management-request-access.md#sign-in-to-the-my-access-portal)

## Programmatic administration

You can also manage access packages, catalogs, policies, requests and assignments using Microsoft Graph.  A user in an appropriate role with an application that has the delegated `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` permission can call the [entitlement management API](/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-root?view=graph-rest-beta).
