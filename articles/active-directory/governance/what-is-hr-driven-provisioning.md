# What is HR driven provisioning?

![HR provisioning](./media/what-is-hr-driven-provisioning/cloud2a.png)

HR driven provisioning is the process of creating digital identities based on a human resources system.  The HR systems, become the start-of-authority for these newly created digital identities and is often the starting point for numerous provisioning processes.  For example, if a new employee joins your company, they are created in the human resource system.  The creation, triggers the provisioning of a user account into Active Directory and then Azure AD Connect provisions this account to Azure AD, etc.

HR driven provisioning can be either on-premises based or cloud based.

## On-premises based HR provisioning
On-premises based HR provisioning is accomplished by using a local HR system and a means of provisioning new digital identities.

HR systems come in a variety of packages, software bundles and may use SQL servers, LDAP directories, etc.

Currently, Microsoft on-premises HR provisioning solutions use Microsoft Identity Manager to trigger provisioning when a new identity is created in these HR systems.

Using MIM, you can provision users from your on-premises HR systems to Active Directory or Azure AD.

For information on Microsoft Identity Manager and the systems it supports see the [Microsoft Identity Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-identity-manager/microsoft-identity-manager-2016) documentation.
