# Hide or delete an access package in Azure AD entitlement management

Access packages are discoverable by default. This means that if a policy allows a user to request the access package, they will automatically see the access package listed in their My Access portal. However, you can change the **Hidden** setting so that the access package is not listed in user's My Access portal.

This article describes how to hide or delete an access package.

## Change the Hidden setting

Follow these steps to change the **Hidden** setting for an access package.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator, User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity Governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. On the Overview page, click **Edit**.

1. Set the **Hidden** setting.

    If set to **No**, the access package will be listed in the user's My Access portal.

    If set to **Yes**, the access package will not be listed in the user's My Access portal. The only way a user can view the access package is if they have the direct **My Access portal link** to the access package. For more information, see [Share link to request an access package](entitlement-management-access-package-settings.md).

## Delete an access package

An access package can only be deleted if it has no active user assignments. Follow these steps to delete an access package.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator, User administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity Governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Access packages** and then open the access package.

1. In the left menu, click **Assignments** and remove access for all users.
