# Add a connected organization in Azure AD entitlement management

Azure AD entitlement management enables you to collaborate with people outside your organization. If you frequently collaborate with users in an external Azure AD directory or domain, you can add them as a connected organization. This article describes how to add a connected organization so that you can allow users outside your organization to request resources in your directory.

## What is a connected organization?

A connected organization is an external Azure AD directory or domain that you have a relationship with.

For example, suppose you work at Woodgrove Bank and you want to collaborate with two external organizations. These two organizations have different configurations:

- Graphic Design Institute uses Azure AD and their users have a user principal name that ends with `graphicdesigninstitute.com`
- Contoso does not yet use Azure AD. Contoso users have a user principal name that ends with `contoso.com`.

In this case, you can configure two connected organizations. You would create one connected organization for Graphic Design Institute and one for Contoso. If you then add those two connected organizations to a policy, users from each organization with a user principal name matching the policy can request access packages. Users with a user principal name that has a domain of graphicdesigninstitute.com would match the Graphic Design Institute connected organization and be allowed to submit requests, while users with a user principal name that has a domain of contoso.com would match the Contoso connected organization and would also be allowed to request packages. Furthermore, because Graphic Design Institute uses Azure AD, any users with a principal name matching a [verified domain](../fundamentals/add-custom-domain.md#verify-your-custom-domain-name) added to their tenant, such as graphicdesigninstitute.example will also be able to request access packages using the same policy.

How users from the Azure AD directory or domain will authenticate depends on the authentication type. The authentication types for connected organizations are the following:

- Azure AD
- [Direct federation](../b2b/direct-federation.md)
- [One-time passcode](../b2b/one-time-passcode.md) (domain)

## Add a connected organization

Follow these steps to add an external Azure AD directory or domain as a connected organization.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator, User administrator, or Guest inviter

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity Governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Connected organizations** and then click **Add connected organization**.

    ![Identity Governance - Connected organizations - Add connected organization](./media/entitlement-management-organization/connected-organization.png)

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter a display name and description for the organization.

    ![Add connected organization - Basics tab](./media/entitlement-management-organization/organization-basics.png)

1. On the **Directory + domain** tab, click **Add directory + domain** to open the Select directories + domains pane.

1. Type a domain name to search for the Azure AD directory or domain. You must type the entire domain name.

1. Verify it is the correct organization by the provided name and authentication type. How users will sign in depends on the authentication type.

    ![Add connected organization - Select directories + domains](./media/entitlement-management-organization/organization-select-directories-domains.png)

1. Click **Add** to add the Azure AD directory or domain. Currently, you can only add one Azure AD directory or domain per connected organization.

    > [!NOTE]
    > All users from the Azure AD directory or domain will be able to request this access package. This includes users in Azure AD from all subdomains associated with the directory, unless those domains are blocked by the Azure B2B allow or deny list. For more information, see [Allow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations](../b2b/allow-deny-list.md).

1. Once you have added the Azure AD directory or domain, click **Select**.

    The organization appears in the list.

    ![Add connected organization - Directories tab](./media/entitlement-management-organization/organization-directory-domain.png)

1. On the **Sponsors** tab, add optional sponsors for this connected organization.

    Sponsors are internal or external users already in your directory that are the point of contact for the relationship with this connected organization. Internal sponsors are member users in your directory. External sponsors are guest users from the connected organization that were previously invited and are already in your directory. Sponsors can be utilized as approvers when users in this connected organization request access to this access package. For information about how to invite a guest user to your directory, see [Add Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration users in the Azure portal](../b2b/add-users-administrator.md).

    When you click **Add/Remove**, a pane appears to select the internal or external sponsors. The pane displays an unfiltered list of users and groups in your directory.

1. On the **Review + create** tab, review your organization settings and then click **Create**.

## Update a connected organization 

If the connected organization changes to a different domain, if you have a new name for that organization, or you wish to change the sponsors, you can update the connected organization.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator, User administrator, or Guest inviter

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity Governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Connected organizations** and then click to open the connected organization.

1. On the Overview page, click **Edit** to change the organization name or description.  

1. On the Directory + domain page, click **Update directory + domain** to change to a different directory or domain.

1. On the Sponsors page, click **Add internal sponsors** or **Add external sponsors** to add a user as a sponsor.  To remove a sponsor, click on the sponsor and on the menu on the right, click **Delete**.


## Delete a connected organization

If you no longer have a relationship with an external Azure AD directory or domain, you can delete the connected organization.

**Prerequisite role:** Global administrator, User administrator, or Guest inviter

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** and then click **Identity Governance**.

1. In the left menu, click **Connected organizations** and then click to open the connected organization.

1. On the Overview page, click **Delete** to delete the connected organization.

    Currently, you can only delete a connected organization if there are no connected users.
