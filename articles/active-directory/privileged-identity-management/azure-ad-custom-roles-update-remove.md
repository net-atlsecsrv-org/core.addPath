# Update or remove an assigned Azure AD custom role in Privileged Identity Management

This article tells you how to use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to update or remove just-in-time and time-bound assignment to custom roles created for application management in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrative experience. 

- For more information about creating custom roles to delegate application management in Azure AD, see [Custom administrator roles in Azure Active Directory (preview)](../roles/custom-overview.md). 
- If you haven't used Privileged Identity Management yet, get more information at [Start using Privileged Identity Management](pim-getting-started.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD custom roles are not integrated with the built-in directory roles during preview. Once the capability is generally available, role management will take place in the built-in roles experience. If you see the following banner, these roles should be managed [in the built-in roles experience](pim-how-to-add-role-to-user.md) and this article does not apply:
