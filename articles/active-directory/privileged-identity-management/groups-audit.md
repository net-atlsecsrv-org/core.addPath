# Audit activity history for privileged access group assignments (preview) in Privileged Identity Management

With Privileged Identity Management (PIM), you can view activity, activations, and audit history for Azure privileged access group members and owners within your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who uses [Azure delegated resource management](../../lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management.md), role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here.

Follow these steps to view the audit history for privileged access groups.

1. Select **Privileged access groups (Preview)**.

1. Select the privileged access group you want to view audit history for.

1. Under **Activity**, select **Resource audit**.

1. Filter the history using a predefined date or custom range.
