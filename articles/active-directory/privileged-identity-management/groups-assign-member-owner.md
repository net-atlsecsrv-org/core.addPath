# Assign eligibility for a privileged access group (preview) in Privileged Identity Management

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can help you manage the eligibility and activation of assignments to privileged access groups in Azure AD. You can assign eligibility to members or owners of the group.

>[!NOTE]
>Every user who is eligible for membership in or ownership of a privileged access group must have an Azure AD Premium P2 license. For more information, see [License requirements to use Privileged Identity Management](subscription-requirements.md).

## Assign an owner or member of a group

Follow these steps to make a user eligible to be a member or owner of a privileged access group.

1. [Sign in to Azure AD](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with Global Administrator or group Owner permissions.
1. Select **Groups** and then select the role-assignable group you want to manage. You can search or filter the list.

1. In the **Assignment type** list, select **Eligible** or **Active**. Privileged access groups provide two distinct assignment types:

    - **Eligible** assignments require the member of the role to perform an action to use the role. Actions might include performing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) check, providing a business justification, or requesting approval from designated approvers.

    - **Active** assignments don't require the member to perform any action to use the role. Members assigned as active have the privileges assigned to the role at all times.

1. If the assignment should be permanent (permanently eligible or permanently assigned), select the **Permanently** checkbox. Depending on your organization's settings, the check box might not appear or might not be editable.

1. When finished, select **Assign**.

1. To create the new role assignment, select **Add**. A notification of the status is displayed.
