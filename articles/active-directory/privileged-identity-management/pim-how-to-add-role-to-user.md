# Assign Azure AD roles in PIM

With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a Global administrator can make **permanent** Azure AD admin role assignments. These role assignments can be created using the [Azure portal](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) or using [PowerShell commands](/powershell/module/azuread#directory_roles).

The Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) service also allows Privileged Role Administrators to make permanent admin role assignments. Additionally, Privileged Role Administrators can make users **eligible** for Azure AD admin roles. An eligible administrator can activate the role when they need it, and then their permissions expire once they're done.

## Make a user eligible for a role

Follow these steps to make a user eligible for an Azure AD admin role.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with a user that is a member of the [Privileged Role Administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md#privileged-role-administrator) role.

    For information about how to grant another administrator access to manage PIM, see [Grant access to other administrators to manage PIM](pim-how-to-give-access-to-pim.md).

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

    If you haven't started PIM in the Azure portal yet, go to [Start using PIM](pim-getting-started.md).

1. Click **Azure AD roles**.

1. Click **Roles** or **Members**.

    ![Azure AD roles](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-directory-roles.png)

1. Click **Add member** to open Add managed members.

1. Click **Select a role**, click a role you want to manage, and then click **Select**.

    ![Select a role](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-select-a-role.png)

1. Click **Select members**, select the users you want to assign to the role, and then click **Select**.

    ![Select a role](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-select-members.png)

1. In Add managed members, click **OK** to add the user to the role.

1. In the list of roles, click the role you just assigned to see the list of members.

     When the role is assigned, the user you selected will appear in the members list as **Eligible** for the role.

    ![User eligible for a role](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-directory-role-eligible.png)

1. Now that the user is eligible for the role, let them know that they can activate it according to the instructions in [Activate my Azure AD roles in PIM](pim-how-to-activate-role.md).

    Eligible administrators are asked to register for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) during activation. If a user cannot register for MFA, or is using a Microsoft account (usually @outlook.com), you need to make them permanent in all their roles.

## Make a role assignment permanent

By default, new users are only Eligible for an Azure AD admin role. Follow these steps if you want to make a role assignment permanent.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Click **Azure AD roles**.

1. Click **Members**.

    ![List of members](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-directory-role-list-members.png)

1. Click an **Eligible** role that you want to make permanent.

1. Click **More** and then click **Make perm**.

    ![Make role assignment permanent](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-make-perm.png)

    The role is now listed as **permanent**.

    ![List of members with permanent change](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-directory-role-list-members-permanent.png)

## Remove a user from a role

You can remove users from role assignments, but make sure there is always at least one user who is a permanent Global Administrator. If you're not sure which users still need their role assignments, you can [start an access review for the role](pim-how-to-start-security-review.md).

Follow these steps to remove a specific user from an Azure AD admin role.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Click **Azure AD roles**.

1. Click **Members**.

    ![List of members](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-directory-role-list-members.png)

1. Click a role assignment you want to remove.

1. Click **More** and then click **Remove**.

    ![Remove a role](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-remove-role.png)

1. In the message that asks you to confirm, click **Yes**.

    ![Remove a role](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/pim-remove-role-confirm.png)

    The role assignment is removed.

## Authorization error when assigning roles

If you recently enabled PIM for a subscription and you get an authorization error when you try to make a user eligible for an Azure AD admin role, it might be because the MS-PIM service principle does not yet have the appropriate permissions. The MS-PIM service principle must have the [User Access Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role to assign roles to others. Instead of waiting until MS-PIM is assigned the User Access Administrator role, you can assign it manually.

Follow these steps to assign the User Access Administrator role to the MS-PIM service principal for a subscription.

1. Sign into the Azure portal as a Global Administrator.

1. Choose **All services** and then **Subscriptions**.

1. Choose your subscription.

1. Choose **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Choose **Role assignments** to see the current list of role assignments at the subscription scope.

   ![Access control (IAM) blade for a subscription](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/ms-pim-access-control.png)

1. Check whether the **MS-PIM** service principal is assigned the **User Access Administrator** role.

1. If not, choose **Add role assignment** to open the **Add role assignment** pane.

1. In the **Role** drop-down list, select the **User Access Administrator** role.

1. In the **Select** list, find and select the **MS-PIM** service principal.

   ![Add permissions for MS-PIM](./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/ms-pim-add-permissions.png)

1. Choose **Save** to assign the role.

   After a few moments, the MS-PIM service principal is assigned the User Access Administrator role at the subscription scope.
