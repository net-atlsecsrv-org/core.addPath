# Assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can manage the built-in Azure resource roles, as well as custom roles, including (but not limited to):

- Owner
- User Access Administrator
- Contributor
- Security Admin
- Security Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Users or members of a group assigned to the Owner or User Access Administrator subscription roles, and Azure AD Global administrators that enable subscription management in Azure AD have Resource administrator permissions by default. These administrators can assign roles, configure role settings, and review access using Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources. A user can't manage Privileged Identity Management for Resources without Resource administrator permissions. View the list of [built-in roles for Azure resources](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

## Assign a role

Follow these steps to make a user eligible for an Azure resource role.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with a user that is a member of the [Privileged role administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md#privileged-role-administrator) role.

    For information about how to grant another administrator access to manage Privileged Identity Management, see [Grant access to other administrators to manage Privileged Identity Management](pim-how-to-give-access-to-pim.md).

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

1. Use the **Resource filter** to filter the list of managed resources.

1. Select the resource you want to manage, such as a subscription or management group.

1. Under Manage, select **Roles** to see the list of roles for Azure resources.

1. Select **Add member** to open the New assignment pane.

1. Select **Select a role** to open the Select a role pane.

    ![Select a member or group pane](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-select-member-or-group.png)

    The Membership settings pane opens.

1. In the **Assignment type** list, select **Eligible** or **Active**.

    ![Memberships settings pane](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-membership-settings-type.png)

    Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources provides two distinct assignment types:

    - **Eligible** assignments require the member of the role to perform an action to use the role. Actions might include performing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) check, providing a business justification, or requesting approval from designated approvers.

    - **Active** assignments don't require the member to perform any action to use the role. Members assigned as active have the privileges assigned to the role at all times.

1. If the assignment should be permanent (permanently eligible or permanently assigned), select the **Permanently** checkbox.

    Depending on the role settings, the check box might not appear or might be unmodifiable.

1. To specify a specific assignment duration, clear the check box and modify the start and/or end date and time boxes.

1. When finished, select **Done**.

    ![New assignment - Add](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-new-assignment-add.png)

1. To create the new role assignment, select **Add**. A notification of the status is displayed.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

1. Select the resource you want to manage, such as a subscription or management group.

1. Under Manage, select **Roles** to see the list of roles for Azure resources.

    ![Azure resource roles - Select role](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-update-select-role.png)
