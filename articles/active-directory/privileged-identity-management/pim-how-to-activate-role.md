# Activate my Azure AD roles in PIM

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) simplifies how enterprises manage privileged access to resources in Azure AD and other Microsoft online services like Office 365 or Microsoft Intune.  

If you have been made eligible for an administrative role, that means you can activate that role when you need to perform privileged actions. For example, if you occasionally manage Office 365 features, your organization's privileged role administrators may not make you a permanent Global Administrator, since that role impacts other services, too. Instead, they make you eligible for Azure AD roles such as Exchange Online Administrator. You can request to activate that role when you need its privileges, and then you'll have administrator control for a predetermined time period.

This article is for administrators who need to activate their Azure AD role in Privileged Identity Management.

## Determine your version of PIM

Beginning in November 2019, the Azure AD roles portion of Privileged Identity Management is being updated to a new version that matches the experiences for Azure resource roles. This creates additional features as well as [changes to the existing API](azure-ad-roles-features.md#api-changes). While the new version is being rolled out, which procedures that you follow in this article depend on version of Privileged Identity Management you currently have. Follow the steps in this section to determine which version of Privileged Identity Management you have. After you know your version of Privileged Identity Management, you can select the procedures in this article that match that version.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the [Privileged role administrator](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md#privileged-role-administrator) role.
1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**. If you have a banner on the top of the overview page, follow the instructions in the **New version** tab of this article. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the **Previous version** tab.

# [New version](#tab/new)

## Activate a role

When you need to assume an Azure AD role, you can request activation by using the **My roles** navigation option in Privileged Identity Management.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**. For information about how to add the Privileged Identity Management tile to your dashboard, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](pim-getting-started.md).

1. Select **My roles**, and then select **Azure AD roles** to see a list of your eligible Azure AD roles.

    ![My roles page showing roles you can activate](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/my-roles.png)

1. In the **Azure AD roles** list, find the role you want to activate.

    ![Azure AD roles - My eligible roles list](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/activate-link.png)

1. Select **Activate** to open the Activate pane.

    ![Azure AD roles - activation page contains duration and scope](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/activate-page.png)

1. If your role requires multi-factor authentication, select **Verify your identity before proceeding**. You only have to authenticate once per session.

    ![Verify my identity with MFA before role activation](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles-mfa.png)

1. Select **Verify my identity** and follow the instructions to provide additional security verification.

    ![Screen to provide security verification such as a PIN code](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-mfa-enter-code.png)

1. If you want to specify a reduced scope, select **Scope** to open the filter pane. On the filter pane, you can specify the Azure AD resources that you need access to. It's a best practice to request access to only the resources you need.

1. If necessary, specify a custom activation start time. The Azure AD role would be activated after the selected time.

1. In the **Reason** box, enter the reason for the activation request.

1. Select **Activate**.

    If the role does not require approval, it is activated and added to the list of active roles. If you want to use the role, follow the steps in next section.

    ![Completed Activate pane with scope, start time, duration, and reason](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/azure-ad-activation-status.png)

    If the [role requires approval](pim-resource-roles-approval-workflow.md) to activate, a notification will appear in the upper right corner of your browser informing you the request is pending approval.

    ![Activation request is pending approval notification](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles-activate-notification.png)

## Use a role immediately after activation

In case of any delay after activation, follow these steps after you activate to use your Azure AD roles immediately.

1. Open Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

1. Select **My roles** to see a list of your eligible Azure AD roles and Azure resource roles.

1. Select **Azure AD roles**.

1. Select the **Active roles** tab.

1. Once the role is active, sign out of the portal and sign back in.

    The role should now be available to use.

## View the status of your requests

You can view the status of your pending requests to activate.

1. Open Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

1. Select **My requests** to see a list of your Azure AD role and Azure resource role requests.

    ![My requests - Azure AD page showing your pending requests](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/my-requests-page.png)

1. Scroll to the right to view the **Request Status** column.

## Cancel a pending request

If you do not require activation of a role that requires approval, you can cancel a pending request at any time.

1. Open Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

1. Select **My requests**.

1. For the role that you want to cancel, select the **Cancel** link.

    When you select Cancel, the request will be canceled. To activate the role again, you will have to submit a new request for activation.

## Troubleshoot

### Permissions are not granted after activating a role

When you activate a role in Privileged Identity Management, the activation may not instantly propagate to all portals that require the privileged role. Sometimes, even if the change is propagated, web caching in a portal may result in the change not taking effect immediately. If your activation is delayed, here is what you should do.

1. Sign out of the Azure portal and then sign back in.

    When you activate an Azure AD role, you will see the stages of your activation. Once all the stages are complete, you will see a **Sign out** link. You can use this link to sign out. This will solve most cases for activation delay.

1. In Privileged Identity Management, verify that you are listed as the member of the role.
