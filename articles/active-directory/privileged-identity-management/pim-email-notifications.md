# Email notifications in PIM

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) lets you know when important events occur in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization, such as when a role is assigned or activated. Privileged Identity Management keeps you informed by sending you and other participants email notifications. These emails might also include links to relevant tasks, such activating or renewing a role. This article describes what these emails look like, when they are sent, and who receives them.

## Sender email address and subject line

Emails sent from Privileged Identity Management for both Azure AD and Azure resource roles have the following sender email address:

- Email address:  **azure-noreply\@microsoft.com**
- Display name: Microsoft Azure

These emails include a **PIM** prefix in the subject line. Here's an example:

- PIM: Alain Charon was permanently assigned the Backup Reader role

## Notifications for Azure AD roles

Privileged Identity Management sends emails when the following events occur for Azure AD roles:

- When a privileged role activation is pending approval
- When a privileged role activation request is completed
- When Azure AD Privileged Identity Management is enabled

Who receives these emails for Azure AD roles depends on your role, the event, and the notifications setting:

| User | Role activation is pending approval | Role activation request is completed | PIM is enabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Privileged Role Administrator</br>(Activated/Eligible) | Yes</br>(only if no explicit approvers are specified) | Yes* | Yes |
| Security Administrator</br>(Activated/Eligible) | No | Yes* | Yes |
| Global Administrator</br>(Activated/Eligible) | No | Yes* | Yes |

\* If the [**Notifications** setting](pim-how-to-change-default-settings.md#notifications) is set to **Enable**.

The following shows an example email that is sent when a user activates an Azure AD role for the fictional Contoso organization.

### Weekly Privileged Identity Management digest email for Azure AD roles

A weekly Privileged Identity Management summary email for Azure AD roles is sent to Privileged Role Administrators, Security Administrators, and Global Administrators that have enabled Privileged Identity Management. This weekly email provides a snapshot of Privileged Identity Management activities for the week as well as privileged role assignments. It is only available for tenants on the public cloud. Here's an example email:

![Weekly Privileged Identity Management digest email for Azure AD roles](./media/pim-email-notifications/email-directory-weekly.png)

The email includes four tiles:

| Tile | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Users activated** | Number of times users activated their eligible role inside the tenant. |
| **Users made permanent** | Number of times users with an eligible assignment is made permanent. |
| **Role assignments in Privileged Identity Management** | Number of times users are assigned an eligible role inside Privileged Identity Management. |
| **Role assignments outside of PIM** | Number of times users are assigned a permanent role outside of Privileged Identity Management (inside Azure AD). |

The **Overview of your top roles** section lists the top five roles in your tenant based on total number of permanent and eligible administrators for each role. The **Take action** link opens the [PIM wizard](pim-security-wizard.md) where you can convert permanent administrators to eligible administrators in batches.

## PIM emails for Azure resource roles

Privileged Identity Management sends emails to Owners and User Access Administrators when the following events occur for Azure resource roles:

- When a role assignment is pending approval
- When a role is assigned
- When a role is soon to expire
- When a role is eligible to extend
- When a role is being renewed by an end user
- When a role activation request is completed

Privileged Identity Management sends emails to end users when the following events occur for Azure resource roles:

- When a role is assigned to the user
- When a user's role is expired
- When a user's role is extended
- When a user's role activation request is completed

The following shows an example email that is sent when a user is assigned an Azure resource role for the fictional Contoso organization.
