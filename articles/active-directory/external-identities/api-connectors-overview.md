# Use API connectors to customize and extend self-service sign-up 

## Overview 
As a developer or IT administrator, you can use API connectors to integrate your [self-service sign-up user flows](self-service-sign-up-overview.md) with external systems by leveraging web APIs. For example, you can use API connectors to:

- [**Integrate with a custom approval workflow**](self-service-sign-up-add-approvals.md). Connect to a custom approval system for managing account creation.
- [**Perform identity verification**](code-samples-self-service-sign-up.md#identity-verification). Use an identity verification service to add an extra level of security to account creation decisions.
- **Validate user input data**. Validate against malformed or invalid user data. For example, you can validate user-provided data against existing data in an external data store or list of permitted values. If invalid, you can ask a user to provide valid data or block the user from continuing the sign-up flow.
- **Overwrite user attributes**. Reformat or assign a value to an attribute collected from the user. For example, if a user enters the first name in all lowercase or all uppercase letters, you can format the name with only the first letter capitalized. 
<!-- - **Enrich user data**. Integrate with your external cloud systems that store user information to integrate them with the sign-up flow. For example, your API can receive the user's email address, query a CRM system, and return the user's loyalty number. Returned claims can be used to pre-fill form fields or return additional data in the application token.  -->
- **Run custom business logic**. You can trigger downstream events in your cloud systems to send push notifications, update corporate databases, manage permissions, audit databases, and perform other custom actions.

An API connector provides Azure Active Directory with the information needed to call API endpoint by defining the HTTP endpoint URL and authentication. Once you configure an API connector, you can enable it for a specific step in a user flow. When a user reaches that step in the sign up flow, the API connector is invoked and materializes as an HTTP POST request to your API, sending user information ("claims") as key-value pairs in a JSON body. The API response can affect the execution of the user flow. For example, the API response can block a user from signing up, ask the user to re-enter information, or overwrite and append user attributes.

## Where you can enable an API connector in a user flow

There are two places in a user flow where you can enable an API connector:

- After signing in with an identity provider
- Before creating the user

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In both of these cases, the API connectors are invoked during user **sign-up**, not sign-in.

### After signing in with an identity provider

An API connector at this step in the sign-up process is invoked immediately after the user authenticates with an identity provider (Google, Facebook, Azure AD). This step precedes the ***attribute collection page***, which is the form presented to the user to collect user attributes. The following are examples of API connector scenarios you might enable at this step:

- Use the email or federated identity that the user provided to look up claims in an existing system. Return these claims from the existing system, pre-fill the attribute collection page, and make them available to return in the token.
- Validate whether the user is included in an allow or deny list, and control whether they can continue with the sign-up flow.

### Before creating the user

An API connector at this step in the sign-up process is invoked after the attribute collection page, if one is included. This step is always invoked before a user account is created in Azure AD. The following are examples of scenarios you might enable at this point during sign-up:

- Validate user input data and ask a user to resubmit data.
- Block a user sign-up based on data entered by the user.
- Perform identity verification.
- Query external systems for existing data about the user to return it in the application token or store it in Azure AD.

> If an invalid response is returned or another error occurs (for example, a network error), the user will be redirected to the app with the error re -->
