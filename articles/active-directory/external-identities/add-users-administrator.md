# Add Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration users in the Azure portal

As a user who is assigned any of the limited administrator directory roles, you can use the Azure portal to invite B2B collaboration users. You can invite guest users to the directory, to a group, or to an application. After you invite a user through any of these methods, the invited user's account is added to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), with a user type of *Guest*. The guest user must then redeem their invitation to access resources. An invitation of a user does not expire.

After you add a guest user to the directory, you can either send the guest user a direct link to a shared app, or the guest user can select the redemption URL in the invitation email. For more information about the redemption process, see [B2B collaboration invitation redemption](redemption-experience.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should follow the steps in [How-to: Add your organization's privacy info in Azure Active Directory](../fundamentals/active-directory-properties-area.md) to add the URL of your organization's privacy statement. As part of the first time invitation redemption process, an invited user must consent to your privacy terms to continue. 

## Before you begin

Make sure your organization's external collaboration settings are configured such that you're allowed to invite guests. By default, all users and admins can invite guests. But your organization's external collaboration policies might be configured to prevent certain types of users or admins from inviting guests. To find out how to view and set these policies, see [Enable B2B external collaboration and manage who can invite guests](delegate-invitations.md).

## Add guest users to the directory

To add B2B collaboration users to the directory, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a user who is assigned a limited administrator directory role or the Guest Inviter role.
2. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory** from any page.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.
4. Select **New guest user**.
5. On the **New user** page, select **Invite user** and then add the guest user's information.

   ![Guest user type image](media/add-users-administrator/invite-user.png)

      - **Name.** The first and last name of the guest user.
   - **Email address (required)**. The email address of the guest user.
   - **Personal message (optional)** Include a personal welcome message to the guest user.
   - **Groups**: You can add the guest user to one or more existing groups, or you can do it later.
   -  **Roles**: If you require Azure AD administrative permissions for the user, you can add them to an Azure AD role by selecting **User** next to **Roles**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > Group email addresses aren’t supported; enter the email address for an individual. Also, some email providers allow users to add a plus symbol (+) and additional text to their email addresses to help with things like inbox filtering. However, Azure AD doesn’t currently support plus symbols in email addresses. To avoid delivery issues, omit the plus symbol and any characters following it up to the @ symbol.
6. Select **Invite** to automatically send the invitation to the guest user. 
 
After you send the invitation, the user account is automatically added to the directory as a guest.

## Add guest users to a group
If you need to manually add B2B collaboration users to a group, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an Azure AD administrator.
2. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory** from any page.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Groups**.
4. Select a group (or select **New group** to create a new one). It's a good idea to include in the group description that the group contains B2B guest users.
5. Select the link under **Members**.
6. Do one of the following:

     - If the guest user already exists in the directory, search for the B2B user. Select the user, and then select **Select** to add the user to the group.
     - If the guest user does not already exist in the directory, invite them to the group by typing their email address in the search box, typing an optional personal message, and then choosing **Invite**. The invitation automatically goes out to the invited user.

You can also use dynamic groups with Azure AD B2B collaboration. For more information, see [Dynamic groups and Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration](use-dynamic-groups.md).

## Add guest users to an application

To add B2B collaboration users to an application, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an Azure AD administrator.
2. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory** from any page.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Enterprise applications**.
4. On the **All applications** page, select the application to which you want to add guest users.
5. Under **Manage**, select **Users and groups**.
6. Select **Add user**.
7. Under **Add Assignment**, select **User and groups**.
8. Do one of the following:
   - If the guest user already exists in the directory, search for the B2B user. Select the user, choose **Select**, and then select **Assign** to add the user to the app.
   - If the guest user does not already exist in the directory, under **Select member or invite an external user**, type the user's email address. In the message box, type an optional personal message. Under the message box, select **Invite**.
               ![Screenshot that highlights where to add the user's email address, the personalized message, and also highlights the Invite button.](./media/add-users-administrator/app-invite-users.png)

10.  The guest user appears in the application's **Users and groups** list with the assigned role of **Default Access**. If the application provides different roles and you want to change the user's role, do the following:
   - Select the check box next to the guest user, and then select the **Edit** button. 
   - On the **Edit Assignment** page, choose the link under **Select a role**, and select the role you want to assign to the user.
   - Choose **Select**.
   - Select **Assign**.
 
## Resend invitations to guest users

If a guest user has not yet redeemed their invitation, you can resend the invitation email.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an Azure AD administrator.
2. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory** from any page.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.
4. Select the user account.
5. In the **Identity** section, under **Invitation accepted**, Select the **(manage)** link. 
6. If the user has not yet accepted the invitation, Select the **Yes** option to resend.
