# Configure Azure Active Directory sign in behavior for an application by using a Home Realm Discovery policy

This article provides an introduction to configuring Azure Active Directory authentication behavior for federated users using Home Realm Discovery (HRD) policy.  It covers using auto-acceleration to skip the username entry screen and automatically forward users to federated login endpoints.  Microsoft does not recommend configuring auto-acceleration any longer, as it can prevent the use of stronger authentication methods such as FIDO and hinders collaboration.

## Home Realm Discovery

Home Realm Discovery (HRD) is the process that allows Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to determine which identity provider ("IdP") a user needs to authenticate with at sign-in time.  When a user signs in to an Azure AD tenant to access a resource, or to the Azure AD common sign-in page, they type a user name (UPN). Azure AD uses that to discover where the user needs to sign in.

The user will be taken to one of the following identity providers to be authenticated:

- The home tenant of the user (might be the same tenant as the resource that the user is attempting to access).

- Microsoft account.  The user is a guest in the resource tenant that uses a consumer account for authentication.

- An on-premises identity provider such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

- Another identity provider that's federated with the Azure AD tenant.

## Auto-acceleration

Some organizations configure domains in their Azure Active Directory tenant to federate with another IdP, such as AD FS for user authentication.

When a user signs into an application, they are first presented with an Azure AD sign-in page. After they have typed their UPN, if they are in a federated domain they are then taken to the sign-in page of the IdP serving that domain. Under certain circumstances, administrators might want to direct users to the sign-in page when they're signing in to specific applications.

As a result users can skip the initial Azure Active Directory page. This process is referred to as "sign-in auto-acceleration."

In cases where the tenant is federated to another IdP for sign-in, auto-acceleration makes user sign-in more streamlined.  You can configure auto-acceleration for individual applications.

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure an application for auto-acceleration, users can't use managed credentials (like FIDO) and guest users can't sign in. If you take a user straight to a federated IdP for authentication, there is no way to for them to get back to the Azure Active Directory sign-in page. Guest users, who might need to be directed to other tenants or an external IdP such as a Microsoft account, can't sign in to that application because they're skipping the Home Realm Discovery step.

There are three ways to control auto-acceleration to a federated IdP:

- Use a [domain hint](#domain-hints) on authentication requests for an application.
- Configure a Home Realm Discovery policy to [force auto-acceleration](#home-realm-discovery-policy-for-auto-acceleration).
- Configure a Home Realm Discovery policy to [ignore domain hints](prevent-domain-hints-with-home-realm-discovery.md) from specific applications or for certain domains.

### Domain hints

Domain hints are directives that are included in the authentication request from an application. They can be used to accelerate the user to their federated IdP sign-in page. Or they can be used by a multi-tenant application to accelerate the user straight to the branded Azure AD sign-in page for their tenant.

For example, the application "largeapp.com" might enable their customers to access the application at a custom URL "contoso.largeapp.com." The app might also include a domain hint to contoso.com in the authentication request.

Domain hint syntax varies depending on the protocol that's used, and it's typically configured in the application.

**WS-Federation**:  whr=contoso.com in the query string.

**SAML**:  Either a SAML authentication request that contains a domain hint or a query string whr=contoso.com.

**Open ID Connect**: A query string domain_hint=contoso.com.

By default, Azure AD attempts to redirect sign-in to the IdP that's configured for a domain if **both** of the following are true:

- A domain hint is included in the authentication request from the application **and**
- The tenant is federated with that domain.

If the domain hint doesn't refer to a verified federated domain, it is ignored.

For more information about auto-acceleration using the domain hints that are supported by Azure Active Directory, see the [Enterprise Mobility + Security blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/02/11/using-azure-ad-to-land-users-on-their-custom-login-page-from-within-your-app/).

> [!NOTE]
> If a domain hint is included in an authentication request and [should be respected](#home-realm-discovery-policy-to-prevent-auto-acceleration), its presence overrides auto-acceleration that is set for the application in HRD policy.

### Home Realm Discovery policy for auto-acceleration

Some applications do not provide a way to configure the authentication request they emit. In these cases, it's not possible to use domain hints to control auto-acceleration. Auto-acceleration can be configured via Home Realm Discovery policy to achieve the same behavior.

### Home Realm Discovery policy to prevent auto-acceleration

Some Microsoft and SaaS applications automatically include domain_hints (for example, `https://outlook.com/contoso.com` results in a login request with `&domain_hint=contoso.com` appended), which can disrupt rollout of managed credentials like FIDO.  You can use [Home Realm Discovery Policy](/graph/api/resources/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicy) to ignore domain hints from certain apps or for certain domains, during rollout of managed credentials.

## Enable direct ROPC authentication of federated users for legacy applications

Best practice is for applications to use AAD libraries and interactive sign-in to authenticate users. The libraries take care of the federated user flows.  Sometimes legacy applications, especially those that use ROPC grants, submit username and password directly to Azure AD, and aren't written to understand federation. They don't perform home realm discovery and do not interact with the correct federated endpoint to authenticate a user. If you choose to, you can use HRD Policy to enable specific legacy applications that submit username/password credentials using the ROPC grant to authenticate directly with Azure Active Directory. Password Hash Sync must be enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only enable direct authentication if you have Password Hash Sync turned on and you know it's okay to authenticate this application without any policies implemented by your on-premises IdP. If you turn off Password Hash Sync, or turn off Directory Synchronization with AD Connect for any reason, you should remove this policy to prevent the possibility of direct authentication using a stale password hash.

## Set HRD policy

There are three steps to setting HRD policy on an application for federated sign-in auto-acceleration or direct cloud-based applications:

1. Create an HRD policy.

2. Locate the service principal to which to attach the policy.

3. Attach the policy to the service principal.

Policies only take effect for a specific application when they are attached to a service principal.

Only one HRD policy can be active on a service principal at any one time.

You can use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage HRD policy.

Following is an example HRD policy definition:

```json
{  
  "HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy":
  {  
    "AccelerateToFederatedDomain":true,
    "PreferredDomain":"federated.example.edu",
    "AllowCloudPasswordValidation":false,    
  }
}
```

The policy type is "[HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy](/graph/api/resources/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicy)".

**AccelerateToFederatedDomain** is optional. If **AccelerateToFederatedDomain** is false, the policy has no effect on auto-acceleration. If **AccelerateToFederatedDomain** is true and there is only one verified and federated domain in the tenant, then users will be taken straight to the federated IdP for sign in. If it is true and there is more than one verified domain in the tenant, **PreferredDomain** must be specified.

**PreferredDomain** is optional. **PreferredDomain** should indicate a domain to which to accelerate. It can be omitted if the tenant has only one federated domain.  If it is omitted, and there is more than one verified federated domain, the policy has no effect.

 If **PreferredDomain** is specified, it must match a verified, federated domain for the tenant. All users of the application must be able to sign in to that domain - users who cannot sign in at the federated domain will be trapped and unable to complete sign in.

**AllowCloudPasswordValidation** is optional. If **AllowCloudPasswordValidation** is true then the application is allowed to authenticate a federated user by presenting username/password credentials directly to the Azure Active Directory token endpoint. This only works if Password Hash Sync is enabled.

Additionally, two tenant-level HRD options exist, not shown above:

- **AlternateIdLogin** is optional.  If enabled, this [allows users to sign in with their email addresses instead of their UPN](../authentication/howto-authentication-use-email-signin.md) at the Azure AD sign in page.  Alternate IDs rely on the user not being auto-accelerated to a federated IDP.

- **DomainHintPolicy** is an optional complex object that [*prevents* domain hints from auto-accelerating users to federated domains](prevent-domain-hints-with-home-realm-discovery.md). This tenant-wide setting is used to ensure that applications which send domain hints do not prevent users from signing in with cloud-managed credentials.

### Priority and evaluation of HRD policies

HRD policies can be created and then assigned to specific organizations and service principals. This means that it is possible for multiple policies to apply to a specific application, so Azure AD must decide which one takes precedence. A set of rules decides which HRD policy (of many applied) takes effect:

- If a domain hint is present in the authentication request, then HRD policy for the tenant (the policy set as the tenant default) is checked to see if [domain hints should be ignored](prevent-domain-hints-with-home-realm-discovery.md). If domain hints are allowed, the behavior that's specified by the domain hint is used.

- Otherwise, if a policy is explicitly assigned to the service principal, it is enforced.

- If there is no domain hint, and no policy is explicitly assigned to the service principal, a policy that's explicitly assigned to the parent organization of the service principal is enforced.

- If there is no domain hint, and no policy has been assigned to the service principal or the organization, the default HRD behavior is used.

## Tutorial for setting HRD policy on an application

We'll use Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets to walk through a few scenarios, including:

- Setting up HRD policy to do auto-acceleration for an application in a tenant with a single federated domain.

- Setting up HRD policy to do auto-acceleration  for an application to one of several domains that are verified for your tenant.

- Setting up HRD policy to enable a legacy application to do direct username/password authentication to Azure Active Directory for a federated user.

- Listing the applications for which a policy is configured.

### Prerequisites

In the following examples, you create, update, link, and delete policies on application service principals in Azure AD.

1. To begin, download the latest Azure AD PowerShell cmdlet preview.

2. After you have downloaded the Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets, run the Connect command to sign in to Azure AD with your admin account:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzureAD -Confirm
    ```

3. Run the following command to see all the policies in your organization:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureADPolicy
    ```

If nothing is returned, it means you have no policies created in your tenant.

### Example: Set an HRD policy for an application

In this example, you create a policy that when it is assigned to an application either:

- Auto-accelerates users to an AD FS sign-in screen when they are signing in to an application when there is a single domain in your tenant.
- Auto-accelerates users to an AD FS sign-in screen there is more than one federated domain in your tenant.
- Enables non-interactive username/password sign in directly to Azure Active Directory for federated users for the applications the policy is assigned to.

#### Step 1: Create an HRD policy

The following policy auto-accelerates users to an AD FS sign-in screen when they are signing in to an application when there is a single domain in your tenant.

```powershell
New-AzureADPolicy -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"AccelerateToFederatedDomain`":true}}") -DisplayName BasicAutoAccelerationPolicy -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```

The following policy auto-accelerates users to an AD FS sign-in screen there is more than one federated domain in your tenant. If you have more than one federated domain that authenticates users for applications, you need specify the domain to auto-accelerate.

```powershell
New-AzureADPolicy -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"AccelerateToFederatedDomain`":true, `"PreferredDomain`":`"federated.example.edu`"}}") -DisplayName MultiDomainAutoAccelerationPolicy -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```

To create a policy to enable username/password authentication for federated users directly with Azure Active Directory for specific applications, run the following command:

```powershell
New-AzureADPolicy -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"AllowCloudPasswordValidation`":true}}") -DisplayName EnableDirectAuthPolicy -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```

To see your new policy and get its **ObjectID**, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-AzureADPolicy
```

To apply the HRD policy after you have created it, you can assign it to multiple application service principals.

#### Step 2: Locate the service principal to which to assign the policy

You need the **ObjectID** of the service principals to which you want to assign the policy. There are several ways to find the **ObjectID** of service principals.

You can use the portal, or you can query [Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal). You can also go to the [Graph Explorer Tool](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) and sign in to your Azure AD account to see all your organization's service principals.

Because you are using PowerShell, you can use the following cmdlet to list the service principals and their IDs.

```powershell
Get-AzureADServicePrincipal
```

#### Step 3: Assign the policy to your service principal

After you have the **ObjectID** of the service principal of the application for which you want to configure auto-acceleration, run the following command. This command associates the HRD policy that you created in step 1 with the service principal that you located in step 2.

```powershell
Add-AzureADServicePrincipalPolicy -Id <ObjectID of the Service Principal> -RefObjectId <ObjectId of the Policy>
```

You can repeat this command for each service principal to which you want to add the policy.

In the case where an application already has a HomeRealmDiscovery policy assigned, you won't be able to add a second one.  In that case, change the definition of the Home Realm Discovery policy that is assigned to the application to add additional parameters.

#### Step 4: Check which application service principals your HRD policy is assigned to

To check which applications have HRD policy configured, use the **Get-AzureADPolicyAppliedObject** cmdlet. Pass it the **ObjectID** of the policy that you want to check on.

```powershell
Get-AzureADPolicyAppliedObject -id <ObjectId of the Policy>
```

#### Step 5: You're done!

Try the application to check that the new policy is working.

### Example: List the applications for which HRD policy is configured

#### Step 1: List all policies that were created in your organization

```powershell
Get-AzureADPolicy
```

Note the **ObjectID** of the policy that you want to list assignments for.

#### Step 2: List the service principals to which the policy is assigned

```powershell
Get-AzureADPolicyAppliedObject -id <ObjectId of the Policy>
```

### Example: Remove an HRD policy from an application

#### Step 1: Get the ObjectID

Use the previous example to get the **ObjectID** of the policy, and that of the application service principal from which you want to remove it.

#### Step 2: Remove the policy assignment from the application service principal

```powershell
Remove-AzureADServicePrincipalPolicy -id <ObjectId of the Service Principal>  -PolicyId <ObjectId of the policy>
```

#### Step 3: Check removal by listing the service principals to which the policy is assigned

```powershell
Get-AzureADPolicyAppliedObject -id <ObjectId of the Policy>
```
