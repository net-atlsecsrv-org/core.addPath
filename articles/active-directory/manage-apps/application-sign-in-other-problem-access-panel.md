# Problems signing in to an application from the access panel

The Access Panel is a web-based portal which enables a user with a work or school account in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to view and start cloud-based applications that the Azure AD administrator has granted them access to. 

These applications are configured on behalf of the user in the Azure AD portal. The application must be configured properly and assigned to the user or a group the user is a member of to see the application in the Access Panel.

The type of apps a user may be seeing fall in the following categories:

-   Office 365 Applications

-   Microsoft and third-party applications configured with federation-based SSO

-   Password-based SSO applications

-   Applications with existing SSO solutions

## General issues to check first

-   Make sure your using a **browser** that meets the minimum requirements for the Access Panel.

-   Make sure the user’s browser has added the URL of the application to its **trusted sites**.

-   Make sure to check the application is **configured** correctly.

-   Make sure the user’s account is **enabled** for sign-ins.

-   Make sure the user’s account is **not locked out.**

-   Make sure the user’s **password is not expired or forgotten.**

-   Make sure **Multi-Factor Authentication** is not blocking user access.

-   Make sure a **Conditional Access policy** or **Identity Protection** policy is not blocking user access.

-   Make sure that a user’s **authentication contact info** is up to date to allow Multi-Factor Authentication or Conditional Access policies to be enforced.

-   Make sure to also try clearing your browser’s cookies and trying to sign in again.

## Meeting browser requirements for the Access Panel

The Access Panel requires a browser that supports JavaScript and has CSS enabled. To use password-based single sign-on (SSO) in the Access Panel, the Access Panel extension must be installed in the user’s browser. This extension is downloaded automatically when a user selects an application that is configured for password-based SSO.

For password-based SSO, the end user’s browsers can be:

-   Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, 11 -- on Windows 7 or later

-   Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition or later

-   Chrome -- on Windows 7 or later, and on MacOS X or later

-   Firefox 26.0 or later -- on Windows XP SP2 or later, and on Mac OS X 10.6 or later

## How to install the Access Panel Browser extension

To install the Access Panel Browser extension, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the [Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com) in one of the supported browsers and sign in as a **user** in your Azure AD.

2.  Click a **password-SSO application** in the Access Panel.

3.  In the prompt asking to install the software, select **Install Now**.

4.  Based on your browser you are directed to the download link. **Add** the extension to your browser.

5.  If your browser asks, select to either **Enable** or **Allow** the extension.

6.  Once installed, **restart** your browser session.

7.  Sign in into the Access Panel and see if you can **launch** your password-SSO applications

You may also download the extension for Chrome and Microsoft Edge from the direct links below:

-   [Chrome Access Panel Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/access-panel-extension/ggjhpefgjjfobnfoldnjipclpcfbgbhl)
