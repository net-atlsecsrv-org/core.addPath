# Export apps with secrets and certificates expiring beyond the required date

This PowerShell script example exports all app registrations secrets and certificates expiring beyond a required period for the specified apps from your directory in a CSV file non-interactively.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurepowershell[main](~/powershell_scripts/application-management/export-apps-with-secrets-beyond-required.ps1 "Exports all apps with secrets and certificates expiring beyond the required date for the specified apps in your directory.")]

## Script explanation

This script is working non-interactively. The admin using it will need to change the values in the "#PARAMETERS TO CHANGE" section with their own App ID, Application Secret, Tenant Name, the period for the apps credentials expiration and the Path where the CSV will be exported.
This script uses the [Client_Credential Oauth Flow](../../develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) 
The function "RefreshToken" will build the access token based on the values of the parameters modified by the admin.

The "Add-Member" command is responsible for creating the columns in the CSV file.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
