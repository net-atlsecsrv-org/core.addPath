# Export apps with expiring secrets and certificates

This PowerShell script example exports all app registrations with expiring secrets, certificates and their owners for the specified apps from your directory in a CSV file.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

This sample requires the [AzureAD V2 PowerShell for Graph module](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2) (AzureAD) or the [AzureAD V2 PowerShell for Graph module preview version](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0-preview&preserve-view=true) (AzureADPreview).

## Sample script

[!code-azurepowershell[main](~/powershell_scripts/application-management/export-apps-with-expiring-secrets.ps1 "Exports all apps with expiring secrets and certificates for the specified apps in your directory.")]

## Script explanation

The script can be used directly without any modifications. The admin will be asked about the expiration date and whether they would like to see already expired secrets or certificates or not.

The "Add-Member" command is responsible for creating the columns in the CSV file.
The "New-Object" command creates an object to be used for the columns in the CSV file export.
You can modify the "$Path" variable directly in PowerShell, with a CSV file path, in case you'd prefer the export to be non-interactive.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [Get-AzureADApplication](/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureadapplication?view=azureadps-2.0&preserve-view=true) | Retrieves an application from your directory. |
| [Get-AzureADApplicationOwner](/powershell/module/azuread/Get-AzureADApplicationOwner?view=azureadps-2.0&preserve-view=true) | Retrieves the owners of an application from your directory. |
