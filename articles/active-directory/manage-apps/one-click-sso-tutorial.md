# One-click app configuration of single sign-on

 In this tutorial, you learn how to perform one-click, single sign-on (SSO) configuration for SAML-supporting, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) applications from the Azure Marketplace.

## Introduction to one-click SSO

The one-click SSO feature is designed to configure single sign-on for Azure Marketplace apps that support SAML protocol. On the Azure AD SSO configuration page, this option allows you to automatically configure the Azure AD metadata on the application side. In this way, you can quickly set up SSO with minimal manual effort.

## Advantages of one-click SSO

- Quick SSO configuration of Azure Marketplace applications that require manual setup on application side.
- More efficient and accurate SSO configuration.
- No partner communication or support needed for  setup. The application provides the UI for SAML configuration.

## Prerequisites

- An active subscription of the application to configure with SSO. You also need admin credentials.
- The **My Apps Secure Sign-in extension** from Microsoft installed in the browser. For more information, see [Access and use apps on the My Apps portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access).

## One-click SSO configuration steps

1. Add the application from the Azure Marketplace.

2. Select **Single sign-on**.

3. Select **Enable single sign-on**.

4. Populate the mandatory configuration values in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the application has custom claims that you need to configure, handle them before performing one-click SSO.

5. If the one-click SSO feature is available for your Azure Marketplace application, you see following screen. You might have to install the **My Apps Secure Sign-in browser extension** by selecting **Install the extension**.

6. After you add the extension to the browser, select **Setup \<Application Name\>**. After you're redirected to the application admin portal, sign in as an administrator.
