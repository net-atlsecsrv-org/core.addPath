# Add a gallery app to your Azure AD organization

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) has a gallery that contains thousands of pre-integrated applications that are enabled with Enterprise single sign-on. This article describes the general steps for adding an app from the gallery to your Azure AD organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First, check for your app in the [List of tutorials on how to integrate SaaS apps with Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-tutorial-list/). You'll likely find step-by-step guidance for adding and configuring the gallery app you want to add.

## Add a gallery application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a global admin for your Azure AD tenant, a cloud application admin, or an application admin.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. In the **Azure Active Directory** pane, select **Enterprise applications**.

 4. Switch to the new gallery preview experience: In the banner at the top of the **Add an application page**, select the link that says **Click here to try out the new and improved app gallery**.

5. The **Browse Azure AD Gallery** pane opens and displays tiles for cloud platforms, on-premises applications, and featured applications. Note that the applications listed in the **Featured applications** section have icons indicating whether they support federated single sign-on (SSO) and provisioning.

6. Browse the gallery for the application you want to add, or search for the application by entering its name in the search box. Then select the application from the results. (Optional) In the form, you can edit the application name to match the needs of your organization.

1. Set the following options to determine how users who are assigned or unassigned to the application can sign into the application and if a user can see the application in the access panel.

    - **Enabled for users to sign-in** determines whether users assigned to the application can sign in.
    - **User assignment required** determines whether users who aren't assigned to the application can sign in.
    - **Visible to user** determines whether users assigned to an app can see it in the access panel and O365 launcher.

      Behavior for **assigned** users:

       | Application property settings | | | Assigned-user experience | |
       |---|---|---|---|---|
       | Enabled for users to sign-in? | User assignment required? | Visible to users? | Can assigned users sign in? | Can assigned users see the application?* |
       | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes  |
       | yes | yes | no  | yes | no   |
       | yes | no  | yes | yes | yes  |
       | yes | no  | no  | yes | no   |
       | no  | yes | yes | no  | no   |
       | no  | yes | no  | no  | no   |
       | no  | no  | yes | no  | no   |
       | no  | no  | no  | no  | no   |

      Behavior for **unassigned** users:

       | Application property settings | | | Unassigned-user experience | |
       |---|---|---|---|---|
       | Enabled for users to sign in? | User assignment required? | Visible to users? | Can unassigned users sign in? | Can unassigned users see the application?* |
       | yes | yes | yes | no  | no   |
       | yes | yes | no  | no  | no   |
       | yes | no  | yes | yes | no   |
       | yes | no  | no  | yes | no   |
       | no  | yes | yes | no  | no   |
       | no  | yes | no  | no  | no   |
       | no  | no  | yes | no  | no   |
       | no  | no  | no  | no  | no   |

     *Can the user see the application in the access panel and the Office 365 app launcher?

1. To use a custom logo, create a logo that is 215 by 215 pixels, and save it in PNG format. Then browse to your logo and upload it.
