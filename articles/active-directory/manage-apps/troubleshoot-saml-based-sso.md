# Troubleshoot SAML-based single sign-on in Azure Active Directory
If you encounter a problem when configuring an application. Verify you have followed all the steps in the tutorial for the application. In the application’s configuration, you have inline documentation on how to configure the application. Also, you can access the [List of tutorials on how to integrate SaaS apps with Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-tutorial-list/) for a detail step-by-step guidance.

## Can’t add another instance of the application
To add a second instance of an application, you need to be able to:
-   Configure a unique identifier for the second instance. You won’t be able to configure the same identifier used for the first instance.
-   Configure a different certificate than the one used for the first instance.

If the application doesn’t support any of the above. Then, you won’t be able to configure a second instance.

## Can’t add the Identifier or the Reply URL
If you’re not able to configure the Identifier or the Reply URL, confirm the Identifier and Reply URL values match the patterns pre-configured for the application.

To know the patterns pre-configured for the application:
1. Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.** Go to step 7. If you are already in the application configuration blade on Azure AD.
2. Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.
3. Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.
4. click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.
5. click **All Applications** to view a list of all your applications.
   * If you do not see the application you want show up here, use the **Filter** control at the top of the **All Applications List** and set the **Show** option to **All Applications.**
6. Select the application you want to configure single sign-on.
7. Once the application loads, click the **Single sign-on** from the application’s left-hand navigation menu.
8. Select **SAML-based Sign-on** from the **Mode** dropdown.
9. Go to the **Identifier** or **Reply URL** textbox, under the **Domain and URLs section.**
10. There are three ways to know the supported patterns for the application:
    * In the textbox, you see the supported pattern(s) as a placeholder *Example:* <https://contoso.com>.
    * if the pattern is not supported, you see a red exclamation mark when you try to enter the value in the textbox. If you hover your mouse over the red exclamation mark, you see the supported patterns.
    * In the tutorial for the application, you can also get information about the supported patterns. Under the **Configure Azure AD single sign-on** section. Go to the step for configured the values under the **Domain and URLs** section.

If the values don’t match with the patterns pre-configured on Azure AD. You can:
-   Work with the application vendor to get values that match the pattern pre-configured on Azure AD
-   Or, you can contact Azure AD team at <aadapprequest@microsoft.com> or leave a comment in the tutorial to request the update of the supported patterns for the application

## Where do I set the EntityID (User Identifier) format
You won’t be able to select the EntityID (User Identifier) format that Azure AD sends to the application in the response after user authentication.

Azure AD select the format for the NameID attribute (User Identifier) based on the value selected or the format requested by the application in the SAML AuthRequest. For more information visit the article [Single Sign-On SAML protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-single-sign-on-protocol-reference#authnrequest) under the section NameIDPolicy,

## Can’t find the Azure AD metadata to complete the configuration with the application
To download the application metadata or certificate from Azure AD, follow these steps:
1. Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.**
2. Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.
3. Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.
4. click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.
5. click **All Applications** to view a list of all your applications.
   * If you do not see the application you want show up here, use the **Filter** control at the top of the **All Applications List** and set the **Show** option to **All Applications.**
6. Select the application you have configured single sign-on.
7. Once the application loads, click the **Single sign-on** from the application’s left-hand navigation menu.
8. Go to **SAML Signing Certificate** section, then click **Download** column value. Depending on what the application requires configuring single sign-on, you see either the option to download the Metadata XML or the Certificate.

Azure AD doesn’t provide a URL to get the metadata. The metadata can only be retrieved as a XML file.
