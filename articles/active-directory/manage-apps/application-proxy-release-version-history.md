# Azure AD Application Proxy: Version release history
This article lists the versions and features of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy that have been released. The Azure AD team regularly updates Application Proxy with new features and functionality. Application Proxy connectors are updated automatically when a new version is released. 

We recommend making sure that auto-updates are enabled for your connectors to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes. Microsoft provides direct support for the lastest connector version and one version before.

### New features and improvements

- Simplified onboarding and management with fewer required ports. Application Proxy now requires opening only two standard outbound ports: 443 and 80. Application Proxy continues to use only outbound connections, so you still don't need any components in a DMZ. For details, see ourâ€¯[configuration documentation](application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).  
- If supported by your external proxy or firewall, you can now open your network by DNS instead of IP range. Application Proxy services require connections to *.msappproxy.net and *.servicebus.windows.net only.


## Earlier versions

If you're using an Application Proxy connector version earlier than 1.5.36.0, update to the latest version to ensure you have the latest fully supported features.
