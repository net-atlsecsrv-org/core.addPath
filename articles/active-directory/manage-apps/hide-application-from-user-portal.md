# Hide applications from end-users in Azure Active Directory

```PowerShell
Connect-AzureAD

$objectId = "<objectId>"
$servicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId $objectId
$tags = $servicePrincipal.tags
$tags += "HideApp"
Set-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId $objectId -Tags $tags
```
