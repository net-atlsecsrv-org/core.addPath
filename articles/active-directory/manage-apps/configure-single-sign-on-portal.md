# How to configure SAML-based single sign-on

After you've added an app to your Azure AD Enterprise Applications, you configure single sign-on settings. This article describes how to configure SAML-based single sign-on for a non-gallery app. 

> [!NOTE]
> Adding a gallery app? Find step-by-step setup instructions in the [list of SaaS app tutorials](../saas-apps/tutorial-list.md)

To configure single sign-on for a non-gallery application *without writing code*, you need to have a subscription or Azure AD Premium and the application must support SAML 2.0. For more information about Azure AD versions, visit [Azure AD pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).

## Before you begin

- If the application hasn't been added to your Azure AD tenant, see [Add a gallery app](add-gallery-app.md) or [Add a non-gallery app](add-non-gallery-app.md).
- Contact your application vendor to get the correct information for the following settings:

    | Basic SAML Configuration setting | SP-Initiated | idP-Initiated | Description |
    |:--|:--|:--|:--|
    | Identifier (Entity ID) | Required for some apps | Required for some apps | Uniquely identifies the application for which single sign-on is being configured. Azure AD sends the identifier to the application as the Audience parameter of the SAML token. The application is expected to validate it. This value also appears as the Entity ID in any SAML metadata provided by the application. *You can find this value as the **Issuer** element in the **AuthnRequest** (SAML request) sent by the application.* |
    | Reply URL | Optional | Required | Specifies where the application expects to receive the SAML token. The reply URL is also referred to as the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL. |
    | Sign-on URL | Required | Don't specify | When a user opens this URL, the service provider redirects to Azure AD to authenticate and sign on the user. Azure AD uses the URL to start the application from Office 365 or the Azure AD Access Panel. When blank, Azure AD relies on the identity provider to start single sign-on when a user launches the application.|
    | Relay State | Optional | Optional | Specifies to the application where to redirect the user after authentication is completed. Typically the value is a valid URL for the application. However, some applications use this field differently. For more information, ask the application vendor.
    | Logout URL | Optional | Optional | Used to send the SAML Logout responses back to the application.

## Step 1. Edit the Basic SAML Configuration

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a cloud application admin, or an application admin for your Azure AD tenant.

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** and select the application from the list. 
   
   - To search for the application, in the **Application Type** menu, select **All applications**, and then select **Apply**. Enter the name of the application in the search box, and then select the application from the results.

1. Under the **Manage** section, select **Single sign-on**. 

1. Select **SAML**. The **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML - Preview** page appears.

1. To edit the basic SAML configuration options, select the **Edit** icon (a pencil) in the upper-right corner of the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

     ![Configure certificates](media/configure-single-sign-on-portal/basic-saml-configuration-edit-icon.png)

1. In the appropriate fields, enter the information described in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.

1. At the top of the page, select **Save**.

## Step 2. Configure User attributes and claims 

An application might require specific user attributes or claims in the SAML token it receives from Azure AD when a user signs in. For example, specific claim URIs or claim values could be required, or **Name** might need to be something other than the username stored in Microsoft identity platform. Requirements for gallery apps are described in the [application-specific tutorials](../saas-apps/tutorial-list.md), or you can ask the application vendor. The general steps for configuring user attributes and claims are described below.

1. In the **User Attributes and Claims** section, select the **Edit** icon (a pencil) in the upper-right corner.

1. Verify the **Name Identifier Value**. The default value is *user.principalname*. The user identifier uniquely identifies each user within the application. For example, if the email address is both the username and the unique identifier, set the value to *user.mail*.

1. To modify the **Name Identifier Value**, select the **Edit** icon (a pencil) for the **Name Identifier Value** field. Make the appropriate changes to the identifier format and source, as needed. For details, see [Editing NameId](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory//develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization#editing-nameid). Save the changes when you're done. 
 
1. To configure group claims, select the **Edit** icon for the **Groups returned in claim** field. For details, see [Configure group claims](../hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md).

3. To add a claim, select **Add new claim** at the top of the page. Enter the **Name** and select the appropriate source. If you select the **Attribute** source, you'll need to choose the **Source attribute** you want to use. If you select the **Translation** source, you'll need to choose the **Transformation** and **Parameter 1** you want to use. For details, see [Adding application-specific claims](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory//develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization#adding-application-specific-claims). Save the changes when you're done. 

4. Select **Save**. The new claim appears in the table.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For additional ways to customize the SAML token from Azure AD to your application, see the following resources.
   >- To create custom roles via the Azure portal, see [Configure role claims](../develop/active-directory-enterprise-app-role-management.md).
   >- To customize the claims via PowerShell, see [Customize claims - PowerShell](../develop/active-directory-claims-mapping.md).
   >- To modify the application manifest to configure optional claims for your application, see [Configure optional claims](../develop/active-directory-optional-claims.md).
   >- To set token lifetime policies for refresh tokens, access tokens, session tokens, and ID tokens, see [Configure token lifetimes](../develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes.md). Or, to restrict authentication sessions via Azure AD Conditional Access, see [authentication session management capabilities](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083106).

## Step 3. Manage the SAML signing certificate

Azure AD uses a certificate to sign the SAML tokens it sends to the application. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, you can view or download the active certificate. You can also update, create, or import a certificate. For gallery applications, details about the certificate format are available in the applicationâ€™s SAML documentation (see the [application-specific tutorials](../saas-apps/tutorial-list.md)). 

1. Go to the **SAML Signing Certificate** section. Depending on the type of application, you'll see options to download the certificate in Base64 format, Raw format, or Federation Metadata XML. Azure AD also provides the **App Federation Metadata Url** where you can access the metadata specific to the application in the format `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory ID>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml?appid=<Application ID>`.

1. To manage, create, or import a certificate, select the **Edit** icon (a pencil) in the upper-right corner of the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, and then do any of the following:

   - To create a new certificate, select **New Certificate**, select the **Expiration Date**, and then select **Save**. To activate the certificate, select the context menu (**...**) and select **Make certificate active**.
   - To upload a certificate with private key and pfx credentials, select **Import Certificate** and browse to the certificate. Enter the **PFX Password**, and then select **Add**.  
   - To configure advanced certificate signing options, use the following options. For descriptions of these options, see the [Advanced certificate signing options](certificate-signing-options.md) article.
      - In the **Signing Option** drop-down list, choose **Sign SAML response**, **Sign SAML assertion**, or **Sign SAML response and assertion**.
      - In the **Signing Algorithm** drop-down list, choose **SHA-1** or **SHA-256**.
   - To notify additional people when the active certificate is near its expiration date, enter the email addresses in the **Notification email addresses** fields.

1. Select **Save** at the top of the **SAML Signing Certificate** section. 

## Step 4. Set up the application to use Azure AD

The **Set up \<applicationName>** section lists the values that need to be configured in the application so it will use Azure AD as a SAML identity provider. The required values vary according to the application. For details, see the application's SAML documentation.

1. Scroll down to the **Set up \<applicationName>** section. 
2. Copy the value from each row in this section as needed and follow the application-specific instructions for adding the value to the application. For gallery apps, you can view the documentation by selecting **View step-by-step instructions**. 
   - The **Login URL** and **Logout URL** values both resolve to the same endpoint, which is the SAML request-handling endpoint for your instance of Azure AD. 
   - The **Azure AD Identifier** is the value of the **Issuer** in the SAML token issued to the application.
1. When you've pasted all the values into the appropriate fields, select **Save**.

## Step 5. Validate single sign-on

You're ready to test the settings to see if single sign-on works for you, the admin.  

1. Open the single sign-on settings for your application. 
2. Scroll to the **Validate single sign-on with <applicationName>** section. For this tutorial, this section is called **Set up GitHub-test**.
3. Select **Test**. The testing options appear.
4. Select **Sign in as current user**. 

If sign-on is successful, you're ready to assign users and groups to your SAML application.
If an error message appears, complete the following steps:

1. Copy and paste the specifics into the **What does the error look like?** box.

    ![Use the "What does the error look like" box to get resolution guidance](media/configure-single-sign-on-portal/error-guidance.png)

1. Select **Get resolution guidance**. The root cause and resolution guidance appear.  In this example, the user wasn't assigned to the application.
1. Read the resolution guidance and then, if possible, fix the issue.
1. Run the test again until it completes successfully.
