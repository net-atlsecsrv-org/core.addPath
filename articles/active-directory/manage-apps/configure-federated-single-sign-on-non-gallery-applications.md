# How to configure federated single sign-on for a non-gallery application

This article provides a high-level overview of the steps required to configure federated single sign-on with SAML 2.0 for a non-gallery (e.g., custom) application.

-   Configure the application’s metadata values in Azure AD (Sign on URL, Identifier, Reply URL)

-   [Select User Identifier and add user attributes to be sent to the application](#select-user-identifier-and-add-user-attributes-to-be-sent-to-the-application)

-   [Retrieve Azure AD metadata and certificate](#download-the-azure-ad-metadata-or-certificate)

-   Configure Azure AD metadata values in the application (Sign on URL, Issuer, Logout URL and certificate)

-   Assign users to the application

## Configuring single sign-on to non-gallery applications

To configure single sign-on for an application that is not in the Azure AD gallery, follow the steps below:

1. Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.**

2. Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.

3. Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.

4. click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.

5. click the **Add** button at the top-right corner on the **Enterprise Applications** pane.

6. click **Non-gallery application** in the **Add your own app** section

7. Enter the name of the application in the **Name** textbox.

8. Click **Add** button, to add the application.

9. Once the application loads, click the **Single sign-on** from the application’s left-hand navigation menu.

10. Select **SAML-based Sign-on** in the **Mode** dropdown.

11. Enter the required values in **Domain and URLs.** You should get these values from the application vendor.

    1. To configure the application as IdP-initiated SSO, enter the Reply URL and the Identifier.

    2. **Optional:** To configure the application as SP-initiated SSO, the Sign-on URL it’s a required value.

12. In the **User attributes**, select the unique identifier for your users in the **User Identifier** dropdown.

13. **Optional:** click **View and edit all other user attributes** to edit the attributes to be sent to the application in the SAML token when users sign in.

    To add an attribute:

    1. click **Add attribute**. Enter the **Name** and the select the **Value** from the dropdown.

    2. Click **Save.** You see the new attribute in the table.

14. click **Configure &lt;application name&gt;** to access documentation on how to configure single sign-on in the application. Also, you has Azure AD URLs and certificate required for the application.

15. [Assign users to the application.](#assign-users-to-the-application)

## Select User Identifier and add user attributes to be sent to the application

To select the User Identifier or add user attributes, follow the steps below:

1. Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.**

2. Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.

3. Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.

4. click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.

5. click **All Applications** to view a list of all your applications.

   * If you do not see the application you want show up here, use the **Filter** control at the top of the **All Applications List** and set the **Show** option to **All Applications.**

6. Select the application you have configured single sign-on.

7. Once the application loads, click the **Single sign-on** from the application’s left-hand navigation menu.

8. Under the **User attributes** section, select the unique identifier for your users in the **User Identifier** dropdown. The selected option needs to match the expected value in the application to authenticate the user.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Azure AD select the format for the NameID attribute (User Identifier) based on the value selected or the format requested by the application in the SAML AuthRequest. For more information visit the article [Single Sign-On SAML protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-single-sign-on-protocol-reference#authnrequest) under the section NameIDPolicy.

9. To add user attributes, click **View and edit all other user attributes** to edit the attributes to be sent to the application in the SAML token when users sign in.

   To add an attribute:

   1. click **Add attribute**. Enter the **Name** and the select the **Value** from the dropdown.

   2. Click **Save.** You see the new attribute in the table.

## Download the Azure AD metadata or certificate

To download the application metadata or certificate from Azure AD, follow the steps below:

1. Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin.**

2. Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.

8. Go to **SAML Signing Certificate** section, then click **Download** column value. Depending on what the application requires configuring single sign-on, you see either the option to download the Metadata XML or the Certificate.

Azure AD also provides a URL to get the metadata. Follow this pattern to get the metadata URL specific to the application: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory ID>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml?appid=<Application ID>`.

## Assign users to the application

To assign one or more users to an application directly, follow the steps below:
