# Problem signing in to the access panel website

The Access Panel is a web-based portal that enables a user who has a work or school account in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to view and launch cloud-based applications that the Azure AD administrator has granted them access to. A user who has Azure AD editions can also use self-service group and app management capabilities through the Access Panel. The Access Panel is separate from the Azure portal and does not require users to have an Azure subscription.

Users can sign in to the Access Panel if they have a work or school account in Azure AD.

-   Users can be authenticated by Azure AD directly.

-   Users can be authenticated by using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

-   Users can be authenticated by Windows Server Active Directory.

If a user has a subscription for Azure or Office 365 and has been using the Azure portal or an Office 365 application, they'll be able to use the Access Panel seamlessly without needing to sign in again. Users who are not authenticated are prompted to sign in by using the username and password for their account in Azure AD. If the organization has configured federation, typing the username is sufficient.

## General issues to check first 

-   Make sure the user is signing in to the **correct URL**: <https://myapps.microsoft.com>

-   Make sure the user’s browser has added the URL to its **trusted sites**

-   Make sure the user’s account is **enabled** for sign-ins.

-   Make sure the user’s account is **not locked out.**

-   Make sure the user’s **password is not expired or forgotten.**

-   Make sure **Multi-Factor Authentication** is not blocking user access.

-   Make sure a **Conditional Access policy** or **Identity Protection** policy is not blocking user access.

-   Make sure that a user’s **authentication contact info** is up-to-date to allow Multi-Factor Authentication or Conditional Access policies to be enforced.

-   Make sure to also try clearing your browser’s cookies and trying to sign in again.

## Meeting browser requirements for the Access Panel

The Access Panel requires a browser that supports JavaScript and has CSS enabled. To use password-based single sign-on (SSO) in the Access Panel, the Access Panel extension must be installed in the user’s browser. This extension is downloaded automatically when a user selects an application that is configured for password-based SSO.

For password-based SSO, the end user’s browsers can be:

-   Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, 11 -- on Windows 7 or later

-   Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition or later 

-   Chrome -- on Windows 7 or later, and on MacOS X or later

-   Firefox 26.0 or later -- on Windows XP SP2 or later, and on Mac OS X 10.6 or later


## Problems with the user’s account

Access to the Access Panel can be blocked due to a problem with the user’s account. Following are some ways you can troubleshoot and solve problems with users and their account settings:

-   [Check if a user account exists in Azure Active Directory](#check-if-a-user-account-exists-in-azure-active-directory)

-   [Reset a user’s password](#reset-a-users-password)

-   [Check a user’s multi-factor authentication status](#check-a-users-multi-factor-authentication-status)

-   [Check a user’s authentication contact info](#check-a-users-authentication-contact-info)

-   [Check a user’s group memberships](#check-a-users-group-memberships)

-   [Check a user’s assigned licenses](#check-a-users-assigned-licenses)
