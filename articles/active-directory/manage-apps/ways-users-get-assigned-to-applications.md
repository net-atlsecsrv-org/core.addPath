# Understand how users are assigned to apps in Azure Active Directory
This article help you to understand how users get assigned to an application in your tenant.

## How do users get assigned to an application in Azure AD?
For a user to access an application, they must first be assigned to it in some way. Assignment can be performed by an administrator, a business delegate, or sometimes, the user themselves. Below describes the ways users can get assigned to applications:

*  An administrator [assigns a user](./assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to the application directly
*  An administrator [assigns a group](./assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) that the user is a member of to the application, including:
    * A group that was synchronized from on-premises
    * A static security group created in the cloud
    * A [dynamic security group](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership.md) created in the cloud
    * A Microsoft 365 group created in the cloud
    * The [All Users](../fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md) group
*  An administrator enables [Self-service Application Access](./manage-self-service-access.md) to allow a user to add an application using [My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md) **Add App** feature **without business approval**
*  An administrator enables [Self-service Application Access](./manage-self-service-access.md) to allow a user to add an application using [My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md) **Add App** feature, but only **with prior approval from a selected set of business approvers**
*  An administrator enables [Self-service Group Management](../enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management.md) to allow a user to join a group that an application is assigned to **without business approval**
*  An administrator enables [Self-service Group Management](../enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management.md) to allow a user to join a group that an application is assigned to, but only **with prior approval from a selected set of business approvers**
*  An administrator assigns a license to a user directly for a first party application, like [Microsoft 365](https://products.office.com/)
*  An administrator assigns a license to a group that the user is a member of to a first party application, like [Microsoft 365](https://products.office.com/)
*  An [administrator consents to an application](../develop/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant.md) to be used by all users and then a user signs in to the application
* A user [consents to an application](../develop/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant.md) themselves by signing in to the application
