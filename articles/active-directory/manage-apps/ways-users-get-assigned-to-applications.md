# How to assign users to applications

This article help you to understand how users get assigned to an application in your tenant.

## How do users get assigned to an application in Azure AD?

For a user to access an application, they must first be assigned to it in some way. Assignment can be performed by an administrator, a business delegate, or sometimes, the user themselves. Below describes the ways users can get assigned to applications:

1.  An administrator [assigns a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-coreapps-assign-user-azure-portal) to the application directly

2.  An administrator [assigns a group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-coreapps-assign-user-azure-portal) that the user is a member of to the application, including:

    * A group that was synchronized from on-premises

    * A static security group created in the cloud

    * A [dynamic security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-groups-dynamic-membership-azure-portal) created in the cloud

    * An Office 365 group created in the cloud

    * The [All Users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-accessmanagement-dedicated-groups) group

3.  An administrator enables [Self-service Application Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-application-access) to allow a user to add an application using the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction) **Add App** feature **without business approval**

4.  An administrator enables [Self-service Application Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-application-access) to allow a user to add an application using the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction) **Add App** feature, but only w**ith prior approval from a selected set of business approvers**

5.  An administrator enables [Self-service Group Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-accessmanagement-self-service-group-management) to allow a user to join a group that an application is assigned to **without business approval**

6.  An administrator enables [Self-service Group Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-accessmanagement-self-service-group-management) to allow a user to join a group that an application is assigned to, but only **with prior approval from a selected set of business approvers**

7.  An administrator assigns a license to a user directly for a first party application, like [Microsoft Office 365](https://products.office.com/)

8.  An administrator assigns a license to a group that the user is a member of to a first party application, like [Microsoft Office 365](https://products.office.com/)

9.  An [administrator consents to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview) to be used by all users and then a user signs in to the application

10. A user [consents to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview) themselves by signing in to the application
