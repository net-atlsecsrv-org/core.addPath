# How to configure self-service application assignment

Before your users can self-discover applications from their access panel, you need to enable **Self-service application access** to any applications that you wish to allow users to self-discover and request access to. This functionality is available for applications that were added from the [Azure AD Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-gallery-app), [Azure AD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy) or were added via [user or admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience). 

This feature is a great way for you to save time and money as an IT group, and is highly recommended as part of a modern applications deployment with Azure Active Directory.

Using this feature, you can:

-   Let users self-discover applications from the [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/) without bothering the IT group.

-   Add those users to a pre-configured group so you can see who has requested access, remove access, and manage the roles assigned to them.

-   Optionally allow a business approver to approve application access requests so the IT group doesn’t have to.

-   Optionally configure up to 10 individuals who may approve access to this application.

-   Optionally allow a business approver to set the passwords those users can use to sign in to the application, right from the business approver’s [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/).

-   Optionally automatically assign self-service assigned users to an application role directly.

## Enable self-service application access to allow users to find their own applications

Self-service application access is a great way to allow users to self-discover applications, optionally allow the business group to approve access to those applications. You can allow the business group to manage the credentials assigned to those users for Password Single-Sign On Applications right from their access panels.

To enable self-service application access to an application, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a **Global Administrator.**

2.  Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left hand navigation menu.

3.  Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.

4.  click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left hand navigation menu.

5.  click **All Applications** to view a list of all your applications.

    * If you do not see the application you want show up here, use the **Filter** control at the top of the **All Applications List** and set the **Show** option to **All Applications.**

6.  Select the application you want to enable Self-service access to from the list.

7.  Once the application loads, click **Self-service** from the application’s left hand navigation menu.

8.  To enable Self-service application access for this application, turn the **Allow users to request access to this application?** toggle to **Yes.**

9.  Next, to select the group to which users who request access to this application should be added, click the selector next to the label **To which group should assigned users be added?** and select a group.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Groups synchronized from on-premises are not supported to be used for the group to which users who request access to this application should be added.
  
10. **Optional:** If you wish to require a business approval before users are allowed access, set the **Require approval before granting access to this application?** toggle to **Yes**.

11. **Optional: For applications using password single-sign on only,** if you wish to allow those business approvers to specify the passwords that are sent to this application for approved users, set the **Allow approvers to set user’s passwords for this application?** toggle to **Yes**.

12. **Optional:** To specify the business approvers who are allowed to approve access to this application, click the selector next to the label **Who is allowed to approve access to this application?** to select up to 10 individual business approvers.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Groups are not supported.
     >

13. **Optional:** **For applications which expose roles**, if you wish to assign self-service approved users to a role, click the selector next to the **To which role should users be assigned in this application?** to select the role to which these users should be assigned.

14. Click the **Save** button at the top of the blade to finish.

Once you complete Self-service application configuration, users can navigate to their [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/) and click the **+Add** button to find the apps to which you have enabled Self-service access. Business approvers also see a notification in their [Application Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/). You can enable an email notifying them when a user has requested access to an application that requires their approval. 

These approvals support single approval workflows only, meaning that if you specify multiple approvers, any single approver may approver access to the application.
