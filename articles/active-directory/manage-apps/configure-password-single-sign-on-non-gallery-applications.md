# How to configure password single sign-on for a non-gallery application

In addition to the choices found within the Azure AD Application Gallery, you also have the option to add a **non-gallery application** when the application you want is not listed there. Using this capability, you can add any application that already exists in your organization, or any third-party application that you might use from a vendor who is not already part of the [Azure AD Application Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

Once you add a non-gallery application, you can then configure the Single sign-on method this application uses by selecting the **Single Sign-on** navigation item on an Enterprise Application in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

One of the Single Sign-on methods available to you is the [Password-Based Single Sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis) option. With the **add a non-gallery application** experience, you can integrate any application that renders an HTML-based username and password input field, even if it is not in our set of pre-integrated applications.

The way this works is by a page scraping technology that is part of the Access Panel extension that allows us to auto-detect username and password input fields, store them securely for your specific application instance. Then securely replay usernames and passwords to those fields when a user navigates to that application on the application access panel.

This is a great way to get started integrating any kind of application into Azure AD quickly, and allows you to:

-   Integrate **any application in the world** with your Azure AD tenant, so long as it renders an HTML username and password input field

-   Enable **Single Sign-on for your users** by securely storing and replaying usernames and passwords for the application you’ve integrated with Azure AD

-   **Auto-detect input** fields for any application and allow you to manually detect those fields using the Access Panel Browser Extension, in case auto-detection does not find them

-   **Support applications that require multiple sign-in fields** for applications that require more than just username and password fields to sign in

-   **Customize the labels** of the username and password input fields your users see on the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction) when they enter their credentials

-   Allow your **users** to provide their own usernames and passwords for any existing application accounts they are typing in manually on the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction)

-   Allow a **member of the business group** to specify the usernames and passwords assigned to a user by using the [Self-Service Application Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-application-access) feature

-   Allow an **administrator** to specify the usernames and passwords assigned to a user by using the Update Credentials feature when assigning a user to an application

-   Allow an **administrator** to specify the shared username or password used by a group of people by using the Update Credentials feature when [assigning a group to an application](#assign-an-application-to-a-group-directly)

The following section describes how you can enable [Password-Based Single Sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis) to any application that you add using the **add a non-gallery application** experience.

## Overview of steps required

To configure an application from the Azure AD gallery you need to:

-   [Add a non-gallery application](#add-a-non-gallery-application)

-   [Configure the application for password single sign-on](#configure-the-application-for-password-single-sign-on)

-   Assign the application to a user or a group

    -   [Assign a user to an application directly](#assign-a-user-to-an-application-directly)

    -   [Assign an application to a group directly](#assign-an-application-to-a-group-directly)

## Add a non-gallery application

To add an application from the Azure AD Gallery, follow these steps:

1.  Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in as a **Global Administrator** or **Co-admin**

2.  Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by clicking **All services** at the top of the main left-hand navigation menu.

3.  Type in **“Azure Active Directory**” in the filter search box and select the **Azure Active Directory** item.

4.  click **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.
