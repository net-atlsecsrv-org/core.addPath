# How to configure password single sign-on for an Azure AD Gallery application

When you add an application from the [Azure AD Application Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis), you have the choice of how you want your users to sign in to that application. You can configure this choice at any time by selecting the **Single Sign-on** navigation item on an Enterprise Application in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

One of the single sign-on methods available to you is the [Password-Based Single Sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis) option. This is a great way to get started integrating applications into Azure AD quickly, and allows you to:

-   Enable **Single Sign-on for your users** by securely storing and replaying usernames and passwords for the application you’ve integrated with Azure AD

-   **Support applications that require multiple sign-in fields** for applications that require more than just username and password fields to sign in

-   **Customize the labels** of the username and password input fields your users see on the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction) when they enter their credentials

-   Allow your **users** to provide their own usernames and passwords for any existing application accounts they are typing in manually on the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction)

-   Allow a **member of the business group** to specify the usernames and passwords assigned to a user by using the [Self-Service Application Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-application-access) feature

-   Allow an **administrator** to specify the usernames and passwords assigned to a user by using the Update Credentials feature when [assigning a user to an application](#assign-a-user-to-an-application-directly)

-   Allow an **administrator** to specify the shared username or password used by a group of people by using the Update Credentials feature when [assigning a group to an application](#assign-an-application-to-a-group-directly)

The following section describes how you can enable [Password-Based Single Sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis) to an application that is already in the [Azure AD Application Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
