# Configure password single sign-on for an Azure AD gallery application

When you add an application from the [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis), you can choose how you want your users to sign in to that application. You can configure this choice at any time by selecting **Single Sign-on** on an enterprise application in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

One of the available single sign-on (SSO) options is [password-based single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis). This is a great way to start quickly integrating applications into Azure AD. It enables the following:

-   Securely stores and replays usernames and passwords for the application you’ve integrated with Azure AD

-   Gives support for applications that require multiple sign-in fields beyond just the username and password fields

-   Lets you customize the labels of the username and password fields that your users see on the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction) when they enter their credentials

-   Allows your users to provide their own usernames and passwords for any existing application accounts that they manually enter on the [Application Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction)

-   Allows a member of the business group to use the [Self-Service Application Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-application-access) feature to specify the usernames and passwords assigned to a user

-   Lets an administrator specify the usernames and passwords assigned to a user by using the Update Credentials feature when they [assign a user to an application](#assign-a-user-to-an-application-directly)

-   Lets an administrator use the Update Credentials feature to specify the shared username or password for a group of people when they [assign a group to an application](#assign-an-application-to-a-group-directly)

The following section describes how you can enable [password-based single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis) to an application that's already in the [Azure AD application gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Overview of required steps
To configure an application from the Azure AD gallery, you need to:

-   [Add an application from the Azure AD gallery](#add-an-application-from-the-azure-ad-gallery)

-   Assign the application to a user or a group:

    -   [Assign a user to an application directly](#assign-a-user-to-an-application-directly)

    -   [Assign an application to a group directly](#assign-an-application-to-a-group-directly)
