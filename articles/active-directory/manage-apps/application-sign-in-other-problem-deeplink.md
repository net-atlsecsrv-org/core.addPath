# Problems signing in to an application using a deeplink

The Access Panel is a web-based portal which enables a user with a work or school account in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to view and start cloud-based applications that the Azure AD administrator has granted them access to. 

These applications are configured on behalf of the user in the Azure AD portal. The application must be configured properly and assigned to the user or a group the user is a member of to see the application in the Access Panel.

Deep links or User access URLs are links your users may use to access their password-SSO applications directly from their browsers URL bars. By navigating to this link, users be automatically signed into the application without having to go to the Access Panel first. This is the same link that users use to access these applications from the Office 365 application launcher.

## General issues to check first

-   Make sure your using a **browser** that meets the minimum requirements for the Access Panel.

-   Make sure the user’s browser has added the URL of the application to its **trusted sites**.

-   Make sure to check the application is **configured** correctly.

-   Make sure the user’s account is **enabled** for sign-ins.

-   Make sure the user’s account is **not locked out.**

-   Make sure the user’s **password is not expired or forgotten.**

-   Make sure **Multi-Factor Authentication** is not blocking user access.

-   Make sure a **Conditional Access policy** or **Identity Protection** policy is not blocking user access.

-   Make sure that a user’s **authentication contact info** is up to date to allow Multi-Factor Authentication or Conditional Access policies to be enforced.

-   Make sure to also try clearing your browser’s cookies and trying to sign in again.
