# Dynamic membership rules for groups in Azure Active Directory

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can create complex attribute-based rules to enable dynamic memberships for groups. Dynamic group membership reduces the administrative overhead of adding and removing users. This article details the properties and syntax to create dynamic membership rules for users or devices. You can set up a rule for dynamic membership on security groups or Microsoft 365 groups.

When any attributes of a user or device change, the system evaluates all dynamic group rules in a directory to see if the change would trigger any group adds or removes. If a user or device satisfies a rule on a group, they are added as a member of that group. If they no longer satisfy the rule, they are removed. You can't manually add or remove a member of a dynamic group.

- You can create a dynamic group for devices or for users, but you can't create a rule that contains both users and devices.
- You can't create a device group based on the device owners' attributes. Device membership rules can only reference device attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license for each unique user that is a member of one or more dynamic groups. You don't have to assign licenses to users for them to be members of dynamic groups, but you must have the minimum number of licenses in the Azure AD organization to cover all such users. For example, if you had a total of 1,000 unique users in all dynamic groups in your organization, you would need at least 1,000 licenses for Azure AD Premium P1 to meet the license requirement.
> No license is required for devices that are members of a dynamic device group.

## Rule builder in the Azure portal

Azure AD provides a rule builder to create and update your important rules more quickly. The rule builder supports the construction of up to five expressions. The rule builder makes it easier to form a rule with a few simple expressions, however, it can't be used to reproduce every rule. If the rule builder doesn't support the rule you want to create, you can use the text box.

Here are some examples of advanced rules or syntax for which we recommend that you construct using the text box:

- Rule with more than five expressions
- The Direct reports rule
- Setting [operator precedence](#operator-precedence)
- [Rules with complex expressions](#rules-with-complex-expressions); for example `(user.proxyAddresses -any (_ -contains "contoso"))`

> [!NOTE]
> The rule builder might not be able to display some rules constructed in the text box. You might see a message when the rule builder is not able to display the rule. The rule builder doesn't change the supported syntax, validation, or processing of dynamic group rules in any way.

For more step-by-step instructions, see [Create or update a dynamic group](groups-create-rule.md).

### Rule syntax for a single expression

A single expression is the simplest form of a membership rule and only has the three parts mentioned above. A rule with a single expression looks similar to this: `Property Operator Value`, where the syntax for the property is the name of object.property.

The following is an example of a properly constructed membership rule with a single expression:

```
user.department -eq "Sales"
```

Parentheses are optional for a single expression. The total length of the body of your membership rule cannot exceed 2048 characters.

## Constructing the body of a membership rule

A membership rule that automatically populates a group with users or devices is a binary expression that results in a true or false outcome. The three parts of a simple rule are:

- Property
- Operator
- Value

The order of the parts within an expression are important to avoid syntax errors.

## Supported properties

There are three types of properties that can be used to construct a membership rule.

- Boolean
- String
- String collection

The following are the user properties that you can use to create a single expression.

### Properties of type boolean

| Properties | Allowed values | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accountEnabled |true false |user.accountEnabled -eq true |
| dirSyncEnabled |true false |user.dirSyncEnabled -eq true |

### Properties of type string

| Properties | Allowed values | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| city |Any string value or *null* |(user.city -eq "value") |
| country |Any string value or *null* |(user.country -eq "value") |
| companyName | Any string value or *null* | (user.companyName -eq "value") |
| department |Any string value or *null* |(user.department -eq "value") |

| employeeId |Any string value |(user.employeeId -eq "value")<br>(user.employeeId -ne *null*) |
| facsimileTelephoneNumber |Any string value or *null* |(user.facsimileTelephoneNumber -eq "value") |
| givenName |Any string value or *null* |(user.givenName -eq "value") |
| jobTitle |Any string value or *null* |(user.jobTitle -eq "value") |
| mail |Any string value or *null* (SMTP address of the user) |(user.mail -eq "value") |
| mailNickName |Any string value (mail alias of the user) |(user.mailNickName -eq "value") |
| mobile |Any string value or *null* |(user.mobile -eq "value") |
| objectId |GUID of the user object |(user.objectId -eq "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111") |
| onPremisesSecurityIdentifier | On-premises security identifier (SID) for users who were synchronized from on-premises to the cloud. |(user.onPremisesSecurityIdentifier -eq "S-1-1-11-1111111111-1111111111-1111111111-1111111") |
| passwordPolicies |None DisableStrongPassword DisablePasswordExpiration DisablePasswordExpiration, DisableStrongPassword |(user.passwordPolicies -eq "DisableStrongPassword") |
| physicalDeliveryOfficeName |Any string value or *null* |(user.physicalDeliveryOfficeName -eq "value") |
| postalCode |Any string value or *null* |(user.postalCode -eq "value") |
| preferredLanguage |ISO 639-1 code |(user.preferredLanguage -eq "en-US") |

| userPrincipalName |Any string value |(user.userPrincipalName -eq "alias@domain") |
| userType |member guest *null* |(user.userType -eq "Member") |

### Properties of type string collection

| Properties | Allowed values | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| otherMails |Any string value |(user.otherMails -contains "alias@domain") |
| proxyAddresses |SMTP: alias@domain smtp: alias@domain |(user.proxyAddresses -contains "SMTP: alias@domain") |

For the properties used for device rules, see [Rules for devices](#rules-for-devices).

## Supported expression operators

The following table lists all the supported operators and their syntax for a single expression. Operators can be used with or without the hyphen (-) prefix.

| Operator | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Not Equals |-ne |
| Equals |-eq |
| Not Starts With |-notStartsWith |
| Starts With |-startsWith |
| Not Contains |-notContains |
| Contains |-contains |
| Not Match |-notMatch |
| Match |-match |
| In | -in |
| Not In | -notIn |

### Using the -in and -notIn operators

If you want to compare the value of a user attribute against a number of different values you can use the -in or -notIn operators. Use the bracket symbols "[" and "]" to begin and end the list of values.

 In the following example, the expression evaluates to true if the value of user.department equals any of the values in the list:

```
   user.department -in ["50001","50002","50003","50005","50006","50007","50008","50016","50020","50024","50038","50039","51100"]
```


### Using the -match operator 
The **-match** operator is used for matching any regular expression. Examples:

```
user.displayName -match "Da.*"   
```
Da, Dav, David evaluate to true, aDa evaluates to false.

```
user.displayName -match ".*vid"
```
David evaluates to true, Da evaluates to false.

## Supported values

The values used in an expression can consist of several types, including:

* Strings
* Boolean – true, false
* Numbers
* Arrays – number array, string array

When specifying a value within an expression it is important to use the correct syntax to avoid errors. Some syntax tips are:

* Double quotes are optional unless the value is a string.
* String and regex operations are not case sensitive.
* When a string value contains double quotes, both quotes should be escaped using the \` character, for example, user.department -eq \`"Sales\`" is the proper syntax when "Sales" is the value.
* You can also perform Null checks, using null as a value, for example, `user.department -eq null`.

### Use of Null values

To specify a null value in a rule, you can use the *null* value. 

* Use -eq or -ne when comparing the *null* value in an expression.
* Use quotes around the word *null* only if you want it to be interpreted as a literal string value.
* The -not operator can't be used as a comparative operator for null. If you use it, you get an error whether you use null or $null.

The correct way to reference the null value is as follows:

```
   user.mail –ne null
```

## Rules with multiple expressions

A group membership rule can consist of more than one single expression connected by the -and, -or, and -not logical operators. Logical operators can also be used in combination. 

The following are examples of properly constructed membership rules with multiple expressions:

```
(user.department -eq "Sales") -or (user.department -eq "Marketing")
(user.department -eq "Sales") -and -not (user.jobTitle -contains "SDE")
```

### Operator precedence

All operators are listed below in order of precedence from highest to lowest. Operators on same line are of equal precedence:

```
-eq -ne -startsWith -notStartsWith -contains -notContains -match –notMatch -in -notIn
-not
-and
-or
-any -all
```

The following is an example of operator precedence where two expressions are being evaluated for the user:

```
   user.department –eq "Marketing" –and user.country –eq "US"
```

Parentheses are needed only when precedence does not meet your requirements. For example, if you want department to be evaluated first, the following shows how parentheses can be used to determine order:

```
   user.country –eq "US" –and (user.department –eq "Marketing" –or user.department –eq "Sales")
```

## Rules with complex expressions

A membership rule can consist of complex expressions where the properties, operators, and values take on more complex forms. Expressions are considered complex when any of the following are true:

* The property consists of a collection of values; specifically, multi-valued properties
* The expressions use the -any and -all operators
* The value of the expression can itself be one or more expressions

## Multi-value properties

Multi-value properties are collections of objects of the same type. They can be used to create membership rules using the -any and -all logical operators.

| Properties | Values | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| assignedPlans | Each object in the collection exposes the following string properties: capabilityStatus, service, servicePlanId |user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.servicePlanId -eq "efb87545-963c-4e0d-99df-69c6916d9eb0" -and assignedPlan.capabilityStatus -eq "Enabled") |
| proxyAddresses| SMTP: alias@domain smtp: alias@domain | (user.proxyAddresses -any (\_ -contains "contoso")) |

### Using the -any and -all operators

You can use -any and -all operators to apply a condition to one or all of the items in the collection, respectively.

* -any (satisfied when at least one item in the collection matches the condition)
* -all (satisfied when all items in the collection match the condition)

#### Example 1

assignedPlans is a multi-value property that lists all service plans assigned to the user. The following expression selects users who have the Exchange Online (Plan 2) service plan (as a GUID value) that is also in Enabled state:

```
user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.servicePlanId -eq "efb87545-963c-4e0d-99df-69c6916d9eb0" -and assignedPlan.capabilityStatus -eq "Enabled")
```

A rule such as this one can be used to group all users for whom an Microsoft 365 (or other Microsoft Online Service) capability is enabled. You could then apply with a set of policies to the group.

#### Example 2

The following expression selects all users who have any service plan that is associated with the Intune service (identified by service name "SCO"):

```
user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.service -eq "SCO" -and assignedPlan.capabilityStatus -eq "Enabled")
```

### Using the underscore (\_) syntax

The underscore (\_) syntax matches occurrences of a specific value in one of the multivalued string collection properties to add users or devices to a dynamic group. It is used with the -any or -all operators.

Here's an example of using the underscore (\_) in a rule to add members based on user.proxyAddress (it works the same for user.otherMails). This rule adds any user with proxy address that contains "contoso" to the group.

```
(user.proxyAddresses -any (_ -contains "contoso"))
```

## Other properties and common rules

### Create a "Direct reports" rule

You can create a group containing all direct reports of a manager. When the manager's direct reports change in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

The direct reports rule is constructed using the following syntax:

```
Direct Reports for "{objectID_of_manager}"
```

Here's an example of a valid rule where "62e19b97-8b3d-4d4a-a106-4ce66896a863" is the objectID of the manager:

```
Direct Reports for "62e19b97-8b3d-4d4a-a106-4ce66896a863"
```

The following tips can help you use the rule properly.

- The **Manager ID** is the object ID of the manager. It can be found in the manager's **Profile**.
- For the rule to work, make sure the **Manager** property is set correctly for users in your organization. You can check the current value in the user's **Profile**.
- This rule supports only the manager's direct reports. In other words, you can't create a group with the manager's direct reports *and* their reports.
- This rule can't be combined with any other membership rules.

### Create an "All users" rule

You can create a group containing all users within an organization using a membership rule. When users are added or removed from the organization in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

The "All users" rule is constructed using single expression using the -ne operator and the null value. This rule adds B2B guest users as well as member users to the group.

```
user.objectId -ne null
```
If you want your group to exclude guest users and include only members of your organization, you can use the following syntax:

```
(user.objectId -ne null) -and (user.userType -eq "Member")
```

### Create an "All devices" rule

You can create a group containing all devices within an organization using a membership rule. When devices are added or removed from the organization in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

The "All Devices" rule is constructed using single expression using the -ne operator and the null value:

```
device.objectId -ne null
```

## Extension properties and custom extension properties

Extension attributes and custom extension properties are supported as string properties in dynamic membership rules. [Extension attributes](/graph/api/resources/onpremisesextensionattributes?view=graph-rest-1.0) are synced from on-premises Window Server AD and take the format of "ExtensionAttributeX", where X equals 1 - 15. Here's an example of a rule that uses an extension attribute as a property:

```
(user.extensionAttribute15 -eq "Marketing")
```

[Custom extension properties](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-feature-directory-extensions.md) are synced from on-premises Windows Server AD or from a connected SaaS application and are of the format of `user.extension_[GUID]_[Attribute]`, where:

* [GUID] is the unique identifier in Azure AD for the application that created the property in Azure AD
* [Attribute] is the name of the property as it was created

An example of a rule that uses a custom extension property is:

```
user.extension_c272a57b722d4eb29bfe327874ae79cb_OfficeNumber -eq "123"
```

The custom property name can be found in the directory by querying a user's property using Graph Explorer and searching for the property name. Also, you can now select **Get custom extension properties** link in the dynamic user group rule builder to enter a unique app ID and receive the full list of custom extension properties to use when creating a dynamic membership rule. This list can also be refreshed to get any new custom extension properties for that app.

## Rules for devices

You can also create a rule that selects device objects for membership in a group. You can't have both users and devices as group members. 

> [!NOTE]
> The **organizationalUnit** attribute is no longer listed and should not be used. This string is set by Intune in specific cases but is not recognized by Azure AD, so no devices are added to groups based on this attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> systemlabels is a read-only attribute that cannot be set with Intune.
>
> For Windows 10, the correct format of the deviceOSVersion attribute is as follows: (device.deviceOSVersion -eq "10.0.17763"). The formatting can be validated with the Get-MsolDevice PowerShell cmdlet.

The following device attributes can be used.

 Device attribute  | Values | Example
 ----- | ----- | ----------------
 accountEnabled | true false | (device.accountEnabled -eq true)
 displayName | any string value |(device.displayName -eq "Rob iPhone")
 deviceOSType | any string value | (device.deviceOSType -eq "iPad") -or (device.deviceOSType -eq "iPhone")<br>(device.deviceOSType -contains "AndroidEnterprise")<br>(device.deviceOSType -eq "AndroidForWork")
 deviceOSVersion | any string value | (device.deviceOSVersion -eq "9.1")
 deviceCategory | a valid device category name | (device.deviceCategory -eq "BYOD")
 deviceManufacturer | any string value | (device.deviceManufacturer -eq "Samsung")
 deviceModel | any string value | (device.deviceModel -eq "iPad Air")
 deviceOwnership | Personal, Company, Unknown | (device.deviceOwnership -eq "Company")
 enrollmentProfileName | Apple Device Enrollment Profile name, Android Enterprise Corporate-owned dedicated device Enrollment Profile name, or Windows Autopilot profile name | (device.enrollmentProfileName -eq "DEP iPhones")
 isRooted | true false | (device.isRooted -eq true)
 managementType | MDM (for mobile devices)<br>PC (for computers managed by the Intune PC agent) | (device.managementType -eq "MDM")
 deviceId | a valid Azure AD device ID | (device.deviceId -eq "d4fe7726-5966-431c-b3b8-cddc8fdb717d")
 objectId | a valid Azure AD object ID |  (device.objectId -eq "76ad43c9-32c5-45e8-a272-7b58b58f596d")
 devicePhysicalIds | any string value used by Autopilot, such as all Autopilot devices, OrderID, or PurchaseOrderID  | (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any _ -contains "[ZTDId]") (device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ -eq "[OrderID]:179887111881") (device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ -eq "[PurchaseOrderId]:76222342342")
 systemLabels | any string matching the Intune device property for tagging Modern Workplace devices | (device.systemLabels -contains "M365Managed")

> [!Note]  
> For the deviceOwnership when creating Dynamic Groups for devices you need to set the value equal to "Company". On Intune the device ownership is represented instead as Corporate. Refer to [OwnerTypes](/intune/reports-ref-devices#ownertypes) for more details.
