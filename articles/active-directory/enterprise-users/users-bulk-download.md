# Download a list of users in Azure Active Directory portal

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports bulk user import (create) operations.

## Required permissions

To download the list of users from the Azure AD admin center, you must be signed in with a user assigned to one or more organization-level administrator roles in Azure AD (User Administrator is the minimum role required). Guest inviter and application developer are not considered administrator roles.

## To download a list of users

1. [Sign in to your Azure AD organization](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with a User administrator account in the organization.
2. Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users. Then select the users you wish to include in the download by ticking the box in the left column next to each user. Note: At this time, there is no way to select all users for export. Each one must be individually selected.
3. In Azure AD, select **Users** > **Download users**.
4. On the **Download users** page, select **Start** to receive a CSV file listing user profile properties. If there are errors, you can download and view the results file on the Bulk operation results page. The file contains the reason for each error.
