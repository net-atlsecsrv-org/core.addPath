#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to learn how how to use the AcquireTokenSilent method so I can acquire tokens from the cache.

# Get a token from the token cache using MSAL.NET

When you acquire an access token using Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET), the token is cached. When the application needs a token, it should first call the `AcquireTokenSilent` method to verify if an acceptable token is in the cache. In many cases, it's possible to acquire another token with more scopes based on a token in the cache. It's also possible to refresh a token when it's getting close to expiration (as the token cache also contains a refresh token).

The recommended pattern is to call the `AcquireTokenSilent` method first.  If `AcquireTokenSilent` fails, then acquire a token using other methods.

In the following example, the application first attempts to acquire a token from the token cache.  If a `MsalUiRequiredException` exception is thrown, the application acquires a token interactively. 

```csharp
AuthenticationResult result = null;
var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

try
{
 result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
        .ExecuteAsync();
}
catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex)
{
 // A MsalUiRequiredException happened on AcquireTokenSilent.
 // This indicates you need to call AcquireTokenInteractive to acquire a token
 System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"MsalUiRequiredException: {ex.Message}");

 try
 {
    result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
          .ExecuteAsync();
 }
 catch (MsalException msalex)
 {
    ResultText.Text = $"Error Acquiring Token:{System.Environment.NewLine}{msalex}";
 }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
 ResultText.Text = $"Error Acquiring Token Silently:{System.Environment.NewLine}{ex}";
 return;
}

if (result != null)
{
 string accessToken = result.AccessToken;
 // Use the token
}
```
