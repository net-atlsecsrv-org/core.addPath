# Scopes for a Web API accepting v1.0 tokens

OAuth2 permissions are permission scopes that a Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for developers (v1.0) web API (resource) application exposes to client applications. These permission scopes may be granted to client applications during consent. See the section about `oauth2Permissions` in the [Azure Active Directory application manifest reference](reference-app-manifest.md#manifest-reference).

## Scopes to request access to specific OAuth2 permissions of a v1.0 application

To acquire tokens for specific scopes of a v1.0 application (for example the Azure AD graph, which is https://graph.windows.net), create scopes by concatenating a desired resource identifier with a desired OAuth2 permission for that resource.

For example, to access on behalf of the user a v1.0 web API where the app ID URI is `ResourceId`:

```csharp
var scopes = new [] {  ResourceId+"/user_impersonation"};
```

```javascript
var scopes = [ ResourceId + "/user_impersonation"];
```

To read and write with MSAL.NET Azure AD using the Azure AD Graph API (https:\//graph.windows.net/), you need to create a list of scopes as shown in the following examples:

```csharp
string ResourceId = "https://graph.windows.net/";
var scopes = new [] { ResourceId + "Directory.Read", ResourceID + "Directory.Write"}
```

```javascript
var ResourceId = "https://graph.windows.net/";
var scopes = [ ResourceId + "Directory.Read", ResourceID + "Directory.Write"];
```

To write the scope corresponding to the Azure Resource Manager API (https:\//management.core.windows.net/), you need to request the following scope (note the two slashes):

```csharp
var scopes = new[] {"https://management.core.windows.net//user_impersonation"};
var result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes).ExecuteAsync();

// then call the API: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions?api-version=2016-09-01
```

> [!NOTE]
> You need to use two slashes because the Azure Resource Manager API expects a slash in its audience claim (aud), and then there is a slash to separate the API name from the scope.

The logic used by Azure AD is the following:

- For ADAL (Azure AD v1.0) endpoint with a v1.0 access token (the only possible), aud=resource
- For MSAL (Microsoft identity platform (v2.0)) endpoint asking an access token for a resource accepting v2.0 tokens, `aud=resource.AppId`
- For MSAL (v2.0 endpoint) asking an access token for a resource that accepts a v1.0 access token (which is the case above), Azure AD parses the desired audience from the requested scope by taking everything before the last slash and using it as the resource identifier. Therefore, if https:\//database.windows.net expects an audience of "https:\//database.windows.net/", you'll need to request a scope of "https:\//database.windows.net//.default". See also GitHub issue [#747: Resource url's trailing slash is omitted, which caused sql auth failure](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/747).

## Scopes to request access to all the permissions of a v1.0 application

If you want to acquire a token for all the static scopes of a v1.0 application, append ".default" to the app ID URI of the API:

```csharp
ResourceId = "someAppIDURI";
var scopes = new [] {  ResourceId+"/.default"};
```

```javascript
var ResourceId = "someAppIDURI";
var scopes = [ ResourceId + "/.default"];
```

## Scopes to request for a client credential flow/daemon app

In the case of client credential flow, the scope to pass would also be `/.default`. This tells to Azure AD: "all the app-level permissions that the admin has consented to in the application registration.
