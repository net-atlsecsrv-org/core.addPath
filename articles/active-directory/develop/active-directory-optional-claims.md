# How to: Provide optional claims to your Azure AD app

Application developers can use optional claims in their Azure AD apps to specify which claims they want in tokens sent to their application. 

You can use optional claims to:

- Select additional claims to include in tokens for your application.
- Change the behavior of certain claims that Azure AD returns in tokens.
- Add and access custom claims for your application.

For the lists of standard claims, see the [access token](access-tokens.md) and [id_token](id-tokens.md) claims documentation. 

While optional claims are supported in both v1.0 and v2.0 format tokens, as well as SAML tokens, they provide most of their value when moving from v1.0 to v2.0. One of the goals of the [v2.0 Microsoft identity platform endpoint](active-directory-appmodel-v2-overview.md) is smaller token sizes to ensure optimal performance by clients. As a result, several claims formerly included in the access and ID tokens are no longer present in v2.0 tokens and must be asked for specifically on a per-application basis.

**Table 1: Applicability**

| Account Type | v1.0 tokens | v2.0 tokens  |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Personal Microsoft account  | N/A  | Supported |
| Azure AD account      | Supported | Supported |

## v1.0 and v2.0 optional claims set

The set of optional claims available by default for applications to use are listed below. To add custom optional claims for your application, see [Directory Extensions](#configuring-directory-extension-optional-claims), below. When adding claims to the **access token**, this will apply to access tokens requested *for* the application (a web API), not those *by* the application. This ensures that no matter the client accessing your API, the right data is present in the access token they use to authenticate against your API.

> [!NOTE]
> The majority of these claims can be included in JWTs for v1.0 and v2.0 tokens, but not SAML tokens, except where noted in the Token Type column. Consumer accounts support a subset of these claims, marked in the "User Type" column.  Many of the claims listed do not apply to consumer users (they have no tenant, so `tenant_ctry` has no value).  

**Table 2: v1.0 and v2.0 optional claim set**

| Name                       |  Description   | Token Type | User Type | Notes  |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| `auth_time`                | Time when the user last authenticated. See OpenID Connect spec.| JWT        |           |  |

| `enfpolids`                | Enforced policy IDs. A list of the policy IDs that were evaluated for the current user. | JWT |  |  |
| `vnet`                     | VNET specifier information. | JWT        |           |      |
| `fwd`                      | IP address.| JWT    |   | Adds the original IPv4 address of the requesting client (when inside a VNET) |
| `ctry`                     | User’s country | JWT |  | Azure AD returns the `ctry` optional claim if it's present and the value of the claim is a standard two-letter country code, such as FR, JP, SZ, and so on. |
| `tenant_ctry`              | Resource tenant’s country | JWT | | |
| `xms_pdl`		     | Preferred data location   | JWT | | For Multi-Geo tenants, this is the 3-letter code showing the geographic region the user is in. For more info, see the [Azure AD Connect documentation about preferred data location](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-preferreddatalocation).<br/>For example: `APC` for Asia Pacific. |
| `xms_pl`                   | User preferred language  | JWT ||The user’s preferred language, if set. Sourced from their home tenant, in guest access scenarios. Formatted LL-CC (“en-us”). |

| `email`                    | The addressable email for this user, if the user has one.  | JWT, SAML | MSA, Azure AD | This value is included by default if the user is a guest in the tenant.  For managed users (those inside the tenant), it must be requested through this optional claim or, on v2.0 only, with the OpenID scope.  For managed users, the email address must be set in the [Office admin portal](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/users).| 
| `groups`| Optional formatting for group claims |JWT, SAML| |Used in conjunction with the GroupMembershipClaims setting in the [application manifest](reference-app-manifest.md), which must be set as well. For details see [Group claims](#Configuring-group-optional claims) below. For more information on group claims see [How to configure group claims](../hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md)
| `acct`   		     | Users account status in tenant. | JWT, SAML | | If the user is a member of the tenant, the value is `0`. If they are a guest, the value is `1`. |
| `upn`                      | UserPrincipalName claim. | JWT, SAML  |           | Although this claim is automatically included, you can specify it as an optional claim to attach additional properties to modify its behavior in the guest user case.  |

### v2.0 optional claims

These claims are always included in v1.0 Azure AD tokens, but not included in v2.0 tokens unless requested. These claims are only applicable for JWTs (ID tokens and Access Tokens). 

**Table 3: v2.0-only optional claims**

| JWT Claim     | Name                            | Description                                | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------|-------|
| `ipaddr`      | IP Address                      | The IP address the client logged in from.   |       |
| `onprem_sid`  | On-Premises Security Identifier |                                             |       |
| `pwd_exp`     | Password Expiration Time        | The datetime at which the password expires. |       |
| `pwd_url`     | Change Password URL             | A URL that the user can visit to change their password.   |   |
| `in_corp`     | Inside Corporate Network        | Signals if the client is logging in from the corporate network. If they're not, the claim isn't included.   |  Based off of the [trusted IPs](../authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#trusted-ips) settings in MFA.    |
| `nickname`    | Nickname                        | An additional name for the user, separate from first or last name. | 
| `family_name` | Last Name                       | Provides the last name, surname, or family name of the user as defined in the user object. <br>"family_name":"Miller" | Supported in MSA and Azure AD   |
| `given_name`  | First name                      | Provides the first or "given" name of the user, as set on the user object.<br>"given_name": "Frank"                   | Supported in MSA and Azure AD  |
| `upn`         | User Principal Name | An identifer for the user that can be used with the username_hint parameter.  Not a durable identifier for the user and should not be used to key data. | See [additional properties](#additional-properties-of-optional-claims) below for configuration of the claim. |

### Additional properties of optional claims

Some optional claims can be configured to change the way the claim is returned. These additional properties are mostly used to help migration of on-premises applications with different data expectations (for example, `include_externally_authenticated_upn_without_hash` helps with clients that cannot handle hash marks (`#`) in the UPN)

**Table 4: Values for configuring optional claims**

| Property name  | Additional Property name | Description |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| `upn`          |                          | Can be used for both SAML and JWT responses, and for v1.0 and v2.0 tokens. |
|                | `include_externally_authenticated_upn`  | Includes the guest UPN as stored in the resource tenant. For example, `foo_hometenant.com#EXT#@resourcetenant.com` |             
|                | `include_externally_authenticated_upn_without_hash` | Same as above, except that the hash marks (`#`) are replaced with underscores (`_`) , for example `foo_hometenant.com_EXT_@resourcetenant.com` |

#### Additional properties example

```json
 "optionalClaims": 
   {
       "idToken": [ 
             { 
                "name": "upn", 
	     	"essential": false,
                "additionalProperties": [ "include_externally_authenticated_upn"]  
              }
        ]
}
```

This OptionalClaims object causes the ID token returned to the client to include another upn with the additional home tenant and resource tenant information. This will only change the `upn` claim in the token if the user is a guest in the tenant (that uses a different IDP for authentication). 

## Configuring optional claims

You can configure optional claims for your application by modifying the application manifest (See example below). For more info, see the [Understanding the Azure AD application manifest article](reference-app-manifest.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access tokens are **always** generated using the manifest of the resource, not the client.  So in the request `...scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read...` the resource is Graph.  Thus, the access token is created using the Graph manifest, not the client's manifest.  Changing the manifest for your application will never cause tokens for Graph to look different.  In order to validate that your `accessToken` changes are in effect, request a token for your application, not another app.  

**Sample schema:**

```json
"optionalClaims":  
   {
      "idToken": [
            {
                  "name": "auth_time", 
                  "essential": false
             }
      ],
      "accessToken": [
             {
                    "name": "ipaddr", 
                    "essential": false
              }
      ],
      "saml2Token": [
              {
                    "name": "upn", 
                    "essential": false
               },
               {
                    "name": "extension_ab603c56068041afb2f6832e2a17e237_skypeId",
                    "source": "user", 
                    "essential": false
               }
       ]
   }
```

### OptionalClaims type

Declares the optional claims requested by an application. An application can configure optional claims to be returned in each of three types of tokens (ID token, access token, SAML 2 token) it can receive from the security token service. The application can configure a different set of optional claims to be returned in each token type. The OptionalClaims property of the Application entity is an OptionalClaims object.

**Table 5: OptionalClaims type properties**

| Name        | Type                       | Description                                           |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `idToken`     | Collection (OptionalClaim) | The optional claims returned in the JWT ID token. |
| `accessToken` | Collection (OptionalClaim) | The optional claims returned in the JWT access token. |
| `saml2Token`  | Collection (OptionalClaim) | The optional claims returned in the SAML token.   |

### OptionalClaim type

Contains an optional claim associated with an application or a service principal. The idToken, accessToken, and saml2Token properties of the [OptionalClaims](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ad/graph/api/entity-and-complex-type-reference#optionalclaims-type) type is a collection of OptionalClaim.
If supported by a specific claim, you can also modify the behavior of the OptionalClaim using the AdditionalProperties field.

**Table 6: OptionalClaim type properties**

| Name                 | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                 | Edm.String              | The name of the optional claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `source`               | Edm.String              | The source (directory object) of the claim. There are predefined claims and user-defined claims from extension properties. If the source value is null, the claim is a predefined optional claim. If the source value is user, the value in the name property is the extension property from the user object. |
| `essential`            | Edm.Boolean             | If the value is true, the claim specified by the client is necessary to ensure a smooth authorization experience for the specific task requested by the end user. The default value is false.                                                                                                             |
| `additionalProperties` | Collection (Edm.String) | Additional properties of the claim. If a property exists in this collection, it modifies the behavior of the optional claim specified in the name property.                                                                                                                                               |
## Configuring directory extension optional claims

In addition to the standard optional claims set, you can also configure tokens to include directory schema extensions. For more info, see [Directory schema extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-directory-schema-extensions). This feature is useful for attaching additional user information that your app can use – for example, an additional identifier or important configuration option that the user has set. 

> [!Note]
> - Directory schema extensions are an Azure AD-only feature, so if your application manifest requests a custom extension and an MSA user logs into your app, these extensions will not be returned.
> - Azure AD optional claims only work with the Azure AD extension and doesn't work with the Microsoft Graph directory extension. Both APIs require the `Directory.ReadWriteAll` permission, which can only be consented by admins.

### Directory extension formatting

For extension attributes, use the full name of the extension (in the format: `extension_<appid>_<attributename>`) in the application manifest. The `<appid>` must match the ID of the application requesting the claim. 

Within the JWT, these claims will be emitted with the following name format:  `extn.<attributename>`.

Within the SAML tokens, these claims will be emitted with the following URI format: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/extn.<attributename>`

## Configuring group optional claims

   > [!NOTE]
   > The ability to emit group names for users and groups synced from on-premises is Public Preview.

This section covers the configuration options under optional claims for changing the group attributes used in group claims from the default group objectID to attributes synced from on-premises Windows Active Directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See [Configure group claims for applications with Azure AD](../hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md) for more details including important caveats for the public preview of group claims from on-premises attributes.

1. In the portal ->Azure Active Directory -> Application Registrations->Select Application->Manifest

2. Enable group membership claims by changing the groupMembershipClaim

   The valid values are:

   - "All"
   - "SecurityGroup"
   - "DistributionList"
   - "DirectoryRole"

   For example:

   ```json
   "groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup"
   ```

   By default Group ObjectIDs will be emitted in the group claim value.  To modify the claim value to contain on premises group attributes, or to change the claim type to role, use OptionalClaims configuration as follows:

3. Set group name configuration optional claims.

   If you want to groups in the token to contain the on premises AD group attributes in the optional claims section specify which token type optional claim should be applied to, the name of optional claim requested and any additional properties desired.  Multiple token types can be listed:

   - idToken for the OIDC ID token
   - accessToken for the OAuth/OIDC access token
   - Saml2Token for SAML tokens.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Saml2Token type applies to both SAML1.1 and SAML2.0 format tokens

   For each relevant token type, modify the groups claim to use the OptionalClaims section in the manifest. The OptionalClaims schema is as follows:

   ```json
   {
   "name": "groups",
   "source": null,
   "essential": false,
   "additionalProperties": []
   }
   ```

   | Optional claims schema | Value |
   |----------|-------------|
   | **name:** | Must be "groups" |
   | **source:** | Not used. Omit or specify null |
   | **essential:** | Not used. Omit or specify false |
   | **additionalProperties:** | List of additional properties.  Valid options are "sam_account_name", “dns_domain_and_sam_account_name”, “netbios_domain_and_sam_account_name”, "emit_as_roles" |

   In additionalProperties only one of "sam_account_name", “dns_domain_and_sam_account_name”, “netbios_domain_and_sam_account_name” are required.  If more than one is present, the first is used and any others ignored.

   Some applications require group information about the user in the role claim.  To change the claim type to from a group claim to a role claim, add “emit_as_roles” to additional properties.  The group values will be emitted in the role claim.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If "emit_as_roles" is used any Application Roles configured that the user is assigned will not appear in the role claim

**Examples:**
Emit groups as group names in OAuth access tokens in dnsDomainName\sAMAccountName format

```json
"optionalClaims": {
    "accessToken": [{
        "name": "groups",
        "additionalProperties": ["dns_domain_and_sam_account_name"]
    }]
}
 ```

To emit group names to be returned in netbiosDomain\sAMAccountName format as the roles claim in SAML and OIDC ID Tokens:

```json
"optionalClaims": {
    "saml2Token": [{
        "name": "groups",
        "additionalProperties": ["netbios_name_and_sam_account_name", "emit_as_roles"]
    }],

    "idToken": [{
        "name": "groups",
        "additionalProperties": ["netbios_name_and_sam_account_name", "emit_as_roles"]
    }]
 }

 ```

## Optional claims example

In this section, you can walk through a scenario to see how you can use the optional claims feature for your application.
There are multiple options available for updating the properties on an application’s identity configuration to enable and configure optional claims:
-	You can modify the application manifest. The example below will use this method to do the configuration. Read the [Understanding the Azure AD application manifest document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-manifest) first for an introduction to the manifest.
-	It's also possible to write an application that uses the [Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api) to update your application. The [Entity and complex type reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ad/graph/api/entity-and-complex-type-reference#optionalclaims-type) in the Graph API reference guide can help you with configuring the optional claims.

**Example:** 
In the example below, you will modify an application’s manifest to add claims to access, ID, and SAML tokens intended for the application.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. After you've authenticated, choose your Azure AD tenant by selecting it from the top right corner of the page.
1. Select **App Registrations** from the left hand side.
1. Find the application you want to configure optional claims for in the list and click on it.
1. From the application page, click **Manifest** to open the inline manifest editor. 
1. You can directly edit the manifest using this editor. The manifest follows the schema for the [Application entity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest), and auto-formats the manifest once saved. New elements will be added to the `OptionalClaims` property.

    ```json
      "optionalClaims": 
      {
            "idToken": [ 
                  { 
                        "name": "upn", 
                        "essential": false, 
                        "additionalProperties": [ "include_externally_authenticated_upn"]  
                  }
            ],
            "accessToken": [ 
                  {
                        "name": "auth_time", 
                        "essential": false
                  }
            ],
            "saml2Token": [ 
                  { 
                        "name": "extension_ab603c56068041afb2f6832e2a17e237_skypeId",
                        "source": "user", 
                        "essential": true
                  }
            ]

    In this case, different optional claims were added to each type of token that the application can receive. The ID tokens will now contain the UPN for federated users in the full form (`<upn>_<homedomain>#EXT#@<resourcedomain>`). The access tokens that other clients request for this application will now include the auth_time claim. The SAML tokens will now contain the skypeId directory schema extension (in this example, the app ID for this app is ab603c56068041afb2f6832e2a17e237). The SAML tokens will expose the Skype ID as `extension_skypeId`.
