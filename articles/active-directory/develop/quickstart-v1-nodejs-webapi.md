# Quickstart: Secure a Web API with Azure Active Directory

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-develop-applies-v1](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-applies-v1.md)]

[Microsoft identity platform](v2-overview.md) is an evolution of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) developer platform. It allows developers to build applications that sign in all Microsoft identities and get tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as Microsoft Graph or APIs that developers have built.

## Next steps

See the [Azure Active Directory OIDC Node.js Web Sample](https://github.com/azureadquickstarts/appmodelv2-webapp-openidconnect-nodejs) which demonstrates how to set up OpenId Connect authentication with Azure AD v2.0 in a web application built using Node.js with Express. It is designed to run on any platform.
