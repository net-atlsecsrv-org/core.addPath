# Logging
Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) apps to generate log messages that can help diagnose issues and provide details. An app can configure logging with a few lines of code, and have custom control over the level of detail and whether or not personal and organizational data is logged. It is recommended that you set an MSAL logging callback and provide a way for users to submit logs when they are having authentication issues.

## Logging levels

MSAL's logger allows for several levels of detail to be capture:

- Error: Indicates something has gone wrong and an error was generated. Use for debugging and identifying problems.
- Warning: Events that are of question and the app needs more information on. There hasn't necessarily been an error or failure, but intended for diagnostic and pinpointing problems.
- Info: MSAL will log events intended for informational purposes not necessarily intended for debugging.
- Verbose: Default. MSAL will log a large amount of information and give full details into what library behavior.

## Personal and organizational data
By default, the MSAL logger does not capture any highly sensitive personal or organizational data. The library provides you the option to enable logging personal and organizational data if you decide to do so.

## Logging in MSAL.NET

 > [!NOTE]
 > For more information about MSAL.NET, check out the [MSAL.NET wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki). Get samples of MSAL.NET logging and more. 
 
In MSAL 3.x, logging is set per application at app creation using the `.WithLogging` builder modifier. This method takes optional parameters:

- *Level* enables you to decide which level of logging you want. Setting it to Errors will only get errors
- *PiiLoggingEnabled* enables you to log personal and organizational data if set to true. By default this is set to false, so that your application does not log personal data.
- *LogCallback* is set to a delegate that does the logging. If *PiiLoggingEnabled* is true, this method will receive the messages twice: once with the *containsPii* parameter equals false and the message without personal data, and a second time with the *containsPii* parameter equals to true and the message might contain personal data. In some cases (when the message does not contain personal data), the message will be the same.
- *DefaultLoggingEnabled* enables the default logging for the platform. By default it's false. If you set it to true it uses Event Tracing in Desktop/UWP applications, NSLog on iOS and logcat on Android.

```csharp
class Program
 {
  private static void Log(LogLevel level, string message, bool containsPii)
  {
     if (containsPii)
     {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
     }
     Console.WriteLine($"{level} {message}");
     Console.ResetColor();
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var scopes = new string[] { "User.Read" };

    var application = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create("<clientID>")
                      .WithLogging(Log, LogLevel.Info, true)
                      .Build();

    AuthenticationResult result = application.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                                             .ExecuteAsync().Result;
  }
 }
 ```

 ## Logging in MSAL.js

 You can enable logging in MSAL.js by passing a logger object during the configuration for creating a `UserAgentApplication` instance. This logger object has the following properties:

- *localCallback*: a Callback instance that can be provided by the developer to consume and publish logs in a custom manner. Implement the localCallback method depending on how you want to redirect logs.

- *level* (optional): the configurable log level. The supported log levels are: Error, Warning, Info, Verbose. Default value is Info.

- *piiLoggingEnabled* (optional): enables you to log personal and organizational data if set to true. By default this is set to false so that your application does not log personal data. Personal data logs are never written to default outputs like Console, Logcat, or NSLog. Default is set to false.

- *correlationId* (optional): a unique identifier, used to map the request with the response for debugging purposes. Defaults to RFC4122 version 4 guid (128 bits).

```javascript

function loggerCallback(logLevel, message, containsPii) {
   console.log(message);
}

var msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: “abcd-ef12-gh34-ikkl-ashdjhlhsdg”,
    },
    system: {
        logger: {
            localCallback: loggerCallback,
            level: Msal.LogLevel.Verbose,
            piiLoggingEnabled: false,
            correlationId: '1234'
        }
    }
}

var UserAgentApplication = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);
```
