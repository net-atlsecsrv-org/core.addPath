# Azure Active Directory authentication protocols

The topics in this section describe the supported protocols and their implementation in Azure AD. The topics included a review of supported claim types, an introduction to the use of federation metadata, detailed OAuth 2.0. and SAML 2.0 protocol reference documentation, and a troubleshooting section.
