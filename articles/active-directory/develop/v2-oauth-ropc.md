# Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials

Microsoft identity platform supports the [OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3), which allows an application to sign in the user by directly handling their password.  This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application.  When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead to [acquire tokens and call secured web APIs](authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md#scenarios-and-supported-authentication-flows).  Also take a look at the [sample apps that use MSAL](sample-v2-code.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft recommends you do _not_ use the ROPC flow. In most scenarios, more secure alternatives are available and recommended. This flow requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks which are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows can't be used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * The Microsoft identity platform endpoint only supports ROPC for Azure AD tenants, not personal accounts. This means that you must use a tenant-specific endpoint (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId_or_Name}`) or the `organizations` endpoint.
> * Personal accounts that are invited to an Azure AD tenant can't use ROPC.
> * Accounts that don't have passwords can't sign in through ROPC. For this scenario, we recommend that you use a different flow for your app instead.
> * If users need to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to the application, they will be blocked instead.
> * ROPC is not supported in [hybrid identity federation](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-fed) scenarios (for example, Azure AD and ADFS used to authenticate on-premises accounts). If users are full-page redirected to an on-premises identity providers, Azure AD is not able to test the username and password against that identity provider. [Pass-through authentication](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-pta) is supported with ROPC, however.

## Protocol diagram

The following diagram shows the ROPC flow.

![Diagram showing the resource owner password credential flow](./media/v2-oauth2-ropc/v2-oauth-ropc.svg)

## Authorization request

The ROPC flow is a single request: it sends the client identification and user's credentials to the IDP, and then receives tokens in return. The client must request the user's email address (UPN) and password before doing so. Immediately after a successful request, the client should securely release the user's credentials from memory. It must never save them.

> [!TIP]
> Try executing this request in Postman!
> [![Try running this request in Postman](./media/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow/runInPostman.png)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f77994d794bab767596d)

POST {tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
Host: login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&scope=user.read%20openid%20profile%20offline_access
&username=MyUsername@myTenant.com
&password=SuperS3cret
&grant_type=password
```

| Parameter | Condition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenant` | Required | The directory tenant that you want to log the user into. This can be in GUID or friendly name format. This parameter can't be set to `common` or `consumers`, but may be set to `organizations`. |
| `client_id` | Required | The Application (client) ID that the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page assigned to your app. | 
| `grant_type` | Required | Must be set to `password`. |
| `username` | Required | The user's email address. |
| `password` | Required | The user's password. |
| `scope` | Recommended | A space-separated list of [scopes](v2-permissions-and-consent.md), or permissions, that the app requires. In an interactive flow, the admin or the user must consent to these scopes ahead of time. |
| `client_secret`| Sometimes required | If your app is a public client, then the `client_secret` or `client_assertion` cannot be included.  If the app is a confidential client, then it must be included. | 
| `client_assertion` | Sometimes required | A different form of `client_secret`, generated using a certificate.  See [certificate credentials](active-directory-certificate-credentials.md) for more details. | 

### Successful authentication response

The following example shows a successful token response:

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "User.Read profile openid email",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...",
    "refresh_token": "AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGAMxZGUTdM0t4B4...",
    "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJhdWQiOiIyZDRkMTFhMi1mODE0LTQ2YTctOD..."
}
```

| Parameter | Format | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `token_type` | String | Always set to `Bearer`. |
| `scope` | Space separated strings | If an access token was returned, this parameter lists the scopes the access token is valid for. |
| `expires_in`| int | Number of seconds that the included access token is valid for. |
| `access_token`| Opaque string | Issued for the [scopes](v2-permissions-and-consent.md) that were requested. |
| `id_token` | JWT | Issued if the original `scope` parameter included the `openid` scope. |
| `refresh_token` | Opaque string | Issued if the original `scope` parameter included `offline_access`. |

You can use the refresh token to acquire new access tokens and refresh tokens using the same flow described in the [OAuth Code flow documentation](v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md#refresh-the-access-token).

### Error response

If the user hasn't provided the correct username or password, or the client hasn't received the requested consent, authentication will fail.

| Error | Description | Client action |
|------ | ----------- | -------------|
| `invalid_grant` | The authentication failed | The credentials were incorrect or the client doesn't have consent for the requested scopes. If the scopes aren't granted, a `consent_required` error will be returned. If this occurs, the client should send the user to an interactive prompt using a webview or browser. |
| `invalid_request` | The request was improperly constructed | The grant type isn't supported on the `/common` or `/consumers` authentication contexts.  Use `/organizations` or a tenant ID instead. |
