# Register mobile apps that call web APIs

This article contains instructions to help you register a mobile application that you're creating.

## Supported account types

The account types that your mobile applications support depend on the experience that you want to enable and the flows that you want to use.

### Audience for interactive token acquisition

Most mobile applications use interactive authentication. If your app uses this form of authentication, you can sign in users from any [account type](quickstart-register-app.md).

### Audience for Integrated Windows authentication, username-password, and B2C

If you have a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, you can use Integrated Windows authentication to sign in users. To use Integrated Windows authentication or username-password authentication, your application needs to sign in users in your own line-of-business (LOB) developer tenant. In an independent software vendor (ISV) scenario, your application can sign in users in Azure Active Directory organizations. These authentication flows aren't supported for Microsoft personal accounts.

You can also sign in users by using social identities that pass a B2C authority and policy. To use this method, you can use only interactive authentication and username-password authentication. Username-password authentication is currently supported only on Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, and UWP.

For more information, see [Scenarios and supported authentication flows](authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md#scenarios-and-supported-authentication-flows) and [Scenarios and supported platforms and languages](authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md#scenarios-and-supported-platforms-and-languages).

## Platform configuration and redirect URIs

### Interactive authentication

When you build a mobile app that uses interactive authentication, the most critical registration step is the redirect URI. You can set interactive authentication through the [platform configuration on the **Authentication** blade](https://aka.ms/MobileAppReg).

This experience will enable your app to get single sign-on (SSO) through Microsoft Authenticator (and Intune Company Portal on Android). It will also support device management policies.

The app registration portal provides a preview experience to help you compute the brokered reply URI for iOS and Android applications:

1. In the app registration portal, select **Authentication** > **Try out the new experience**.

2. Select **Add a platform**.

3. When the list of platforms is supported, select **iOS**.

4. Enter your bundle ID, and then select **Register**.

   ![Enter your bundle ID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13203188/60799477-7eaba580-a173-11e9-9f8b-431f5b09344e.png)

When you complete the steps, the redirect URI is computed for you, as in the following image.

If you prefer to manually configure the redirect URI, you can do so through the application manifest. Here's the recommended format for the manifest:

- **iOS**: `msauth.<BUNDLE_ID>://auth`
  - For example, enter `msauth.com.yourcompany.appName://auth`
- **Android**: `msauth://<PACKAGE_NAME>/<SIGNATURE_HASH>`
  - You can generate the Android signature hash by using the release key or debug key through the KeyTool command.

### Username-password authentication

If your app uses only username-password authentication, you don't need to register a redirect URI for your application. This flow does a round trip to the Microsoft identity platform version 2.0 endpoint. Your application won't be called back on any specific URI.

However, you need to identify your application as a public client application. To do so:

1. Still in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your app in **App registrations**, and then select **Authentication**.
1. In **Advanced settings** > **Allow public client flows** > **Enable the following mobile and desktop flows:**, select **Yes**.

## API permissions

Mobile applications call APIs on behalf of the signed-in user. Your app needs to request delegated permissions. These permissions are also called scopes. Depending on the experience that you want, you can request delegated permissions statically through the Azure portal. Or you can request them dynamically at runtime.

By statically registering permissions, you allow administrators to easily approve your app. Static registration is recommended.
