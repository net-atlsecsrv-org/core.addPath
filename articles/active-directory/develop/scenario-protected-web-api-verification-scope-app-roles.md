# Protected web API: Adding authorization to your API

This article describes how you can add authorization to your web API. This protection ensures that the API is called only by:

- Applications on behalf of users who have the right scopes.
- Daemon apps that have the right application roles.

> - [ASP.NET Web API sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnet-webapi-onbehalfof/blob/dfd0115533d5a230baff6a3259c76cf117568bd9/TodoListService/Controllers/TodoListController.cs#L48)

To protect an ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core web API, you'll need to add the `[Authorize]` attribute on one of these:

- The controller itself, if you want all the actions of the controller to be protected
- The individual controller action for your API

```CSharp
    [Authorize]
    public class TodoListController : Controller
    {
     ...
    }
```

But this protection isn't enough. It guarantees only that ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core will validate the token. Your API needs to verify that the token used to call your web API was requested with the claims it expects, in particular:

- The *scopes*, if the API is called on behalf of a user.
- The *app roles*, if the API can be called from a daemon app.

## Verifying scopes in APIs called on behalf of users

If your API is called by a client app on behalf of a user, it needs to request a bearer token that has specific scopes for the API. (See [Code configuration | Bearer token](scenario-protected-web-api-app-configuration.md#bearer-token).)

```CSharp
[Authorize]
public class TodoListController : Controller
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The web API will accept only tokens 1) for users, 2) that have the `access_as_user` scope for
    /// this API.
    /// </summary>
    const string scopeRequiredByAPI = "access_as_user";

    // GET: api/values
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<TodoItem> Get()
    {
        VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope(scopeRequiredByAPI);
        // Do the work and return the result.
        ...
    }
...
}
```

The `VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope` method would do something like the following:

- Verify that there's a claim named `http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/scope` or `scp`.
- Verify that the claim has a value that contains the scope expected by the API.

```CSharp
    /// <summary>
    /// When applied to a <see cref="HttpContext"/>, verifies that the user authenticated in the 
    /// web API has any of the accepted scopes.
    /// If the authenticated user doesn't have any of these <paramref name="acceptedScopes"/>, the
    /// method throws an HTTP Unauthorized error with a message noting which scopes are expected in the token.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="acceptedScopes">Scopes accepted by this API</param>
    /// <exception cref="HttpRequestException"/> with a <see cref="HttpResponse.StatusCode"/> set to 
    /// <see cref="HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized"/>
    public static void VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope(this HttpContext context,
                                                     params string[] acceptedScopes)
    {
        if (acceptedScopes == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(acceptedScopes));
        }
        Claim scopeClaim = HttpContext?.User
                                      ?.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/scope");
        if (scopeClaim == null || !scopeClaim.Value.Split(' ').Intersect(acceptedScopes).Any())
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized;
            string message = $"The 'scope' claim does not contain scopes '{string.Join(",", acceptedScopes)}' or was not found";
            throw new HttpRequestException(message);
        }
    }
```

This [sample code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2/blob/02352945c1c4abb895f0b700053506dcde7ed04a/Microsoft.Identity.Web/Resource/ScopesRequiredByWebAPIExtension.cs#L47) is for ASP.NET Core. For ASP.NET, just replace `HttpContext.User` with `ClaimsPrincipal.Current`, and replace the claim type `"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/scope"` with `"scp"`. (See also the code snippet later in this article.)

## Verifying app roles in APIs called by daemon apps

If your web API is called by a [daemon app](scenario-daemon-overview.md), that app should require an application permission to your web API. We've seen in [Exposing application permissions (app roles)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-protected-web-api-app-registration#exposing-application-permissions-app-roles) that your API exposes such permissions (for example, the `access_as_application` app role).
You now need to have your APIs verify that the token it received contains the `roles` claim and
that this claim has the value it expects. The code doing this verification is similar to the code that verifies delegated permissions, except that, instead of testing for `scopes`, your controller action will test for `roles`:

```CSharp
[Authorize]
public class TodoListController : ApiController
{
    public IEnumerable<TodoItem> Get()
    {
        ValidateAppRole("access_as_application");
        ...
    }
```

The `ValidateAppRole()` method can be something like this:

```CSharp
private void ValidateAppRole(string appRole)
{
    //
    // The `role` claim tells you what permissions the client application has in the service.
    // In this case, we look for a `role` value of `access_as_application`.
    //
    Claim roleClaim = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("roles");
    if (roleClaim == null || !roleClaim.Value.Split(' ').Contains(appRole))
    {
        throw new HttpResponseException(new HttpResponseMessage 
        { StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized, 
            ReasonPhrase = $"The 'roles' claim does not contain '{appRole}' or was not found" 
        });
    }
}
}
```

This time, the code snippet is for ASP.NET. For ASP.NET Core, just replace `ClaimsPrincipal.Current` with `HttpContext.User`, and replace the `"roles"` claim name with `"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/roles"`. (See also the code snippet earlier in this article.)

### Accepting app-only tokens if the web API should be called only by daemon apps

The `roles` claim is also used for users in user assignment patterns. (See [How to: Add app roles in your application and receive them in the token](howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md).) So just checking roles will allow apps to sign in as users and the other way around, if the roles are assignable to both. We recommend that you declare different roles for users and apps to prevent this confusion.

If you want to allow only daemon apps to call your web API, add a condition, when you validate the app role, that the token is an app-only token:

```CSharp
string oid = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("oid")?.Value;
string sub = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("sub")?.Value;
bool isAppOnlyToken = oid == sub;
```

Checking the inverse condition will allow only apps that sign in a user to call your API.
