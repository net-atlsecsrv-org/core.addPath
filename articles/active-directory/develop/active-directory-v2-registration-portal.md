# App registration reference

This document provides context and descriptions of various features found in the [App registrations](https://aka.ms/appregistrations) experience in the Azure portal.

## My Applications or Converged applications

This list contains all of your applications registered for use with the Microsoft identity platform (v2.0) endpoint. These applications have the ability to sign in users with both personal Microsoft accounts and work/school accounts from Azure Active Directory. To learn more about the identity platform endpoint, see the [v2.0 overview](active-directory-appmodel-v2-overview.md). These applications can also be used to integrate with the Microsoft account authentication endpoint, `https://login.live.com`.

## Azure AD only applications

This list contains all of your applications registered for use with the Azure AD v1.0 endpoint. These applications only have the ability to sign in users with work/school accounts from Azure Active Directory. This list includes applications that were registered using the **App registrations** experience in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Live SDK Applications

This list contains all of your applications registered for use solely with Microsoft account. They are not enabled for use with Azure Active Directory. This is where you find any applications that were previously registered with the MSA developer portal at `https://account.live.com/developers/applications`. All functions that you previously performed at `https://account.live.com/developers/applications` can now be performed in [App registrations](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).

## Application Secrets

Application secrets are credentials that allow your application to perform reliable [client authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3) with Microsoft identity platform. In OAuth & OpenID Connect, an application secret is commonly referred to as a `client_secret`. In the v2.0 protocol, any application that receives a security token at a web addressable location (using an `https` scheme) must use an application secret to identify itself to Microsoft identity platform upon redemption of that security token. Furthermore, any native client that receives tokens on a device will be forbidden from using an application secret to perform client authentication. This discourages the storage of secrets in insecure environments.

Each app can contain two valid application secrets at any given time. By maintaining two secrets, you have the ability to perform periodic key rollover across your application's entire environment. Once you've migrated the entirety of your application to a new secret, you may delete the old secret and provision a new one.

At this time, only two types of application secrets are allowed in the app registration portal. Choosing **Generate New Password** generates and stores a shared secret in the respective data store, which you can use in your application. Choosing **Generate New Key Pair** creates a new public/private key pair that can be downloaded and used for client authentication to Microsoft identity platform. Choosing **Upload Public Key** allows you to use your own public/private key pair.
You are required to upload a certificate that contains a public key.

## Profile

The profile section of the app registration portal can be used to customize the sign-in page for your application. At this time you can alter the sign-in page's application logo, terms of service URL, and privacy statement URL. The logo must be a transparent 48 x 48 or 50 x 50 pixel image in a GIF, PNG or JPEG file that is 15 KB or smaller. Try changing the values and viewing the resulting sign-in page!

## Live SDK Support

When you enable "Live SDK Support", any application secrets you create will be provisioned into both the Azure AD and Microsoft Account data stores. This allows your application to integrate directly with the Microsoft Account service (login.live.com). If you wish to build an app using Microsoft Account directly (as opposed to using the v2.0 endpoint), you should make sure Live SDK Support is enabled.

Disabling Live SDK support ensures that the application secret is only written into the Azure AD data store. The Azure AD data store incorporates enterprise-grade regulations that allow it to meet certain standards, such as FISMA compliance. If you enable Live SDK support, your application may not achieve compliance with some of these standards.

If you only ever plan to use the v2.0 endpoint, you can safely disable Live SDK support.
