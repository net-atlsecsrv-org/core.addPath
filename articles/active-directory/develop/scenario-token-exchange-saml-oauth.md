# Microsoft identity platform token exchange scenarios with SAML and OIDC/OAuth

SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) / OAuth are popular protocols used to implement Single Sign-On (SSO). Some apps might only implement SAML and others might only implement OIDC/OAuth. Both protocols use tokens to communicate secrets. To learn more about SAML, see [Single Sign-On SAML protocol](single-sign-on-saml-protocol.md). To learn more about OIDC/OAuth, see [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols on Microsoft identity platform](active-directory-v2-protocols.md).

This article outlines a common scenario where an app implements SAML but you need to call into the Graph API, which uses OIDC/OAuth. Basic guidance is provided for people working with this scenario.

## Scenario: You have a SAML token and want to call the Graph API
Many apps are implemented with SAML. However, the Graph API uses the OIDC/OAuth protocols. It's possible, though not trivial, to add OIDC/OAuth functionality to a SAML app. Once OAuth functionality is available in an app, the Graph API can be used.

The general strategy is to add the OIDC/OAuth stack to your app. With your app that implements both standards you can use a session cookie. You aren't exchanging a token explicitly. You're logging a user in with SAML, which generates a session cookie. When the Graph API invokes an OAuth flow, you use the session cookie to authenticate. This strategy assumes the Conditional Access checks pass and the user is authorized.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended library for adding OIDC/OAuth behavior is the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). To learn more about MSAL, see [Overview of Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](msal-overview.md). The previous library was called Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL), however it is not recommended as MSAL is replacing it.
