# Daemon app that calls web APIs - move to production

Now that you know how to acquire and use a token for a service-to-service call, learn how to move your app to production.

## Deployment - case of multi-tenant daemon apps

If you're an ISV creating a daemon application that can run in several tenants, you'll need to make sure that the tenant admins:

- Provisions a service principal for the application
- Grants consent to the application

You'll need to explain to your customers how to perform these operations. For more info, see [Requesting consent for an entire tenant](v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-consent-for-an-entire-tenant).

## Next steps

Here are a few links to learn more:

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

- If you have not already, try the quickstart [Acquire a token and call Microsoft Graph API from a console app using app's identity](./quickstart-v2-netcore-daemon.md).
- Reference documentation for:
  - Instantiating [ConfidentialClientApplication](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.confidentialclientapplicationbuilder)
  - Calling [AcquireTokenForClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.acquiretokenforclientparameterbuilder)
- Other samples/tutorials:
  - [microsoft-identity-platform-console-daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-console-daemon) features a simple .NET Core daemon console application that displays the users of a tenant querying the Microsoft Graph.

    The same sample also illustrates the variation with certificates.

  - [microsoft-identity-platform-aspnet-webapp-daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-identity-platform-aspnet-webapp-daemon) features an ASP.NET MVC web application that syncs data from Microsoft Graph using the identity of the application instead of on behalf of a user. The sample also illustrates the admin consent process.

# [Python](#tab/python)

Try the quickstart [Acquire a token and call Microsoft Graph API from a Python console app using app's identity](./quickstart-v2-python-daemon.md).

# [Java](#tab/java)

MSAL Java is currently in public preview. For more info, see [MSAL Java dev samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/tree/dev/src/samples).
