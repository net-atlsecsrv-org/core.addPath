# Single-page application: Move to production

Now that you know how to acquire a token to call web APIs, here are some things to consider when moving your application to production.

[!INCLUDE [Common steps to move to production](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-scenarios-production.md)]

## Deploy your app

Check out a [deployment sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-aspnet-webapi-multitenant/tree/master/Chapter3) for learning how to deploy your SPA and Web API projects with Azure Storage and Azure App Services, respectively. 

## Code samples

These code samples demonstrate several key operations for a single-page app.
