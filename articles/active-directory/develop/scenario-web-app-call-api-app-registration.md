# A web app that calls web APIs: App registration

A web app that calls web APIs has the same registration as a web app that signs users in. So, follow the instructions in [A web app that signs in users: App registration](scenario-web-app-sign-user-app-registration.md).

However, because the web app now also calls web APIs, it becomes a confidential client application. That's why some extra registration is required. The app must share client credentials, or *secrets*, with the Microsoft identity platform.

[!INCLUDE [Registration of client secrets](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-scenarios-registration-client-secrets.md)]

## API permissions

Web apps call APIs on behalf of the signed-in user. To do that, they must request *delegated permissions*. For details, see [Add permissions to access your web API](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-permissions-to-access-your-web-api).
