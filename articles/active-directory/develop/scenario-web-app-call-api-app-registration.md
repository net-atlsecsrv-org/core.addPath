# Web app that calls web APIs - app registration

A Web app calling web APIs has the same registration as a Web App signing-in users. You'll therefore need to follow the instructions in [Web app that signs-in users - app registration](scenario-web-app-sign-user-app-registration.md)

However since the Web App now calls web APIs, it becomes a confidential client application. That's why there is a bit of extra registration required: it needs to share secrets (client credentials) with the Microsoft identity platform.

## API permissions

Web applications call APIs on behalf of the signed-in user. They need to request delegated permissions. For details see [Add permissions to access web APIs](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis)
