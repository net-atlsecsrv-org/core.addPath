# Add sign-in to Microsoft to an ASP.NET web app

This guide demonstrates how to implement sign-in to Microsoft through an ASP.NET MVC solution by using a traditional web browser-based application and OpenID Connect.

When you've completed this guide, your application will be able to accept sign-ins of personal accounts from the likes of outlook.com and live.com. Additionally, work and school accounts from any company or organization that's integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) will be able to sign in to your app.

> This guide requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.  Don’t have it?  [Download Visual Studio 2019 for free](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

## How the sample app generated by this guide works

![Shows how the sample app generated by this tutorial works](media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-aspnetwebapp-intro/aspnetbrowsergeneral.svg)

The sample application you create is based on a scenario where you use the browser to access an ASP.NET website that prompts a user to authenticate through a sign-in button. In this scenario, most of the work to render the web page occurs on the server side.

## Libraries

This guide uses the following libraries:

|Library|Description|
|---|---|
|[Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect/)|Middleware that enables an application to use OpenIdConnect for authentication|
|[Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies)|Middleware that enables an application to maintain a user session by using cookies|
|[Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb)|Middleware that enables OWIN-based applications to run on Internet Information Services (IIS) by using the ASP.NET request pipeline|

## Set up your project

This section describes how to install and configure the authentication pipeline through OWIN middleware on an ASP.NET project by using OpenID Connect.

> Prefer to download this sample's Visual Studio project instead? [Download a project](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet/archive/master.zip) and skip to the [Register your application](#register-your-application) to configure the code sample before executing.

### Create your ASP.NET project

1. In Visual Studio: Go to **File** > **New** > **Project**.
2. Under **Visual C#\Web**, select **ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)**.
3. Name your application and select **OK**.
4. Select **Empty**, and then select the check box to add **MVC** references.

## Add authentication components

1. In Visual Studio: Go to **Tools** > **Nuget Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
2. Add *OWIN middleware NuGet packages* by typing the following in the Package Manager Console window:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect
    Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies
    Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb
    ```

<!--start-collapse-->
> ### About these libraries
> These libraries enable single sign-on (SSO) by using OpenID Connect through cookie-based authentication. After authentication is completed and the token representing the user is sent to your application, OWIN middleware creates a session cookie. The browser then uses this cookie on subsequent requests so that the user doesn't have to retype the password, and no additional verification is needed.
<!--end-collapse-->

## Configure the authentication pipeline

The following steps are used to create an OWIN middleware Startup class to configure OpenID Connect authentication. This class is executed automatically when your IIS process starts.

> [!TIP]
> If your project doesn't have a `Startup.cs` file in the root folder:
> 1. Right-click the project's root folder, and then select **Add** > **New Item** > **OWIN Startup class**.<br/>
> 2. Name it **Startup.cs**.
>
>> Make sure the class selected is an OWIN Startup class and not a standard C# class. Confirm this by verifying that you see [assembly: OwinStartup(typeof({NameSpace}.Startup))] above the namespace.

1. Add *OWIN* and *Microsoft.IdentityModel* references to Startup.cs:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Owin;
    using Owin;
    using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect;
    using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Notifications;
    ```

2. Replace Startup class with the following code:

    ```csharp
    public class Startup
    {
        // The Client ID is used by the application to uniquely identify itself to Azure AD.
        string clientId = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ClientId"];

        // RedirectUri is the URL where the user will be redirected to after they sign in.
        string redirectUri = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["RedirectUri"];

        // Tenant is the tenant ID (e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com, or 'common' for multi-tenant)
        static string tenant = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Tenant"];

        // Authority is the URL for authority, composed by Azure Active Directory v2.0 endpoint and the tenant name (e.g. https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0)
        string authority = String.Format(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Authority"], tenant);

        /// <summary>
        /// Configure OWIN to use OpenIdConnect 
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="app"></param>
        public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
        {
            app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

            app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());
            app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
                new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
                {
                    // Sets the ClientId, authority, RedirectUri as obtained from web.config
                    ClientId = clientId,
                    Authority = authority,
                    RedirectUri = redirectUri,
                    // PostLogoutRedirectUri is the page that users will be redirected to after sign-out. In this case, it is using the home page
                    PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
                    Scope = OpenIdConnectScope.OpenIdProfile,
                    // ResponseType is set to request the id_token - which contains basic information about the signed-in user
                    ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.IdToken,
                    // ValidateIssuer set to false to allow personal and work accounts from any organization to sign in to your application
                    // To only allow users from a single organizations, set ValidateIssuer to true and 'tenant' setting in web.config to the tenant name
                    // To allow users from only a list of specific organizations, set ValidateIssuer to true and use ValidIssuers parameter
                    TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters()
                    {
                        ValidateIssuer = false // This is a simplification
                    },
                    // OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications configures OWIN to send notification of failed authentications to OnAuthenticationFailed method
                    Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
                    {
                        AuthenticationFailed = OnAuthenticationFailed
                    }
                }
            );
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Handle failed authentication requests by redirecting the user to the home page with an error in the query string
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="context"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        private Task OnAuthenticationFailed(AuthenticationFailedNotification<OpenIdConnectMessage, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions> context)
        {
            context.HandleResponse();
            context.Response.Redirect("/?errormessage=" + context.Exception.Message);
            return Task.FromResult(0);
        }
    }
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting `ValidateIssuer = false` is a simplification for this quickstart. In real applications, you must validate the issuer.
> See the samples to learn how to do that.

<!--start-collapse-->
> ### More information
> The parameters you provide in *OpenIDConnectAuthenticationOptions* serve as coordinates for the application to communicate with Azure AD. Because the OpenID Connect middleware uses cookies in the background, you must also set up cookie authentication as the preceding code shows. The *ValidateIssuer* value tells OpenIdConnect not to restrict access to one specific organization.
<!--end-collapse-->

## Add a controller to handle sign-in and sign-out requests

To create a new controller to expose sign-in and sign-out methods, follow these steps:

1.	Right-click the **Controllers** folder and select **Add** > **Controller**.
2.	Select **MVC (.NET version) Controller – Empty**.
3.	Select **Add**.
4.	Name it **HomeController** and then select **Add**.
5.	Add OWIN references to the class:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies;
    using Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect;
    ```

6. Add the following two methods to handle sign-in and sign-out to your controller by initiating an authentication challenge:

    ```csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// Send an OpenID Connect sign-in request.
    /// Alternatively, you can just decorate the SignIn method with the [Authorize] attribute
    /// </summary>
    public void SignIn()
    {
        if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
                new AuthenticationProperties{ RedirectUri = "/" },
                OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
        }
    }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Send an OpenID Connect sign-out request.
    /// </summary>
    public void SignOut()
    {
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
                OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType,
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
    }
    ```

## Create the app's home page for user sign-in

In Visual Studio, create a new view to add the sign-in button and to display user information after authentication:

1.	Right-click the **Views\Home** folder and select **Add View**.
2.	Name the new view **Index**.
3.	Add the following HTML, which includes the sign-in button, to the file:

    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Sign in with Microsoft Guide</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    @if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <!-- If the user is not authenticated, display the sign-in button -->
        <a href="@Url.Action("SignIn", "Home")" style="text-decoration: none;">
            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xml:space="preserve" width="300px" height="50px" viewBox="0 0 3278 522" class="SignInButton">
            <style type="text/css">.fil0:hover {fill: #4B4B4B;} .fnt0 {font-size: 260px;font-family: 'Segoe UI Semibold', 'Segoe UI'; text-decoration: none;}</style>
            <rect class="fil0" x="2" y="2" width="3174" height="517" fill="black" />
            <rect x="150" y="129" width="122" height="122" fill="#F35325" />
            <rect x="284" y="129" width="122" height="122" fill="#81BC06" />
            <rect x="150" y="263" width="122" height="122" fill="#05A6F0" />
            <rect x="284" y="263" width="122" height="122" fill="#FFBA08" />
            <text x="470" y="357" fill="white" class="fnt0">Sign in with Microsoft</text>
            </svg>
        </a>
    }
    else
    {
        <span><br/>Hello @System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("name").Value;</span>
        <br /><br />
        @Html.ActionLink("See Your Claims", "Index", "Claims")
        <br /><br />
        @Html.ActionLink("Sign out", "SignOut", "Home")
    }
    @if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Request.QueryString["errormessage"]))
    {
        <div style="background-color:red;color:white;font-weight: bold;">Error: @Request.QueryString["errormessage"]</div>
    }
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

<!--end-collapse-->

## Add a controller to display user's claims
This controller demonstrates the uses of the `[Authorize]` attribute to protect a controller. This attribute restricts access to the controller by allowing only authenticated users. The following code makes use of the attribute to display user claims that were retrieved as part of sign-in:

1.	Right-click the **Controllers** folder, and then select **Add** > **Controller**.
2.	Select **MVC {version} Controller – Empty**.
3.	Select **Add**.
4.	Name it **ClaimsController**.
5.	Replace the code of your controller class with the following code. This adds the `[Authorize]` attribute to the class:

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    public class ClaimsController : Controller
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Add user's claims to viewbag
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            var userClaims = User.Identity as System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity;
    
            //You get the user’s first and last name below:
            ViewBag.Name = userClaims?.FindFirst("name")?.Value;
    
            // The 'preferred_username' claim can be used for showing the username
            ViewBag.Username = userClaims?.FindFirst("preferred_username")?.Value;
    
            // The subject/ NameIdentifier claim can be used to uniquely identify the user across the web
            ViewBag.Subject = userClaims?.FindFirst(System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
    
            // TenantId is the unique Tenant Id - which represents an organization in Azure AD
            ViewBag.TenantId = userClaims?.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid")?.Value;
    
            return View();
        }
    }
    ```

<!--start-collapse-->
> ### More information
> Because of the use of the `[Authorize]` attribute, all methods of this controller can be executed only if the user is authenticated. If the user isn't authenticated and tries to access the controller, OWIN initiates an authentication challenge and forces the user to authenticate. The preceding code looks at the list of claims for specific user attributes included in the user’s Id token. These attributes include the user’s full name and username, as well as the global user identifier subject. It also contains the *Tenant ID*, which represents the ID for the user’s organization. 
<!--end-collapse-->

## Create a view to display the user's claims

In Visual Studio, create a new view to display the user's claims in a web page:

1.	Right-click the **Views\Claims** folder, and then select **Add View**.
2.	Name the new view **Index**.
3.	Add the following HTML to the file:

    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Sign in with Microsoft Sample</title>
        <link href="@Url.Content("~/Content/bootstrap.min.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    </head>
    <body style="padding:50px">
        <h3>Main Claims:</h3>
        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">
            <tr><td>Name</td><td>@ViewBag.Name</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Username</td><td>@ViewBag.Username</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Subject</td><td>@ViewBag.Subject</td></tr>
            <tr><td>TenantId</td><td>@ViewBag.TenantId</td></tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <h3>All Claims:</h3>
        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
        @foreach (var claim in System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Claims)
        {
            <tr><td>@claim.Type</td><td>@claim.Value</td></tr>
        }
        </table>
        <br />
        <br />
        @Html.ActionLink("Sign out", "SignOut", "Home", null, new { @class = "btn btn-primary" })
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Register your application

To register your application and add your application registration information to your solution, you have two options:

### Option 1: Express mode

To quickly register your application, follow these steps:

1. Go to the new  [Azure portal - App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/applicationsListBlade/quickStartType/AspNetWebAppQuickstartPage/sourceType/docs) pane.
1. Enter a name for your application and select **Register**.
1. Follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application in a single click.

### Option 2: Advanced mode

To register your application and add the app's registration information to your solution manually, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio, and then:
   1. in Solution Explorer, select the project and view the Properties window (if you don’t see a Properties window, press F4).
   1. Change SSL Enabled to `True`.
   1. Right-click the project in Visual Studio, select **Properties**, and then select the **Web** tab. In the **Servers** section, change the **Project Url** setting to the **SSL URL**.
   1. Copy the SSL URL. You'll add this URL to the list of Redirect URLs in the Registration portal’s list of Redirect URLs in the next step.<br/><br/>![Project properties](media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-aspnetwebapp-configure/vsprojectproperties.png)<br />
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using a work or school account, or by using a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the upper-right corner, and set your portal session to the Azure AD tenant that you want.
1. Go to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter your application's registration information:
   1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, like **ASPNET-Tutorial**.
   1. Add the SSL URL you copied from Visual Studio in step 1 (for example, `https://localhost:44368/`) in **Reply URL**, and select **Register**.
1. Select the **Authentication** menu, select **ID tokens** under **Implicit Grant**, and then select **Save**.
1. Add the following in the web.config file, located in the root folder in the `configuration\appSettings` section:

    ```xml
    <add key="ClientId" value="Enter_the_Application_Id_here" />
    <add key="redirectUri" value="Enter_the_Redirect_URL_here" />
    <add key="Tenant" value="common" />
    <add key="Authority" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/v2.0" />
    ```

1. Replace `ClientId` with the Application ID you just registered.
1. Replace `redirectUri` with the SSL URL of your project.

## Test your code

To test your application in Visual Studio, press F5 to run your project. The browser opens to the http://<span></span>localhost:{port} location, and you see the **Sign in with Microsoft** button. Select the button to start the sign-in process.

When you're ready to run your test, use an Azure AD account (work or school account) or a personal Microsoft account (<span>live.</span>com or <span>outlook.</span>com) to sign in.

<!--start-collapse-->
> ###  Permissions and consent in the Microsoft identity platform endpoint
>  Applications that integrate with Microsoft identity platform follow an authorization model that gives users and administrators control over how data can be accessed. After a user authenticates with Azure AD to access this application, they will be prompted to consent to the permissions requested by the application ("View your basic profile" and "Maintain access to data you have given it access to"). After accepting these permissions, the user will continue on to the application results. However, the user may instead be prompted with a **Need admin consent** page if either of the following occur:
>  > - The application developer adds any additional permissions that require **Admin consent**.
>  > - Or the tenant is configured (in **Enterprise Applications -> User Settings**) where users cannot consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf.
>
> For more information, refer to [Permissions and consent in the Microsoft identity platform endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent).
<!--end-collapse-->

#### View application results

After you sign in, the user is redirected to the home page of your website. The home page is the HTTPS URL that's specified in your application registration info in the Microsoft Application Registration Portal. The home page includes a *"Hello \<user>"* welcome message, a link to sign out, and a link to view the user’s claims. The link for the user's claims connects to the Claims controller that you created earlier.

### View the user's claims

To view the user's claims, select the link to browse to the controller view that's available only to authenticated users.

#### View the claims results

After you browse to the controller view, you should see a table that contains the basic properties for the user:

|Property |Value |Description |
|---|---|---|
|**Name** |User's full name | The user’s first and last name
|**Username** |user<span>@domain.com</span> | The username that's used to identify the user|
|**Subject** |Subject |A string that uniquely identifies the user across the web|
|**Tenant ID** |Guid | A **guid** that uniquely represents the user’s Azure AD organization|

Additionally, you should see a table of all claims that are in the authentication request. For more information, see the [list of claims that are in an Azure AD ID token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims).

### Test access to a method that has an Authorize attribute (optional)

To test access as an anonymous user to a controller that's protected by the `Authorize` attribute, follow these steps:

1. Select the link to sign out the user, and complete the sign-out process.
2. In your browser, type http://<span></span>localhost:{port}/claims to access your controller that's protected by the `Authorize` attribute.

#### Expected results after access to a protected controller

You're prompted to authenticate to use the protected controller view.

## Advanced options

<!--start-collapse-->
### Protect your entire website
To protect your entire website, in the **Global.asax** file, add the `AuthorizeAttribute` attribute to the `GlobalFilters` filter in the `Application_Start` method:

```csharp
GlobalFilters.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeAttribute());
```
<!--end-collapse-->

### Restrict who can sign in to your application

By default when you build the application created by this guide, your application will accept sign-ins of personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that's integrated with Azure AD. This is a recommended option for SaaS applications.

To restrict user sign-in access for your application, multiple options are available.

#### Option 1: Restrict users from only one organization's Active Directory instance to sign in to your application (single-tenant)

This option is frequently used for *LOB applications*: If you want your application to accept sign-ins only from accounts that belong to a specific Azure AD instance (including *guest accounts* of that instance), follow these steps:

1. In the web.config file, change the value for the `Tenant` parameter from `Common` to the tenant name of the organization, such as `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.
2. In your [OWIN Startup class](#configure-the-authentication-pipeline), set the `ValidateIssuer` argument to `true`.

#### Option 2: Restrict access to users in a specific list of organizations

You can restrict sign-in access to only those user accounts that are in an Azure AD organization that's on the list of allowed organizations:
1. In your [OWIN Startup class](#configure-the-authentication-pipeline), set the `ValidateIssuer` argument to `true`.
2. Set the value of the `ValidIssuers` parameter to the list of allowed organizations.

#### Option 3: Use a custom method to validate issuers

You can implement a custom method to validate issuers by using the **IssuerValidator** parameter. For more information about how to use this parameter, see [TokenValidationParameters class](/previous-versions/visualstudio/dn464192(v=vs.114)).
