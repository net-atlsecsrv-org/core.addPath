# Prepare mobile apps for production

This article provides details about how to improve the quality and reliability of your mobile app before you move it to production.

## Handle errors

As you prepare a mobile app for production, several error conditions can occur. The main cases you'll handle are silent failures and fallbacks to interaction. Other conditions that you should consider include no-network situations, service outages, requirements for admin consent, and other scenario-specific cases.

For each Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) type, you can find sample code and wiki content that describes how to handle error conditions:

- [MSAL Android wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android)
- [MSAL iOS wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc/wiki)
- [MSAL.NET wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki)
