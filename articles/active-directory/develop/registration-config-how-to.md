# How to configure endpoints

You can find the authentication endpoints for your application in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

-   From the left navigation pane, click **Azure Active Directory**.

-   Click **App Registrations** and choose **Endpoints**.

-   This open up the **Endpoints** page, which list all the authentication endpoints for your tenant.
