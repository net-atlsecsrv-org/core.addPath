# Xamarin Android-specific considerations with MSAL.NET
This article discusses specific considerations when using the system browser on Xamarin Android with the Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET).

Starting with MSAL.NET 2.4.0-preview, MSAL.NET supports browsers other than Chrome and no longer requires Chrome be installed on the Android device for authentication.

We recommend you use browsers that support custom tabs, such as these:

| Browsers with custom tabs support | Package Name |
|------| ------- |
|Chrome | com.android.chrome|
|Microsoft Edge | com.microsoft.emmx|
|Firefox | org.mozilla.firefox|
|Ecosia | com.ecosia.android|
|Kiwi | com.kiwibrowser.browser|
|Brave | com.brave.browser|

In addition to browsers with custom tabs support, based on our testing, a few browsers that don't support custom tabs will also work for authentication: Opera, Opera Mini, InBrowser, and Maxthon. For more information, read [table for test results](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Android-system-browser#devices-and-browsers-tested).

## Known issues

- If the user has no browser enabled on the device, MSAL.NET will throw an `AndroidActivityNotFound` Exception. 
  - **Mitigation**: Inform the user that they should enable a browser (preferably one with custom tabs support) on their device.

- If authentication fails (ex. authentication launches with DuckDuckGo), MSAL.NET will return an `AuthenticationCanceled MsalClientException`. 
  - **Root Problem**: A browser with custom tabs support was not enabled on the device. Authentication launched with an alternate browser, which wasn't able to complete authentication. 
  - **Mitigation**: Inform the user that they should install a browser (preferably one with custom tab support) on their device.

## Devices and browsers tested
