# Scenario: A web API that calls web APIs

Learn what you need to know to build a web API that calls web APIs.

## Prerequisites

This scenario, in which a protected web API calls other web APIs, builds on [Scenario: Protected web API](scenario-protected-web-api-overview.md).

## Overview

- A web, desktop, mobile, or single-page application client (not represented in the accompanying diagram) calls a protected web API and provides a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token in its "Authorization" HTTP header.
- The protected web API validates the token and uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) `AcquireTokenOnBehalfOf` method to request another token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) so that the protected web API can call a second web API, or downstream web API, on behalf of the user.
- The protected web API can also call `AcquireTokenSilent`later to request tokens for other downstream APIs on behalf of the same user. `AcquireTokenSilent` refreshes the token when needed.

## Specifics

The app registration part that's related to API permissions is classical. The app configuration involves using the OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow to exchange the JWT bearer token against a token for a downstream API. This token is added to the token cache, where it's available in the web API's controllers, and it can then acquire a token silently to call downstream APIs.
