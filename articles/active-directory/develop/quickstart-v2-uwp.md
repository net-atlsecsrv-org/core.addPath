> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal" id="autoupdate" class="nextstepaction"]
> [Download the code sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-uwp-v2/archive/msal3x.zip)

> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal"]
> #### Step 3: Your app is configured and ready to run
> We have configured your project with values of your app's properties and it's ready to run.

> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal"]
> > [!NOTE]
> > `Enter_the_Supported_Account_Info_Here`

> [!div renderon="docs"]
> #### Step 3: Configure the Visual Studio project
>
> 1. Extract the .zip archive to a local folder close to the root of your drive. For example, into **C:\Azure-Samples**.
> 1. Open the project in Visual Studio. Install the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload and any individual SDK components if prompted.
> 1. In *MainPage.Xaml.cs*, change the value of the `ClientId` variable to the **Application (Client) ID** of the application you registered earlier.
>
>    ```csharp
>    private const string ClientId = "Enter_the_Application_Id_here";
>    ```
>
>    You can find the **Application (client) ID** on the app's **Overview** pane in the Azure portal (**Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > *{Your app registration}*).
> 1. Create and then select a new self-signed test certificate for the package:
>     1. In the **Solution Explorer**, double-click the *Package.appxmanifest* file.
>     1. Select **Packaging** > **Choose Certificate...** > **Create...**.
>     1. Enter a password and then select **OK**.
>     1. Select **Select from file...**, and then select the *Native_UWP_V2_TemporaryKey.pfx* file you just created, and select **OK**.
>     1. Close the *Package.appxmanifest* file (select **OK** if prompted to save the file).
>     1. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Native_UWP_V2** project and select **Properties**.
>     1. Select **Signing**, and then select the .pfx you created in the **Choose a strong name key file** drop-down.

#### Step 4: Run the application

To run the sample application on your local machine:

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, choose the right platform (probably **x64** or **x86**, not ARM). The target device should change from *Device* to *Local Machine*.
1. Select **Debug** > **Start Without Debugging**.
    
    If you're prompted to do so, you might first need to enable **Developer Mode**, and then **Start Without Debugging** again to launch the app.

When the app's window appears, you can select the **Call Microsoft Graph API** button, enter your credentials, and consent to the permissions requested by the application. If successful, the application displays some token information and data obtained from the call to the Microsoft Graph API.

## How the sample works

![Shows how the sample app generated by this quickstart works](media/quickstart-v2-uwp/uwp-intro.svg)

### MSAL.NET

MSAL ([Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client)) is the library used to sign in users and request security tokens. The security tokens are used to access an API protected by Microsoft Identity platform for developers. You can install MSAL by running the following command in Visual Studio's *Package Manager Console*:

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Identity.Client
```

### MSAL initialization

You can add the reference for MSAL by adding the following code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
```

Then, MSAL is initialized using the following code:

```csharp
public static IPublicClientApplication PublicClientApp;
PublicClientApp = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(ClientId)
                                                .WithRedirectUri("https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient")
                                                    .Build();
```

The value of `ClientId` is the **Application (client) ID** of the app you registered in the Azure portal. You can find this value in the app's **Overview** page in the Azure portal.

### Requesting tokens

MSAL has two methods for acquiring tokens in a UWP app: `AcquireTokenInteractive` and `AcquireTokenSilent`.

#### Get a user token interactively

Some situations require forcing users to interact with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint through a popup window to either validate their credentials or to give consent. Some examples include:

- The first-time users sign in to the application
- When users may need to reenter their credentials because the password has expired
- When your application is requesting access to a resource, that the user needs to consent to
- When two factor authentication is required

```csharp
authResult = await App.PublicClientApp.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                      .ExecuteAsync();
```

The `scopes` parameter contains the scopes being requested, such as `{ "user.read" }` for Microsoft Graph or `{ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" }` for custom web APIs.

#### Get a user token silently

Use the `AcquireTokenSilent` method to obtain tokens to access protected resources after the initial `AcquireTokenInteractive` method. You donâ€™t want to require the user to validate their credentials every time they need to access a resource. Most of the time you want token acquisitions and renewal without any user interaction

```csharp
var accounts = await App.PublicClientApp.GetAccountsAsync();
var firstAccount = accounts.FirstOrDefault();
authResult = await App.PublicClientApp.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, firstAccount)
                                      .ExecuteAsync();
```

* `scopes` contains the scopes being requested, such as `{ "user.read" }` for Microsoft Graph or `{ "api://<Application ID>/access_as_user" }` for custom web APIs.
* `firstAccount` specifies the first user account in the cache (MSAL supports multiple users in a single app).
