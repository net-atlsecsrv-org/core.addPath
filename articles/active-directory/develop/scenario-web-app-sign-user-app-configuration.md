# Web app that signs-in users - code configuration

Learn how to configure the code for your Web app that signs-in users.

## Libraries used to protect Web Apps

<!-- This section can be in an include for Web App and Web APIs -->
The libraries used to protect a Web App (and a Web API) are:

| Platform | Library | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| ![.NET](media/sample-v2-code/logo_net.png) | [Identity model extensions for .NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/wiki) | Used directly by ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, Microsoft Identity Extensions for .NET proposes a set of DLLs running both on .NET Framework and .NET Core. From an ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core Web app, you can control token validation using the **TokenValidationParameters** class (in particular in some ISV scenarios) |

## Configuration files

Web applications that sign in users with the Microsoft identity platform are usually configured through configuration files. The settings that you need to fill in are:

- the cloud `Instance` if you want your app to run (for instance in national clouds)
- the audience in `tenantId`
- the `clientId` for your application, as copied from the Azure portal.

Sometimes, applications can be parametrized by the `authority`, which is the concatenation of the `instance` and the `tenantId`

# [ASP.NET Core](#tab/aspnetcore)

In ASP.NET Core, these settings are located in the [appsettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/bc564d68179c36546770bf4d6264ce72009bc65a/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg/appsettings.json#L2-L8) file, in the "AzureAD" section.

```Json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    // Azure Cloud instance among:
    // "https://login.microsoftonline.com/" for Azure Public cloud.
    // "https://login.microsoftonline.us/" for Azure US government.
    // "https://login.microsoftonline.de/" for Azure AD Germany
    // "https://login.chinacloudapi.cn/" for Azure AD China operated by 21Vianet
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",

    // Azure AD Audience among:
    // - the tenant Id as a GUID obtained from the azure portal to sign-in users in your organization
    // - "organizations" to sign-in users in any work or school accounts
    // - "common" to sign-in users with any work and school account or Microsoft personal account
    // - "consumers" to sign-in users with Microsoft personal account only
    "TenantId": "[Enter the tenantId here]]",

    // Client Id (Application ID) obtained from the Azure portal
    "ClientId": "[Enter the Client Id]",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
  }
}
```

In ASP.NET Core, there's another file [properties\launchSettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/bc564d68179c36546770bf4d6264ce72009bc65a/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg/Properties/launchSettings.json#L6-L7) that contains the URL (`applicationUrl`) and the SSL Port (`sslPort`) for your application and various profiles.

```Json
{
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": false,
    "anonymousAuthentication": true,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:3110/",
      "sslPort": 44321
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "IIS Express": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "webApp": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:3110/"
    }
  }
}
```

In the Azure portal, the reply URIs that you need to register in the **Authentication** page for your application needs to match these URLs; that is, for the two configuration files above, they would be `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc` as the applicationUrl is `http://localhost:3110` but the `sslPort` is specified (44321), and the `CallbackPath` is `/signin-oidc` as defined in the `appsettings.json`.
  
In the same way, the sign-out URI would be set to `https://localhost:44321/signout-callback-oidc`.

# [ASP.NET](#tab/aspnet)

In ASP.NET, the application is configured through the [Web.Config](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnet-webapp-openidconnect/blob/a2da310539aa613b77da1f9e1c17585311ab22b7/WebApp/Web.config#L12-L15) file lines 12-15

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--
  For more information on how to configure your ASP.NET application, please visit
  https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301880
  -->
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="[Enter your client ID, as obtained from the app registration portal]" />

    <add key="ida:RedirectUri" value="https://localhost:44326/" />
    <add key="vs:EnableBrowserLink" value="false" />
  </appSettings>
```

In the Azure portal, the reply URIs that you need to register in the **Authentication** page for your application needs to match these URLs; that is `https://localhost:44326/`.

# [Java](#tab/java)

In Java, the configuration is located in the [application.properties](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/blob/d55ee4ac0ce2c43378f2c99fd6e6856d41bdf144/src/main/resources/application.properties) file located under `src/main/resources`

```Java
aad.clientId=Enter_the_Application_Id_here
aad.authority=https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here/
aad.secretKey=Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here
aad.redirectUriSignin=http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/secure/aad
aad.redirectUriGraphUsers=http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/graph/users
```

In the Azure portal, the reply URIs that you need to register in the **Authentication** page for your application needs to match the redirectUris defined by the application, that is `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/secure/aad` and `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/graph/users`

# [Python](#tab/python)

Here is the Python configuration file in [app_config.py](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp/blob/0.1.0/app_config.py)

```Python
CLIENT_SECRET = "Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here"
AUTHORITY = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common""
CLIENT_ID = "Enter_the_Application_Id_here"
ENDPOINT = 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users'
SCOPE = ["User.ReadBasic.All"]
SESSION_TYPE = "filesystem"  # So token cache will be stored in server-side session
```

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart proposes to store the client secret in the configuration file for simplicity. 
> In your production app, you'd want to use other ways to store your secret,
> such as KeyVault, or an environment variable as described in Flask's documentation:
> https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/config/#configuring-from-environment-variables
>
> ```python
> CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("CLIENT_SECRET")
> if not CLIENT_SECRET:
>     raise ValueError("Need to define CLIENT_SECRET environment variable")
> ```

## Initialization code

The initialization code is different depending on the platform. For ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET, signing in users is delegated to the OpenIDConnect middleware. Today the ASP.NET / ASP.NET Core template generate web applications for the Azure AD v1.0 endpoint. Therefore, a bit of configuration is required to adapt them to the Microsoft identity platform (v2.0) endpoint. In the case of Java, it's handled by Spring with the cooperation of the application.

# [ASP.NET Core](#tab/aspnetcore)

In ASP.NET Core Web Apps (and Web APIs), the application is protected because you have a `[Authorize]` attribute on the controllers or the controller actions. This attribute checks that the user is authenticated. The code doing the application initialization is located in the `Startup.cs` file, and, to add authentication with the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0), you'll need to add the following code. The comments in the code should be self-explanatory.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you start your project with default ASP.NET core web project within Visual studio or using `dotnet new mvc` the method `AddAzureAD` is available by default because the related packages are automatically loaded.
  > However if you build a project from scratch and are trying to use the below code we suggest you to add the NuGet Package **"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI"** to your project to make the `AddAzureAD` method available.
  
The following code is available from [Startup.cs#L33-L34](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/faa94fd49c2da46b22d6694c4f5c5895795af26d/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg/Startup.cs#L33-L34)

```CSharp
public class Startup
{
 ...

  // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
    ...
      // Sign-in users with the Microsoft identity platform
      services.AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(Configuration);
  
      services.AddMvc(options =>
      {
          var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
              .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
              .Build();
            options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
            })
        .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
    }
```

The `AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication` is an extension method defined in [Microsoft.Identity.Web/WebAppServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L23](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/faa94fd49c2da46b22d6694c4f5c5895795af26d/Microsoft.Identity.Web/WebAppServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L23). It:

- adds the authentication service
- configure options to read the config file
- configures the OpenID connect options so that the used authority is the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0) endpoint
- the issuer of the token is validated
- the claims corresponding to name is mapped from the "preferred_username" claim in the ID Token 

In addition to the configuration, you can specify, when calling `AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication`:

- the name of the configuration section (by default AzureAD)
- if you want to trace the OpenIdConnect middleware events, which can help you troubleshooting your Web application if authentication doesn't work: setting `subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents` to `true` will show you how information gets elaborated by the set of ASP.NET Core middleware as it progresses from the HTTP response to the identity of the user in the `HttpContext.User`.

```CSharp
/// <summary>
/// Add authentication with Microsoft identity platform.
/// This method expects the configuration file will have a section named "AzureAd" with the necessary settings to initialize authentication options.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="services">Service collection to which to add this authentication scheme</param>
/// <param name="configuration">The Configuration object</param>
/// <param name="subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents">
/// Set to true if you want to debug, or just understand the OpenIdConnect events.
/// </param>
/// <returns></returns>
public static IServiceCollection AddMicrosoftIdentityPlatformAuthentication(
  this IServiceCollection services,
  IConfiguration configuration,
  string configSectionName = "AzureAd",
  bool subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents = false)
{
  services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
      .AddAzureAD(options => configuration.Bind(configSectionName, options));
  services.Configure<AzureADOptions>(options => configuration.Bind(configSectionName, options));

  services.Configure<OpenIdConnectOptions>(AzureADDefaults.OpenIdScheme, options =>
  {
      // Per the code below, this application signs in users in any Work and School
      // accounts and any Microsoft Personal Accounts.
      // If you want to direct Azure AD to restrict the users that can sign-in, change
      // the tenant value of the appsettings.json file in the following way:
      // - only Work and School accounts => 'organizations'
      // - only Microsoft Personal accounts => 'consumers'
      // - Work and School and Personal accounts => 'common'
      // If you want to restrict the users that can sign-in to only one tenant
      // set the tenant value in the appsettings.json file to the tenant ID
      // or domain of this organization
      options.Authority = options.Authority + "/v2.0/";

      // If you want to restrict the users that can sign-in to several organizations
      // Set the tenant value in the appsettings.json file to 'organizations', and add the
      // issuers you want to accept to options.TokenValidationParameters.ValidIssuers collection
      options.TokenValidationParameters.IssuerValidator = AadIssuerValidator.GetIssuerValidator(options.Authority).Validate;

      // Set the nameClaimType to be preferred_username.
      // This change is needed because certain token claims from Azure AD V1 endpoint
      // (on which the original .NET core template is based) are different than Microsoft identity platform endpoint.
      // For more details see [ID Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens)
      // and [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens)
      options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "preferred_username";

      // ...

      if (subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents)
      {
          OpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnostics.Subscribe(options.Events);
      }
  });
  return services;
}
  ...
```

The `AadIssuerValidator` class enables that the issuer of the token is validated in many cases (v1.0 or v2.0 token, single-tenant, or multi-tenant application or application that signs in users with their personal Microsoft accounts, in the Azure public cloud, or national clouds). It's available from [Microsoft.Identity.Web/Resource/AadIssuerValidator.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/master/Microsoft.Identity.Web/Resource/AadIssuerValidator.cs)

# [ASP.NET](#tab/aspnet)

The code related to authentication in ASP.NET Web app / Web APIs is located in the [App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnet-webapp-openidconnect/blob/a2da310539aa613b77da1f9e1c17585311ab22b7/WebApp/App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs#L17-L61) file.

```CSharp
 public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
 {
  app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

  app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

  app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
    new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
    {
     // The `Authority` represents the identity platform endpoint - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0
     // The `Scope` describes the initial permissions that your app will need.
     //  See https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-scopes/
     ClientId = clientId,
     Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, "common", "/v2.0"),
     RedirectUri = redirectUri,
     Scope = "openid profile",
     PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
    });
 }
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

The Java sample uses the Spring framework. The application is protected because you implement a `Filter`, which intercepts each HTTP response. In the Java Web app quickstart, this filter is `AuthFilter` in `src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/msalwebsample/AuthFilter.java`. The filter process the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and therefore:

- verifies if the user is authenticated (`isAuthenticated()` method)
- if the user isn't authenticated, it computes the url of the Azure AD authorize endpoints, and redirects the browser to this URI
- when the response arrives, containing the auth code flow it lets's msal4j acquiring the token.
- when it finally receives the token from the token endpoint (on the redirect URI), the user is signed in.

For details see the `doFilter()` method in [AuthFilter.java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/blob/master/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/msalwebsample/AuthFilter.java)

> [!NOTE]
> The code of the `doFilter()` is written in a slightly different order, but the flow is the one described.

See [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md) for details about the authorization code flow, triggered by this method

# [Python](#tab/python)

The Python sample uses Flask. The initialization of flask, and MSAL.Python is done in [app.py#L1-L28](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp/blob/e03be352914bfbd58be0d4170eba1fb7a4951d84/app.py#L1-L28)

```Python
import uuid
import requests
from flask import Flask, render_template, session, request, redirect, url_for
from flask_session import Session  # https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Session
import msal
import app_config


app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(app_config)
Session(app)
```
