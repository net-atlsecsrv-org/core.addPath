# Troubleshoot publisher verification
If you are unable to complete the process or are experiencing unexpected behavior with [publisher verification](publisher-verification-overview.md), you should start by doing the following if you are receiving errors or seeing unexpected behavior: 

1. Review the [requirements](publisher-verification-overview.md#requirements) and ensure they have all been met.

1. Review the instructions to [mark an app as publisher verified](mark-app-as-publisher-verified.md) and ensure all steps have been performed successfully.

1. Review the list of [common issues](#common-issues).

1. Reproduce the request using [Graph Explorer](#making-microsoft-graph-api-calls) to gather additional info and rule out any issues in the UI.

## Common Issues
Below are some common issues that may occur during the process. 

- **I don’t know my Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID) or I don’t know who the primary contact for the account is** 
    1. Navigate to the [MPN enrollment page](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/joinnow/basicpartnernetwork/new)
    1. Sign in with a user account in the org's primary Azure AD tenant 
    1. If an MPN account already exists, this will be recognized and you will be added to the account 
    1. Navigate to the [partner profile page](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/accountsettings/connectedpartnerprofile) where the MPN ID and primary account contact will be listed

- **I don’t know who my Azure AD Global Administrator (also known as Company Admin or Tenant Admin) is, how do I find them? What about the Application Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator?**
    1. Sign in to the [Azure AD Portal](https://aad.portal.azure.com) using a user account in your organization's primary tenant
    1. Navigate to [Role Management](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RolesAndAdministrators)
    1. Click the desired admin role
    1. The list of users assigned that role will be displayed

- **I don't know who the admin(s) for my MPN account are**
    Go to the [MPN User Management page](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/users) and filter the user list to see what users are in various admin roles.

- **I am getting an error saying that my MPN ID is invalid or that I do not have access to it.**
    1. Go to your [partner profile](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/accountsettings/connectedpartnerprofile) and verify that: 
        - The MPN ID is correct. 
        - There are no errors or “pending actions” shown, and the verification status under Legal business profile and Partner info both say “authorized” or “success”.
    1. Go to the [MPN tenant management page](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/tenantmanagement) and confirm that the tenant the app is registered in and that you are signing with a user account from is on the list of associated tenants. If you need to add an additional tenant, follow the instructions [here](/partner-center/multi-tenant-account). Please be aware that all Global Admins of any tenant you add will be granted Global Admin privileges on your Partner Center account.
    1. Go to the [MPN User Management page](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/users) and confirm the user you are signing in as is either a Global Admin, MPN Admin, or Accounts Admin. If you need to add a user to a role in Partner Center, follow the instructions [here](/partner-center/create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions).

- **When I sign into the Azure AD portal, I do not see any apps registered. Why?** 
    Your app registrations may have been created using a different user account in this tenant, a personal/consumer account, or in a different tenant. Ensure you are signed in with the correct account in the tenant where your app registrations were created.

- **I'm getting an error related to multi-factor authentication. What should I do?** 
    Please ensure [multi-factor authentication](../fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-mfa-get-started.md) is enabled and **required** for the user you are signing in with and for this scenario. For example, MFA could be:
    - Always required for the user you are signing in with
    - [Required for Azure management](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-azure-management.md).
    - [Required for the type of administrator](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa.md) you are signing in with.

## Making Microsoft Graph API calls 

If you are having an issue but unable to understand why based on what you are seeing in the UI, it may be helpful to perform further troubleshooting by using Microsoft Graph calls to perform the same operations you can perform in the App Registration portal.

The easiest way to make these requests is using [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). You may also consider other options like using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or using PowerShell to [invoke a web request](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest).  

You can use Microsoft Graph to both set and unset your app’s verified publisher and check the result after performing one of these operations. The result can be seen on both the [application](/graph/api/resources/application) object corresponding to your app registration and any [service principals](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal) that have been instantiated from that app. For more information on the relationship between those objects, see: [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](app-objects-and-service-principals.md).  

Here are examples of some useful requests:  

### Set Verified Publisher 

Request

```
POST /applications/0cd04273-0d11-4e62-9eb3-5c3971a7cbec/setVerifiedPublisher

} 
```
 
Response 
```

    } 
} 
```

## Error Reference 

The following is a list of the potential error codes you may receive, either when troubleshooting with Microsoft Graph or going through the process in the app registration portal.

### MPNAccountNotFoundOrNoAccess	 

The MPN ID you provided (<MPNID>) does not exist, or you do not have access to it. Provide a valid MPN ID and try again.
    
Most commonly caused by the signed-in user not being a member of the proper role for the MPN account in Partner Center- see [requirements](publisher-verification-overview.md#requirements) for a list of eligible roles and see [common issues](#common-issues) for more information. Can also be caused by the tenant the app is registered in not being added to the MPN account, or an invalid MPN ID.

### MPNGlobalAccountNotFound	 

The MPN ID you provided (<MPNID>) is not valid. Provide a valid MPN ID and try again.
    
Most commonly caused when an MPN ID is provided that corresponds to a Partner Location Account (PLA). Only Partner Global Accounts are supported. See [Partner Center account structure](/partner-center/account-structure) for more details.

### MPNAccountInvalid	 

The MPN ID you provided (<MPNID>) is not valid. Provide a valid MPN ID and try again.
    
Most commonly caused by the wrong MPN ID being provided.

### MPNAccountNotVetted	 

The MPN ID (<MPNID>) you provided has not completed the vetting process. Complete this process in Partner Center and try again. 
    
Most commonly caused by when the MPN account has not completed the [verification](/partner-center/verification-responses) process.

### NoPublisherIdOnAssociatedMPNAccount	 

The MPN ID you provided (<MPNID>) is not valid. Provide a valid MPN ID and try again. 
   
Most commonly caused by the wrong MPN ID being provided.

### MPNIdDoesNotMatchAssociatedMPNAccount	 

The MPN ID you provided (<MPNID>) is not valid. Provide a valid MPN ID and try again.
    
Most commonly caused by the wrong MPN ID being provided.

### ApplicationNotFound	 

The target application (<AppId>) cannot be found. Provide a valid application ID and try again.
    
Most commonly caused when verification is being performed via Graph API, and the id of the application provided is incorrect. Note- the id of the application must be provided, not the AppId/ClientId.

### B2CTenantNotAllowed	 

This capability is not supported in an Azure AD B2C tenant. 

### EmailVerifiedTenantNotAllowed	 

This capability is not supported in an email verified tenant. 

### NoPublisherDomainOnApplication	 

The target application (\<AppId\>) must have a Publisher Domain set. Set a Publisher Domain and try again.

Occurs when a [Publisher Domain](howto-configure-publisher-domain.md) is not configured on the app.

### PublisherDomainMismatch	 

The target application's Publisher Domain (<publisherDomain>) does not match the domain used to perform email verification in Partner Center (<pcDomain>). Ensure these domains match and try again. 
    
Occurs when neither the app's [Publisher Domain](howto-configure-publisher-domain.md) nor one of the [custom domains](../fundamentals/add-custom-domain.md) added to the Azure AD tenant match the domain used to perform email verification in Partner Center.

### NotAuthorizedToVerifyPublisher	 

You are not authorized to set the verified publisher property on application (<AppId>) 
  
Most commonly caused by the signed-in user not being a member of the proper role for the MPN account in Azure AD- see [requirements](publisher-verification-overview.md#requirements) for a list of eligible roles and see [common issues](#common-issues) for more information.

### MPNIdWasNotProvided	 

The MPN ID was not provided in the request body or the request content type was not "application/json". 

### MSANotSupported	 

This feature is not supported for Microsoft consumer accounts. Only applications registered in Azure AD by an Azure AD user are supported.

### InteractionRequired

Occurs when multi-factor authentication has not been performed before attempting to add a verified publisher to the app. See [common issues](#common-issues) for more information. Note: MFA must be performed in the same session when attempting to add a verified publisher. If MFA is enabled but not required to be performed in the session, the request will fail.   

The error message displayed will be: "Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to proceed."
