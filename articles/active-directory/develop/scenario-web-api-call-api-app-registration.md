# Web API that calls web APIs - app registration

A web API that calls downstream web APIs has the same registration as a protected web API. Therefore, you'll need to follow the instructions in [Protected Web API - app registration](scenario-protected-web-api-app-registration.md).

However, since the web app now calls web APIs, it becomes a confidential client application. That's why there's extra registration info that's required: the app needs to share secrets (client credentials) with the Microsoft identity platform.

## API permissions

Web applications call APIs on behalf of the user for whom the bearer token was received. They need to request delegated permissions. For details, see [Add permissions to access web APIs](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis).
