# Brokered auth in Android

## Introduction

You must use one of Microsoft's authentication brokers to participate in device-wide Single Sign-On (SSO) and to meet organizational Conditional Access policies. Integrating with a broker provides the following benefits:

- Device single sign-on
- Conditional access for:
  - Intune App Protection
  - Device Registration (Workplace Join)
  - Mobile Device Management
- Device-wide Account Management
  -  via Android AccountManager & Account Settings
  - "Work Account" - custom account type

On Android, the Microsoft Authentication Broker is a component that's included with [Microsoft Authenticator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator) and [Intune Company Portal ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal)

> [!TIP]
> Only one application that hosts the broker will be active as the broker at a time. Which application is active as a broker is determined by installation order on the device. The first to be installed, or the last present on the device, becomes the active broker.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between your app, the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), and Microsoft's authentication brokers.

## Installing apps that host a broker

Broker-hosting apps can be installed by the device owner from their app store (typically Google Play Store) at any time. However, some APIs (resources) are protected by Conditional Access Policies that require devices to be:

- registered (workplace joined) and/or
- enrolled in Device Management or
- enrolled in Intune App Protection

If a device does not already have a broker app installed, MSAL instructs the user to install one as soon as the app attempts to get a token interactively. The app will then need to lead the user through the steps to make the device compliant with the required policy.

## Effects of installing and uninstalling a broker

### When a broker is installed

When a broker is installed on a device, all subsequent interactive token requests (calls to `acquireToken()`) are handled by the broker rather than locally by MSAL. Any SSO state previously available to MSAL is not available to the broker. As a result, the user will need to authenticate again, or select an account from the existing list of accounts known to the device.

Installing a broker does not require the user to sign in again. Only when the user needs to resolve an `MsalUiRequiredException` will the next request go to the broker. `MsalUiRequiredException` is thrown for a number of reasons, and needs to be resolved interactively. These are some common reasons:

- The user changed the password associated with their account.
- The user's account no longer meets a Conditional Access policy.
- The user revoked their consent for the app to be associated with their account.

### When a broker is uninstalled

If there is only one broker hosting app installed, and it is removed, then the user will need to sign in again. Uninstalling the active broker removes the account and associated tokens from the device.

If Intune Company Portal is installed and is operating as the active broker, and Microsoft Authenticator is also installed, then if the Intune Company Portal (active broker) is uninstalled the user will need to sign in again. Once they sign in again, the Microsoft Authenticator app  becomes the active broker.

## Integrating with a broker

### Generating a redirect URI for a broker

You must register a redirect URI that is compatible with the broker. The redirect URI for the broker needs to include your app's package name, as well as the base64 encoded representation of your app's signature.

The format of the redirect URI is: `msauth://<yourpackagename>/<base64urlencodedsignature>`

Generate your Base64 url encoded signature using your app's signing keys. Here are some example  commands that use your debug signing keys:

#### macOS

```bash
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
```

#### Windows

```powershell
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore %HOMEPATH%\.android\debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
```

See [Sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing) for information about signing your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use your production signing key for the production version of your app.

### Configure MSAL to use a broker

To use a broker in your app, you must attest that you've configured your broker redirect. For example, include both your broker enabled redirect URI--and indicate that you registered it--by including the following in your MSAL configuration file:

```javascript
"redirect_uri" : "<yourbrokerredirecturi>",
"broker_redirect_uri_registered": true
```

> [!TIP]
> The new Azure portal app registration UI helps you generate the broker redirect URI. If you registered your app using the older experience, or did so using the Microsoft app registration portal, you may need to generate the redirect URI and update the list of redirect URIs in the portal manually.

### Broker-related exceptions

MSAL communicates with the broker in two ways:

- Broker bound service
- Android AccountManager

MSAL first uses the broker bound service because calling this service doesn't require any  Android permissions. If binding to the bound service fails, MSAL will use the Android AccountManager API. MSAL only does this if your app has already been granted the `"READ_CONTACTS"` permission.

If you get an `MsalClientException` with error code `"BROKER_BIND_FAILURE"`, then there are two options:

- Ask the user to disable power optimization for the Microsoft Authenticator app and the Intune Company Portal.
- Ask the user to grant the `"READ_CONTACTS"` permission
