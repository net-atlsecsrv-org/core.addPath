# Desktop app that calls web APIs - call a web API

Now that you have a token, you can call a protected web API.

## Calling a web API from .NET

[!INCLUDE [Call web API in .NET](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-scenarios-call-apis-dotnet.md)]

<!--
More includes will come later for Python and Java
-->

## Calling several APIs - Incremental consent and conditional access

If you need to call several APIs for the same user, once you got a token for the first API, you can just call `AcquireTokenSilent`, and you'll get a token for the other APIs silently most of the time.

```CSharp
var result = await app.AcquireTokenXX("scopeApi1")
                      .ExecuteAsync();

result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent("scopeApi2")
                  .ExecuteAsync();
```

The cases where interaction is required is when:

- The user consented for the first API, but now needs to consent for more scopes (incremental consent)
- The first API didn't require multiple-factor authentication, but the next one does.

```CSharp
var result = await app.AcquireTokenXX("scopeApi1")
                      .ExecuteAsync();

try
{
 result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent("scopeApi2")
                  .ExecuteAsync();
}
catch(MsalUiRequiredException ex)
{
 result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive("scopeApi2")
                  .WithClaims(ex.Claims)
                  .ExecuteAsync();
}
```
