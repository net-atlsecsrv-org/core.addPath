# Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices (Preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This feature [!INCLUDE [PREVIEW BOILERPLATE](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-preview.md)]

The *Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices* provides single sign-on (SSO) for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts across all applications that support Apple's [Enterprise Single Sign-On](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices) feature. Microsoft worked closely with Apple to develop this plug-in to increase your application's usability while providing the best protection that Apple and Microsoft can provide.

In this Public Preview release, the Enterprise SSO plug-in is available only for iOS devices and is distributed in certain Microsoft applications.

## Features

The Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices offers the following benefits:

- Provides SSO for Azure AD accounts across all applications that support Apple's Enterprise Single Sign-On feature.
- Delivered automatically in the Microsoft Authenticator and can be enabled by any mobile device management (MDM) solution.

## Requirements

To use Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices:

- iOS 13.0 or higher must be installed on the device.
- A Microsoft application that provides the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices must be installed on the device. For Public Preview, these applications include the [Microsoft Authenticator app](../user-help/user-help-auth-app-overview.md).
- Device must be MDM-enrolled (for example, with Microsoft Intune).
- Configuration must be pushed to the device to enable the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices on the device. This security constraint is required by Apple.

## Enable the SSO plug-in with mobile device management (MDM)

To enable the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices, your devices need to be sent a signal through an MDM service. Since Microsoft includes the Enterprise SSO plug-in in the [Microsoft Authenticator app](..//user-help/user-help-auth-app-overview.md), use your MDM to configure the app to enable the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in.

Use the following parameters to configure the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices:

- **Type**: Redirect
- **Extension ID**: `com.microsoft.azureauthenticator.ssoextension`
- **Team ID**: (this field is not needed for iOS)
- **URLs**:
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.com`
  - `https://login.microsoft.com`
  - `https://sts.windows.net`
  - `https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn`
  - `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn`
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.de`
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.us`
  - `https://login.usgovcloudapi.net`
  - `https://login-us.microsoftonline.com`
  
### Additional configuration options
Additional configuration options can be added to extend SSO functionality to additional apps.

#### Enable SSO for apps that don't use MSAL

The SSO plug-in allows any application to participate in single sign-on even if it was not developed using a Microsoft SDK like the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).

The SSO plug-in is installed automatically by devices that have downloaded the Microsoft Authenticator app and registered their device with your organization. Your organization likely uses the Authenticator app today for scenarios like multi-factor authentication, password-less authentication, and conditional access. It can be turned on for your applications using any MDM provider, although Microsoft has made it easy to configure inside the Microsoft Endpoint Manager of Intune. An allow list is used to configure these applications to use the SSO plugin installed by the Authenticator app.

Only apps that use native Apple network technologies or webviews are supported. If an application ships its own network layer implementation, Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in is not supported.  

Use the following parameters to configure the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for apps that don't use MSAL:

- **Key**: `AppAllowList`
- **Type**: `String`
- **Value**: Comma-delimited list of application bundle IDs for the applications that are allowed to participate in the SSO
- **Example**: `com.contoso.workapp, com.contoso.travelapp`

[Consented apps](./application-consent-experience.md) that are allowed by the MDM admin to participate in the SSO can silently get a token for the end user. Therefore, it is important to only add trusted applications to the allow list. 

You don't need to add applications that use MSAL or ASWebAuthenticationSession to this list. Those applications are enabled by default. 

#### Allow creating SSO session from any application

By default, the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in provides SSO for authorized apps only when the SSO plug-in already has a shared credential. The Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in can acquire a shared credential when it is called by another ADAL or MSAL-based application during token acquisition. Most of the Microsoft apps use Microsoft Authenticator or SSO plug-in. That means that by default SSO outside of native app flows is best effort.  

Enabling `browser_sso_interaction_enabled` flag enables non-MSAL apps and Safari browser to do the initial bootstrapping and get a shared credential. If the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in doesn’t have a shared credential yet, it will try to get one whenever a sign-in is requested from an Azure AD URL inside Safari browser, ASWebAuthenticationSession, SafariViewController, or another permitted native application.  

- **Key**: `browser_sso_interaction_enabled`
- **Type**: `Integer`
- **Value**: 1 or 0

We recommend enabling this flag to get more consistent experience across all apps. It is disabled by default. 

#### Disable OAuth2 application prompts

The Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in provides SSO by appending shared credentials to network requests coming from allowed applications. Some OAuth2 applications might be enforcing end-user prompt on the protocol layer. Shared credential would be ignored for those apps.  

Enabling `disable_explicit_app_prompt` flag restricts ability of both native and web applications to force an end-user prompt on the protocol layer and bypass SSO.

- **Key**: `disable_explicit_app_prompt`
- **Type**: `Integer`
- **Value**: 1 or 0

We recommend enabling this flag to get more consistent experience across all apps. It is disabled by default. 

#### Use Intune for simplified configuration

You can use Microsoft Intune as your MDM service to ease configuration of the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in. For more information, see the [Intune configuration documentation](/intune/configuration/ios-device-features-settings).

## Using the SSO plug-in in your application

The [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Apple devices](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc) version 1.1.0 and higher supports the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices.

If you're building an application for Frontline Worker scenarios, see [Shared device mode for iOS devices](msal-ios-shared-devices.md) for additional setup of the feature.

## How the SSO plug-in works

The Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in relies on the [Apple's Enterprise Single Sign-On framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationsinglesignonprovider?language=objc). Identity providers that onboard to the framework can intercept network traffic for their domains and enhance or change how those requests are handled. For example, the SSO plug-in can show additional UI to collect end-user credentials securely, require MFA, or silently provide tokens to the application.

Native applications can also implement custom operations and talk directly to the SSO plug-in.
You can learn about Single Sign-in framework in this [2019 WWDC video from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/301/)

### Applications that use MSAL

The [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Apple devices](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc) version 1.1.0 and higher supports the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices natively for work and school accounts. 

There's no special configuration needed if you've followed [all recommended steps](./quickstart-v2-ios.md) and used the default [redirect URI format](./redirect-uris-ios.md). When running on a device that has the SSO plug-in present, MSAL will automatically invoke it for all interactive and silent token requests, as well as account enumeration and account removal operations. Since MSAL implements native SSO plug-in protocol that relies on custom operations, this setup provides the smoothest native experience to the end user. 

If the SSO plug-in is not enabled by MDM, but the Microsoft Authenticator app is present on the device, MSAL will instead use the Microsoft Authenticator app for any interactive token requests. The SSO plug-in shares SSO with the Microsoft Authenticator app.

### Applications that don't use MSAL

Applications that don't use MSAL can still get SSO if an administrator adds them to the allow list explicitly. 

There are no code changes needed in those apps as long as following conditions are satisfied:

- Application is using Apple frameworks to execute network requests (for example, [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview), [NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession)) 
- Application is using standard protocols to communicate with Azure AD (for example, OAuth2, SAML, WS-Federation)
- Application doesn't collect plaintext username and password in the native UI

In this case, SSO is provided when the application creates a network request and opens a web browser to sign the user in. When a user is redirected to an Azure AD login URL, the SSO plug-in validates the URL and checks if there is an SSO credential available for that URL. If there is one, the SSO plug-in passes the SSO credential to Azure AD, which authorizes the application to complete the network request without asking the user to enter their credentials. Additionally, if the device is known to Azure AD, the SSO plug-in will also pass the device certificate to satisfy the device-based conditional access check. 

To support SSO for non-MSAL apps, the SSO plug-in implements a protocol similar to the Windows browser plug-in described in [What is a Primary Refresh Token?](../devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md#browser-sso-using-prt). 

Compared to MSAL-based apps, the SSO plug-in acts more transparently for non-MSAL apps by integrating with the existing browser login experience that apps provide. The end user would see their familiar experience, with the benefit of not having to perform additional sign-ins in each of the applications. For example, instead of displaying the native account picker, the SSO plug-in adds SSO sessions to the web-based account picker experience.
