# Support and help options for developers

If you're just starting to integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft identities, or Microsoft Graph API, or when you're implementing a new feature to your application, there are times when you need to obtain help from the community or understand the support options that you have as a developer. This article helps you to understand these options, including:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * How to search whether your question hasn't been answered by the community, or if an existing documentation for the feature you're trying to implement already exists
> * In some cases, you just want to use our support tools to help you debug a specific problem
> * If you can't find the answer that you need, you may want to ask a question on *Microsoft Q&A*
> * If you find an issue with one of our authentication libraries, raise a *GitHub* issue
> * Finally, if you need to talk to someone, you might want to open a support request

## Search

If you have a development-related question, you may be able to find the answer in the documentation, [GitHub samples](https://github.com/azure-samples), or answers to [Microsoft Q&A](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/products/) questions.

### Scoped search

For faster results, scope your search to [Microsoft Q&A](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/products/)the documentation, and the code samples by using the following query in your favorite search engine:

```
{Your Search Terms} (site:http://www.docs.microsoft.com/answers/products/ OR site:docs.microsoft.com OR site:github.com/azure-samples OR site:cloudidentity.com OR site:developer.microsoft.com/graph)
```

Where *{Your Search Terms}* correspond to your search keywords.

## Use the development support tools

| Tool  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms) | Paste an ID or access token to decode the claims names and values. |
| [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer)| Tool that lets you make requests and see responses against the Microsoft Graph API. |

## Post a question to Microsoft Q&A

[Microsoft Q&A](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/products/) is the preferred channel for development-related questions. Here, members of the developer community and Microsoft team members are directly involved in helping you to solve your problems.

If you can't find an answer to your question through search, submit a new question to [Microsoft Q&A](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/products/) . Use one of the following tags when asking questions to help the community identify and answer your question more quickly:
