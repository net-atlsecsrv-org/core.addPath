# How to change the token lifetime defaults for a custom-developed application

This article shows how to use Azure AD PowerShell to set a token lifetime policy. Azure AD Premium allows app developers and tenant admins to configure the lifetime of tokens issued for non-confidential clients. Token lifetime policies are set on a tenant-wide basis or the resources being accessed.

1. To set a token lifetime policy, you need to download the [Azure AD PowerShell Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview).
1. Run the **Connect-AzureAD -Confirm** command.

    Hereâ€™s an example policy that sets the max age single factor refresh token. Create the policy:
  ```New-AzureADPolicy -Definition @('{"TokenLifetimePolicy":{"Version":1, "MaxAgeSingleFactor":"until-revoked"}}') -DisplayName "OrganizationDefaultPolicyScenario" -IsOrganizationDefault $true -Type "TokenLifetimePolicy"```
