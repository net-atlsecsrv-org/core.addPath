# How to change the token lifetime defaults for a custom-developed application

This article shows how to use Azure AD PowerShell to set a token lifetime policy. Azure AD Premium allows app developers and tenant admins to configure the lifetime of tokens issued for non-confidential clients. Token lifetime policies are set on a tenant-wide basis or the resources being accessed.

To set a token lifetime policy, you need to download the [Azure AD PowerShell Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview).
Run the **Connect-AzureAD -Confirm** command.

Hereâ€™s an example policy that requires users to authenticate more frequently in your web app. This policy sets the lifetime of the access/ID tokens and the max age of a multi-factor session token to the service principal of your web app. Create the policy and assign it to your service principal. You also need to get the ObjectId of your service principal.

```powershell
$policy = New-AzureADPolicy -Definition @('{"TokenLifetimePolicy":{"Version":1,"AccessTokenLifetime":"02:00:00","MaxAgeSessionSingleFactor":"02:00:00"}}') -DisplayName "WebPolicyScenario" -IsOrganizationDefault $false -Type "TokenLifetimePolicy"

$sp = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "DisplayName eq '<service principal display name>'"

Add-AzureADServicePrincipalPolicy -Id $sp.ObjectId -RefObjectId $policy.Id
```
