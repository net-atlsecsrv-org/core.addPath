# Use Microsoft Authenticator or Microsoft Intune Company Portal on Xamarin applications

On Android and iOS, brokers like Microsoft Authenticator or Microsoft Intune Company Portal enable (Android only):

- Single sign-on (SSO). Your users won't need to sign in to each application.
- Device identification. The broker accesses the device certificate, which was created on the device when it was workplace joined.
- Application identification verification. When an application calls the broker, it passes its redirect URL, and the broker verifies it.

To enable one of these features, application developers need to use the `WithBroker()` parameter when they call the `PublicClientApplicationBuilder.CreateApplication` method. `.WithBroker()` is set to true by default. Developers also need to follow the steps here for [iOS](#brokered-authentication-for-ios) or [Android](#brokered-authentication-for-android) applications.

## Brokered authentication for iOS

Follow these steps to enable your Xamarin.iOS app to talk with the [Microsoft Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) app.

### Step 1: Enable broker support
Broker support is enabled on a per-PublicClientApplication basis. It's disabled by default. Use the `WithBroker()` parameter (set to true by default) when you create the PublicClientApplication through the PublicClientApplicationBuilder.

```csharp
var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
                .Create(ClientId)
                .WithBroker()
                .WithReplyUri(redirectUriOnIos) // $"msauth.{Bundle.Id}://auth" (see step 6 below)
                .Build();
```

### Step 2: Enable keychain access

To enable keychain access, your application must have a keychain access group. You can use the `WithIosKeychainSecurityGroup()` API to set your keychain access group when you create your application:

```csharp
var builder = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
     .Create(ClientId)
      
     .WithIosKeychainSecurityGroup("com.microsoft.adalcache")
     .Build();
```

For more information, see [Enable keychain access](msal-net-xamarin-ios-considerations.md#enable-keychain-access).

### Step 3: Update AppDelegate to handle the callback
When the Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET) calls the broker, the broker in turn calls back to your application through the `OpenUrl` method of the `AppDelegate` class. Because MSAL waits for the response from the broker, your application needs to cooperate to call MSAL.NET back. To enable this cooperation, update the `AppDelegate.cs` file to override the following method.

```csharp
public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication app, NSUrl url, 
                             string sourceApplication,
                             NSObject annotation)
{
    if (AuthenticationContinuationHelper.IsBrokerResponse(sourceApplication))
    {
      AuthenticationContinuationHelper.SetBrokerContinuationEventArgs(url);
      return true;
    }
    
    else if (!AuthenticationContinuationHelper.SetAuthenticationContinuationEventArgs(url))
    {	            
         return false;	              
    }
	
    return true;	 
}	        
```

This method is invoked every time the application is launched. It's used as an opportunity to process the response from the broker and complete the authentication process initiated by MSAL.NET.

### Step 4: Set a UIViewController()
Still in `AppDelegate.cs`, you need to set an object window. Normally, with Xamarin iOS, you don't need to set the object window. To send and receive responses from the broker, you need an object window. 

To do this, you do two things. 
1. In `AppDelegate.cs`, set the `App.RootViewController` to a new `UIViewController()`. This assignment makes sure there's a UIViewController with the call to the broker. If it isn't set correctly, you might get this error:
`"uiviewcontroller_required_for_ios_broker":"UIViewController is null, so MSAL.NET cannot invoke the iOS broker. See https://aka.ms/msal-net-ios-broker"`
1. On the AcquireTokenInteractive call, use the `.WithParentActivityOrWindow(App.RootViewController)` and pass in the reference to the object window you'll use.

**For example:**

In `App.cs`:
```csharp
   public static object RootViewController { get; set; }
```
In `AppDelegate.cs`:
```csharp
   LoadApplication(new App());
   App.RootViewController = new UIViewController();
```
In the acquire token call:
```csharp
result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
             .WithParentActivityOrWindow(App.RootViewController)
             .ExecuteAsync();
```

### Step 5: Register a URL scheme
MSAL.NET uses URLs to invoke the broker and then return the broker response back to your app. To finish the round trip, register a URL scheme for your app in the `Info.plist` file.

The `CFBundleURLSchemes` name must include `msauth.` as a prefix, followed by your `CFBundleURLName`.

`$"msauth.(BundleId)"`

**For example:**

`msauth.com.yourcompany.xforms`

> [!NOTE]
> This URL scheme becomes part of the redirect URI that's used to uniquely identify your app when it receives the response from the broker.

```XML
 <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>com.yourcompany.xforms</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
          <string>msauth.com.yourcompany.xforms</string>
        </array>
      </dict>
    </array>
```

### Step 6: Add the broker identifier to the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes section
MSAL uses `â€“canOpenURL:` to check if the broker is installed on the device. In iOS 9, Apple locked down what schemes an application can query for. 

Add `msauthv2` to the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` section of the `Info.plist` file.

```XML 
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>msauthv2</string>
      <string>msauthv3</string>
    </array>
```

### Step 7: Register your redirect URI in the application portal
Using the broker adds an extra requirement on your redirect URI. The redirect URI _must_ have the following format:
```csharp
$"msauth.{BundleId}://auth"
```
**For example:**
```csharp
public static string redirectUriOnIos = "msauth.com.yourcompany.XForms://auth"; 
```
Notice that the redirect URI matches the `CFBundleURLSchemes` name you included in the `Info.plist` file.

### Step 8: Make sure the redirect URI is registered with your app

This redirect URI needs to be registered on the app registration portal (https://portal.azure.com) as a valid redirect URI for your application. 

The portal has a new experience app registration portal to help you compute the brokered reply URI from the bundle ID.

1. In the app registration, choose **Authentication** and select **Try out the new experience**.

1. Select **Add a platform**.

1. When the list of platforms is supported, select **iOS**.

1. Enter your bundle ID as requested, and then select **Configure**.

## Brokered authentication for Android

MSAL.NET only support the Xamarin.iOS platform at the moment. It doesn't yet support brokers for the Xamarin.Android platform.

The MSAL Android native library already supports it. For details see [Brokered auth in Android](brokered-auth.md)
