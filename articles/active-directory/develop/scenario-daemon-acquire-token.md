# Daemon app that calls web APIs - acquire a token

Once the confidential client application is constructed, you can acquire a token for the app by calling ``AcquireTokenForClient``, passing the scope, and forcing or not a refresh of the token.

## Scopes to request

The scope to request for a client credential flow is the name of the resource followed by `/.default`. This notation tells Azure AD to use the **application level permissions** declared statically during the application registration. Also, as seen previously, these API permissions must be granted by a tenant administrator

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
ResourceId = "someAppIDURI";
var scopes = new [] {  ResourceId+"/.default"};
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

In MSAL Python, the configuration file would look like the following code snippet:

```Json
{
    "scope": ["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"],
}
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```Java
final static String GRAPH_DEFAULT_SCOPE = "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default";
```

### Case of Azure AD (v1.0) resources

The scope used for client credentials should always be resourceId+"/.default"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For MSAL asking an access token for a resource accepting a v1.0 access token, Azure AD parses the desired audience from the requested scope by taking everything before the last slash and using it as the resource identifier.
> Therefore if, like Azure SQL (**https://database.windows.net**) the resource expects an audience ending with a slash (for Azure SQL: `https://database.windows.net/`), you'll need to request a scope of `https://database.windows.net//.default` (note the double slash). See also MSAL.NET issue [#747](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/747): Resource url's trailing slash is omitted, which caused sql auth failure.

## AcquireTokenForClient API

To acquire a token for the app, you'll use `AcquireTokenForClient` or the equivalent depending on the platforms.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;

// With client credentials flows the scopes is ALWAYS of the shape "resource/.default", as the
// application permissions need to be set statically (in the portal or by PowerShell), and then granted by
// a tenant administrator
string[] scopes = new string[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };

AuthenticationResult result = null;
try
{
 result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
                  .ExecuteAsync();
}
catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex)
{
    // The application does not have sufficient permissions
    // - did you declare enough app permissions in during the app creation?
    // - did the tenant admin needs to grant permissions to the application.
}
catch (MsalServiceException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("AADSTS70011"))
{
    // Invalid scope. The scope has to be of the form "https://resourceurl/.default"
    // Mitigation: change the scope to be as expected !
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```Python
# The pattern to acquire a token looks like this.
result = None

# Firstly, looks up a token from cache
# Since we are looking for token for the current app, NOT for an end user,
# notice we give account parameter as None.
result = app.acquire_token_silent(config["scope"], account=None)

if not result:
    logging.info("No suitable token exists in cache. Let's get a new one from AAD.")
    result = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=config["scope"])

if "access_token" in result:
    # Call a protected API with the access token
    print(result["token_type"])
else:
    print(result.get("error"))
    print(result.get("error_description"))
    print(result.get("correlation_id"))  # You may need this when reporting a bug
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

This is an extract from the [MSAL Java dev samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/blob/dev/src/samples/confidential-client/).

```Java
ClientCredentialParameters clientCredentialParam = ClientCredentialParameters.builder(
        Collections.singleton(GRAPH_DEFAULT_SCOPE))
        .build();

CompletableFuture<IAuthenticationResult> future = app.acquireToken(clientCredentialParam);

BiConsumer<IAuthenticationResult, Throwable> processAuthResult = (res, ex) -> {
    if (ex != null) {
        System.out.println("Oops! We have an exception - " + ex.getMessage());
    }
    System.out.println("Returned ok - " + res);
    System.out.println("ID Token - " + res.idToken());

    /* call a protected API with res.accessToken() */
};

future.whenCompleteAsync(processAuthResult);
future.join();
```

### Protocol

If you don't have yet a library for your language of choice, you might want to use  the protocol directly:

#### First case: Access token request with a shared secret

```Text
POST /{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1           //Line breaks for clarity
Host: login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=535fb089-9ff3-47b6-9bfb-4f1264799865
&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default
&client_secret=qWgdYAmab0YSkuL1qKv5bPX
&grant_type=client_credentials
```

#### Second case: Access token request with a certificate

```Text
POST /{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1               // Line breaks for clarity
Host: login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default
&client_id=97e0a5b7-d745-40b6-94fe-5f77d35c6e05
&client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Imd4OHRHeXN5amNScUtqRlBuZDdSRnd2d1pJMCJ9.eyJ{a lot of characters here}M8U3bSUKKJDEg
&grant_type=client_credentials
```

For more information, see the protocol documentation: [Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md).

## Application token cache

In MSAL.NET, `AcquireTokenForClient` uses the **application token cache** (All the other AcquireTokenXX methods use the user token cache)
Don't call `AcquireTokenSilent` before calling `AcquireTokenForClient` as `AcquireTokenSilent` uses the **user** token cache. `AcquireTokenForClient` checks the **application** token cache itself and updates it.

## Troubleshooting

### Did you use the resource/.default scope?

If you get an error message telling you that you used an invalid scope, you probably didn't use the `resource/.default` scope.

### Did you forget to provide admin consent? Daemon apps need it!

If you get an error when calling the API **Insufficient privileges to complete the operation**, the tenant administrator needs to grant permissions to the application. See step 6 of Register the client app above.
You'll typically see and error like the following error description:

```JSon
Failed to call the web API: Forbidden
Content: {
  "error": {
    "code": "Authorization_RequestDenied",
    "message": "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation.",
    "innerError": {
      "request-id": "<guid>",
      "date": "<date>"
    }
  }
}
```
