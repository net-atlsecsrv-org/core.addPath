# Validation differences by supported account types (signInAudience)

When registering an application with the Microsoft identity platform for developers, you are asked to select which account types your application supports. In the application object and manifest, this property is `signInAudience`.

The options include the following:

- *AzureADMyOrg*: Only accounts in the organizational directory where the app is registered (single-tenant)
- *AzureADMultipleOrgs*: Accounts in any organizational directory (multi-tenant)
- *AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount*: Accounts in any organizational directory (multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com)

For registered applications, you can find the value for Supported account types on the **Authentication** section of an application. You can also find it under the `signInAudience` property in the **Manifest**.

The value you select for this property has implications on other app object properties. As a result, if you change this property you may need to change other properties first.

See the following table for the validation differences of various properties for different supported account types.
