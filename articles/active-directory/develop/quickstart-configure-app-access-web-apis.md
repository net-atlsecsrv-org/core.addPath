# Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs

For a web/confidential client application to be able to participate in an authorization grant flow that requires authentication (and obtain an access token), it must establish secure credentials. The default authentication method supported by the Azure portal is client ID + secret key.

Additionally, before a client can access a web API exposed by a resource application (such as Microsoft Graph API), the consent framework ensures the client obtains the permission grant required based on the permissions requested. By default, all applications can choose permissions from the Microsoft Graph API. The [Graph API “Sign-in and read user profile” permission](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference#user-permissions) is selected by default. You can select from [two types of permissions](developer-glossary.md#permissions) for each desired web API:

* **Application permissions** - Your client application needs to access the web API directly as itself (no user context). This type of permission requires administrator consent and is also not available for public (desktop and mobile) client applications.
* **Delegated permissions** - Your client application needs to access the web API as the signed-in user, but with access limited by the selected permission. This type of permission can be granted by a user unless the permission requires administrator consent.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Adding a delegated permission to an application does not automatically grant consent to the users within the tenant. Users must still manually consent for the added delegated permissions at runtime, unless the administrator grants consent on behalf of all users.

In this quickstart, we'll show you how to configure your app to:

* [Add redirect URIs to your application](#add-redirect-uris-to-your-application)
* [Configure advanced settings for your application](#configure-advanced-settings-for-your-application)
* [Modify supported account types](#modify-supported-account-types)
* [Add credentials to your web application](#add-credentials-to-your-web-application)
* [Add permissions to access web APIs](#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis)

## Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you complete these prerequisites:

* Learn about the supported [permissions and consent](v2-permissions-and-consent.md), which is important to understand when building applications that need to be used by other users or applications.
* Have a tenant that has applications registered to it.
  * If you don't have apps registered, [learn how to register applications with the Microsoft identity platform](quickstart-register-app.md).

## Sign in to the Azure portal and select the app

Before you can configure the app, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top-right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**. 
1. From the left pane, select **App registrations**.
1. Find and select the application you want to configure. Once you've selected the app, you'll see the application's **Overview** or main registration page.
1. Follow the steps to configure your application to access web APIs:
    * [Add redirect URIs to your application](#add-redirect-uris-to-your-application)
    * [Configure advanced settings for your application](#configure-advanced-settings-for-your-application)
    * [Modify supported account types](#modify-supported-account-types)
    * [Add credentials to your web application](#add-credentials-to-your-web-application)
    * [Add permissions to access web APIs](#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis)

## Add redirect URI(s) to your application

To add a redirect URI to your application:

1. From the app's **Overview** page, select the **Authentication** section.
1. To add a custom redirect URI for web and public client applications, follow these steps:
   1. Locate the **Redirect URI** section.
   1. Select the type of application you're building, **Web** or **Public client (mobile & desktop)**.
   1. Enter the Redirect URI for your application.
      * For web applications, provide the base URL of your application. For example, `http://localhost:31544` might be the URL for a web application running on your local machine. Users would use this URL to sign into a web client application.
      * For public applications, provide the URI used by Azure AD to return token responses. Enter a value specific to your application, for example: `https://MyFirstApp`.

1. To choose from suggested Redirect URIs for public clients (mobile, desktop), follow these steps:
    1. Locate the Suggested **Redirect URIs for public clients (mobile, desktop)** section.
    1. Select the appropriate Redirect URI(s) for your application using the checkboxes. You can also enter a custom redirect URI. If you're not sure what to use, check out the library documentation.

There are certain restrictions that apply to redirect URIs. Learn more about [redirect URI restrictions and limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url).

### Configure advanced settings for your application

Depending on the application you're registering, there are some additional settings that you may need to configure, such as:

* **Logout URL**
* For single-page apps, you can enable **Implicit grant** and select the tokens that you'd like the authorization endpoint to issue.
* For desktop apps that are acquiring tokens with Integrated Windows Authentication, device code flow, or username/password in the **Default client type** section, configure the **Treat application as public client** setting to **Yes**.
* For legacy apps that were using the Live SDK to integrate with the Microsoft account service, configure **Live SDK support**. New apps don't need this setting.
* **Default client type**

### Modify supported account types

The **Supported account types** specify who can use the application or access the API.

Once you've [configured the supported account types](quickstart-register-app.md) when you initially registered the application, you can only change this setting using the application manifest editor if:

* You change account types from **AzureADMyOrg** or **AzureADMultipleOrgs** to **AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount**, or vice versa.
* You change account types from **AzureADMyOrg** to **AzureADMultipleOrgs**, or vice versa.

To change the supported account types for an existing app registration:

* See [Configure the application manifest](reference-app-manifest.md) and update the `signInAudience` key.

## Configure platform settings for your application

[![Configure settings for your app based on the platform or device](./media/quickstart-update-azure-ad-app-preview/authentication-new-platform-configurations-expanded.png)](./media/quickstart-update-azure-ad-app-preview/authentication-new-platform-configurations-small.png#lightbox)

To configure application settings based on the platform or device, you're targeting:

1. In the **Platform configurations** page, select **Add a platform** and choose from the available options.

   ![Shows the Configure platforms page](./media/quickstart-update-azure-ad-app-preview/authentication-platform-configurations-configure-platforms.png)

1. Enter the settings info based on the platform you selected.

   | Platform                | Choices              | Configuration settings            |
   |-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | **Web applications**    | **Web**              | Enter the **Redirect URI** for your application. |
   | **Mobile applications** | **iOS**              | Enter the app's **Bundle ID**, which you can find in XCode in Info.plist, or Build Settings. Adding the bundle ID automatically creates a redirect URI for the application. |
   |                         | **Android**          | * Provide the app's **Package name**, which you can find in the AndroidManifest.xml file.<br/>* Generate and enter the **Signature hash**. Adding the signature hash automatically creates a redirect URI for the application.  |
   | **Desktop + devices**   | **Desktop + devices** | * Optional. Select one of the recommended **Suggested redirect URIs** if you're building apps for desktop and devices.<br/>* Optional. Enter a **Custom redirect URI**, which is used as the location where Azure AD will redirect users in response to authentication requests. For example, for .NET Core applications where you want interaction, use `https://localhost`. |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For mobile applications that aren't using the latest MSAL library or not using a broker, you must configure the redirect URIs for these applications in **Desktop + devices**.

1. Depending on the platform you chose, there may be additional settings that you can configure. For **Web** apps, you can:
    * Add more redirect URIs
    * Configure **Implicit grant** to select the tokens you'd like to be issued by the authorization endpoint:
        * For single-page apps, select both **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**
        * For web apps, select **ID tokens**

## Add credentials to your web application

To add a credential to your web application:

1. From the app's **Overview** page, select the **Certificates & secrets** section.

1. To add a certificate, follow these steps:

    1. Select **Upload certificate**.
    1. Select the file you'd like to upload. It must be one of the following file types: .cer, .pem, .crt.
    1. Select **Add**.

1. To add a client secret, follow these steps:

    1. Select **New client secret**.
    1. Add a description for your client secret.
    1. Select a duration.
    1. Select **Add**.

> [!NOTE]
> After you save the configuration changes, the right-most column will contain the client secret value. **Be sure to copy the value** for use in your client application code as it's not accessible once you leave this page.

## Add permissions to access web APIs

To add permission(s) to access resource APIs from your client:

1. From the app's **Overview** page, select **API permissions**.
1. Under the **Configured permissions** section, select the **Add a permission** button.
1. By default, the view allows you to select from **Microsoft APIs**. Select the section of APIs that you're interested in:
    * **Microsoft APIs** - Lets you select permissions for Microsoft APIs such as Microsoft Graph.
    * **APIs my organization uses** - Lets you select permissions for APIs that have been exposed by your organization, or APIs that your organization has integrated with.
    * **My APIs** - Lets you select permissions for APIs that you have exposed.
1. Once you've selected the APIs, you'll see the **Request API Permissions** page. If the API exposes both delegated and application permissions, select which type of permission your application needs.
1. When finished, select **Add permissions**. You will return to the **API permissions** page, where the permissions have been saved and added to the table.

## Understanding API permissions and admin consent UI

### Configured permissions

This section shows the permissions that have been explicitly configured on the application object (\the permissions that are part of the app's required resource access list). You may add or remove permissions from this table. As an admin, you can also grant/revoke admin consent for a set of an API's permissions or individual permissions in this section.

### Other permissions granted

If your application is registered in a tenant, you may see an additional section titled **Other permissions granted for Tenant**. This section shows permissions that have been granted for the tenant but have not been explicitly configured on the application object (e.g. permissions that were dynamically requested and consented). This section only appears if there is at least one permission that applies.

You may add a set of an API's permissions or individual permissions that appear in this section to the **Configured permissions** section. As an admin, you can also revoke admin consent for individual APIs or permissions in this section.

### Admin consent button

If your application is registered in a tenant, you will see a **Grant admin consent for Tenant** button. It will be disabled if you are not an admin, or if no permissions have been configured for the application.
This button allows an admin to easily grant admin consent to the permissions configured for the application. Clicking the admin consent button launches a new window with a consent prompt showing all the configured permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a delay between permissions being configured for the application and them appearing on the consent prompt. If you do not see all the configured permissions in the consent prompt, close it and launch it again.

If you have permissions that have been granted but not configured, when clicking the admin consent button you will be prompted to decide how to handle these permissions. You may add them to configured permissions or you may remove them.

The consent prompt provides the option to **Accept** or **Cancel**. If you select **Accept**, admin consent is granted. If you select **Cancel**, admin consent is not granted, and you will see an error stating that consent has been declined.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a delay between granting admin consent (selecting **Accept** on the consent prompt) and the status of admin consent being reflected in the UI.
