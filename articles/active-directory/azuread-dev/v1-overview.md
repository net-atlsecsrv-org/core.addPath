# Azure Active Directory for developers (v1.0) overview

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-azuread-dev](../../../includes/active-directory-azuread-dev.md)]

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud identity service that allows developers to build apps that securely sign in users with a Microsoft work or school account. Azure AD supports developers building both single-tenant, line-of-business (LOB) apps, as well as developers looking to develop multi-tenant apps. In addition to basic sign in, Azure AD also lets apps call both Microsoft APIs like [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) and custom APIs that are built on the Azure AD platform. This documentation shows you how to add Azure AD support to your application by using industry standard protocols like OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the content on this page focuses on the v1.0 endpoint and platform, which supports only Microsoft work or school accounts. If you want to sign in consumer or personal Microsoft accounts, see the information on the [v2.0 endpoint and platform](../develop/v2-overview.md). The v2.0 endpoint offers a unified developer experience for apps that want to sign in all Microsoft identities.

## Get started

The v1.0 quickstarts and tutorials walk you through building an app on your preferred platform using the Azure AD Authentication Library (ADAL) SDK. See the **v1.0 Quickstarts** and **v1.0 Tutorials** in [Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory for developers)](index.yml) to get started.

## How-to guides

See the **v1.0 How-to guides** for detailed info and walkthroughs of the most common tasks in Azure AD.
