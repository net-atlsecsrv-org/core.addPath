# Manage your connected devices from the Devices page

The **Devices** page of the **My Account** portal helps you to manage the devices connected to your work or school account. From the **Devices** page, you can:

- View your work or school account-connected devices.

- Disable any devices you no longer own, have lost, or that have been stolen.

>[!Important]
>This article is intended for users trying to update the device info connected to a work or school account. If you're an administrator looking for information about device management for your employees and other uses, see the [Device Identities Documentation](../devices/index.yml).

## View your connected devices

1. Sign in to your work or school account, and then go to the **My Account** (https://myaccount.microsoft.com/) page.

2. Select **Devices** from the left navigation pane or select the **Manage devices** link from the **Devices** block.

## Disable a device

You can disable any of your connected devices at any time. This is especially important if a device isn't familiar to you or if a device is lost or stolen. After you disable a device, it can no longer be authenticated by your organization, and will be unable to access any of your organization's resources.

>[!Important]
>If you disable a device by mistake, there's no way to undo it. You'll have to contact your organization's administrator to add the device again.

1. Select **Disable** from the device you want to remove.

2. Select **Yes** to confirm you want to disable the device.

## View a BitLocker key

If you're locked out of your device or have a fatal error, you can go to another device and view your BitLocker key from the **My Account** portal.

1. On another device, where you're not locked out, go to the **Devices** page of the **My Account** portal.

2. Select **View Bitlocker Keys** for the locked out device and write down the BitLocker key for your locked device.
