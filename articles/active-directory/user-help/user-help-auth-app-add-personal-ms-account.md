# Add your personal Microsoft accounts

Add your personal Microsoft accounts, such as for Outlook.com and Xbox LIVE to the Microsoft Authenticator app for both the standard two-factor verification process and the passwordless phone sign-in method.

- **Standard two-factor verification method.** Type your username and password into the device you're logging in to, and then choose whether the Microsoft Authenticator app sends a notification or if you'd prefer to copy the associated verification code from the **Accounts** screen of the Microsoft Authenticator app.

- **Passwordless sign-in method.** Type your username into the device you're logging into for your personal Microsoft account, and then use your mobile device to verify it's you by using your fingerprint, face, or PIN. For this method, you don't need to enter your password.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you must download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](user-help-auth-app-download-install.md) article.

## Add your personal Microsoft account

You can add your personal Microsoft account by first turning on two-factor verification, and then by adding the account to the app.

>[!Note]
>if you plan to only use passwordless phone sign-in for your personal Microsoft account, you don't have to turn on two-factor verification. However, for additional account security, we recommend that you turn on two-factor verification.

### Turn on two-factor verification

1. On your computer, go to your [Security basics](https://account.microsoft.com/security) page and sign-in using your personal Microsoft account. For example, alain@outlook.com.

2. At the bottom of the **Security basics** page, choose the **more security options** link.

3. Go to the **Two-step verification** section and choose to turn the feature **On**. You can also turn it off here if you no longer want to use it with your personal account.

### Add your Microsoft account to the app

1. Open the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device.

2. Select **Add account** from the **Customize and control** icon in the upper right.

4. Sign in to your personal account, using the appropriate email address (such as alain@outlook.com), and then choose **Next**.
