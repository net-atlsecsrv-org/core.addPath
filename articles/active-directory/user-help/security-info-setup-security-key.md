# Set up a security key as your verification method

You can use security keys as a passwordless sign-in method within your organization. A security key is a physical device that's used with a unique PIN to sign-in to your work or school account. Because security keys require you to have the physical device and something only you know, it's considered a stronger verification method than a username and password.

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-preview-notice-security-key.md)]

>[!Note]
> If you don't see the security key option, it's possible that your organization doesn't allow you to use this option for verification. In this case, you'll need to choose another method or contact your organization's help desk for more assistance.

## Security verification versus password reset authentication

Security info methods are used for both two-factor security verification and for password reset. However, not all methods can be used for both.

| Method | Used for |
| ------ | -------- |
| Authenticator app | Two-factor verification and password reset authentication. |
| Text messages | Two-factor verification and password reset authentication. |
| Phone calls | Two-factor verification and password reset authentication. |
| Security key | Two-factor verification and password reset authentication. |
| Email account | Password reset authentication only. You'll need to choose another method for two-factor verification. |
| Security questions | Password reset authentication only. You'll need to choose another method for two-factor verification. |

## What is a security key?

We currently support several designs and providers of security keys using the [Fast Identity Online (FIDO)](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) (FIDO2) passwordless authentication protocols. These keys allow you to sign in to your work or school account to access your organization's cloud-based resources when on a supported device and web browser.

Your administrator or your organization will provide you with a security key if they require it for your work or school account. There are different types of security keys you can use, for example a USB key that you plug in to your device or an NFC key that you tap on an NFC reader. You can find out more information about your security key, including what type it is, from the manufacturer's documentation.

> [!Note]
> If you're unable to use a FIDO2 security key, there are other passwordless verification methods you can use such as the Microsoft Authenticator app or Windows Hello. For more information about the Microsoft Authenticator app, see [What is the Microsoft Authenticator app?](user-help-auth-app-overview.md). For more information about Windows Hello, see [Windows Hello overview](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-hello).

## Before you begin

Before you are able to register your security key, the following must be true:

- Your administrator has turned on this feature for use within your organization.

- You're on a device running the Windows 10 May 2019 Update and using a supported browser.

- You have a physical security key approved by your administrator or your organization. Your security key must be both FIDO2 and Microsoft-compliant. If you have any questions about your security key and whether it's compatible, contact your organization's help desk.

## Register your security key

You must create your security key and give it a unique PIN before you can sign in to your work or school account using the key. You may have up to 10 keys registered with your account. 

1. Go to the **My Profile** page at https://myaccount.microsoft.com and sign in if you haven't already done so.

2. Select **Security Info**, select **Add method**, and then select **Security key** from the **Add a method** drop-down list.

    ![Add method box, with Security key selected](media/security-info/security-info-security-key-add-method.png)

3. Select **Add**, and then select the type of security key you have, either **USB device** or **NFC device**.

    ![Choose whether you have a USB or NFC type of security key](media/security-info/security-info-security-key-choose-type.png)

    > [!Note]
    > If you aren't sure which type of security key you have, refer to the manufacturer's documentation. If you aren't sure about the manufacturer, contact your organization's help desk for assistance.

4. Have your security key physically available and then in the **Security key** box, select **Next**.

    ![Security key start registration box](media/security-info/security-info-security-key-start-setup.png)

    A new box appears to help walk you through setting up your new sign-in method.

5. In the **Setting up your new sign-in method** box, select **Next**, and then:

    - If your security key is a USB device, insert your security key into the USB port of your device.

    - If your security key is an NFC device, tap your security key to your reader.

6. Type your unique security key PIN into the **Windows security** box, and then select **OK**.

    You'll return to the **Setting up your new sign-in method** box.

7. Select **Next**.

8. Return to the **Security info** page, type a name you'll recognize later for your new security key, and then select **Next**.

    ![Security info page, naming your security key](media/security-info/security-info-security-key-name.png)

    Your security key is registered and ready for you to use for sign in to your work or school account.

9. Select **Done** to close the **Security key** box.

    The **Security info** page is updated with your security key information.

## Delete a security key from your security info

If you misplace or no longer want to use a security key, you can delete the key from your security info. While this stops the security key from being used with your work or school account, the security key continues to store your data and credential information. To delete your data and credential information from the security key itself, you must follow the instructions in the [Reset a Microsoft-compatible security key](#reset-your-security-key) section of this article.

1. Select the **Delete** link from the security key to remove.

2. Select **Ok** from the **Delete security key** box.

    Your security key is deleted and you'll no longer be able to use it to sign in to your work or school account.

>[!Important]
>If you delete a security key by mistake, you can register it again using the instructions in the [How to register your security key](#register-your-security-key) section of this article.

## Manage your security key settings from Windows Settings

You can manage your security key settings from the **Windows Settings** app, including resetting your security key and creating a new security key PIN.

### Reset your security key

If you want to delete all the account information stored on your physical security key, you must return the key back to its factory defaults. Resetting your security key deletes everything from the key, allowing you to start over.

     The security key is updated with the new security key PIN for use with your work or school account. If you decide to change your PIN again, you can select the **Change** button.
4. Select **Close** to close the **Manage** screen.

## Additional security info methods

In order to register a security key, you must have at least one additional security verification method registered. See the [Overview section](./security-info-setup-auth-app.md) for more information.
