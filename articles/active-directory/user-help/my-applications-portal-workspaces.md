# Access and use workspaces on the My Apps (preview) portal

Workspaces are different app views you see in the **My Apps** (preview) portal. Apps can be grouped into workspaces by department function or user role, for example. If you don't see any workspaces or categories available, it means that your administrator hasn't set up or shared any with you. Contact your organization's Helpdesk for additional assistance or permissions to see shared workspaces.

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your cloud-based apps in the [Application Management Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/access-panel-workspaces).

## Access apps using workspaces

The list of workspaces in the **My Apps** portal defaults to show one named **All Apps**, which has every app you have access to:

Any other workspace you see in this list was created by your admin and shared with you. You can choose one of those workspaces to see a more scoped set of apps, such as *Support* in the following example:

When you select and view a workspace, you only see the default applications that you have access to.

## Next steps

After you organize your apps into the various categories in the **My Apps** portal, you can:

- Review, update, or revoke permissions granted to applications. For more information, see [Edit or revoke application permissions in the My Apps (preview) portal](my-applications-portal-permissions-saved-accounts.md).
