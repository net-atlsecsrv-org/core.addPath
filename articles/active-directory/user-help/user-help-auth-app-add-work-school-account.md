# Add your work or school account to the Microsoft Authenticator app

If your organization uses two-factor verification, you can set up your work or school account to use the Microsoft Authenticator app as one of the verification methods.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you must download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](user-help-auth-app-download-install.md) article.

## Add your work or school account

1. On your computer, go to the [Additional security verification](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/proofup.aspx?proofup=1) page.

    >[!Note]
    >If you don't see the **Additional security verification** page, it's possible that your administrator has turned on the security info (preview) experience. If that's the case, you should follow the instructions in the [Set up security info to use an authenticator app](security-info-setup-auth-app.md) section. If that's not the case, you will need to contact your organization's Help Desk for assistance. For more information about security info, see [Security info (preview) overview](./security-info-setup-signin.md).

2. Check the box next to **Authenticator app**, and then select **Configure**.

    The **Configure mobile app** page appears.

3. Open the Microsoft Authenticator app, select **Add account** from the **Customize and control** icon in the upper-right, and then select **Work or school account**.

    >[!Note]
    >If this is the first time you're setting up the Microsoft Authenticator app, you might receive a prompt asking whether to allow the app to access your camera (iOS) or to allow the app to take pictures and record video (Android). You must select **Allow** so the authenticator app can access your camera to take a picture of the QR code in the next step. If you don't allow the camera, you can still set up the authenticator app, but you'll need to add the code information manually. For information about how to add the code manually, see [Manually add an account to the app](user-help-auth-app-add-account-manual.md).

4. Use your device's camera to scan the QR code from the **Configure mobile app** screen on your computer, and then choose **Done**.

    >[!Note]
    >If your camera is unable to capture the QR code, you can manually add your account information to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification. For more information and how to do it, see [Manually add your account](user-help-auth-app-add-account-manual.md).

5. Review the **Accounts** screen of the app on your device, to make sure your account is right and that there's an associated six-digit verification code. For additional security, the verification code changes every 30 seconds preventing someone from using a code multiple times.

## Next steps

- After you add your accounts to the app, you can sign in using the Authenticator app on your device. For more information, see [Sign in using the app](user-help-auth-app-sign-in.md).

- For devices running iOS, you can also back up your account credentials and related app settings, such as the order of your accounts, to the cloud. For more information, see [Backup and recover with Microsoft Authenticator app](user-help-auth-app-backup-recovery.md).
