# Manage your connected devices from the My Profile (preview) portal

You can manage the devices you're connected to using your work or school account, disabling any that you no longer own, from the **Devices** page of the **My Profile** portal.

## View your connected devices

2. Select **Devices** from the left navigation pane or select the **Manage devices** link from the **Devices** block.

## Disable a device

You can disable any of your connected devices at any time. This is especially important if a device isn't familiar to you or if a device is lost or stolen. After you disable a device, it can no longer be authenticated by your organization, and will be unable to access any of your organization's resources.

>[!Important]
>If you disable a device by mistake, there's no way to undo it. You'll have to contact your organization's administrator to add the device again.

1. Select **Disable** from the device you want to remove.

2. Select **Yes** to confirm you want to disable the device.

## Next steps

- After viewing your connected devices, you can select to view or manage your [security info](user-help-security-info-overview.md), your [organizations](myprofile-portal-organizations-page.md), or view how your organization [uses your data](myprofile-portal-privacy-page.md).
