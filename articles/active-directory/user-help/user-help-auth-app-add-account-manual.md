# Manually add an account to the app

If your camera is unable to capture the QR code, you can manually add your account information to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification. This works for work or school accounts and non-Microsoft accounts.

The codes provided for your accounts aren't case-sensitive and don't require spaces when added into the Microsoft Authenticator app.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you must download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](user-help-auth-app-download-install.md) article.

## Add your work or school account

1. On your computer, note the **Code** and **Url** information on the **Configure mobile app** page. Keep this page open so you can see the code and URL.
