# Access and use apps on the My Apps portal
You can use your work or school account with the web-based **My Apps** portal, to view and start many of your organization’s cloud-based apps, to update some of your profile and account information, to see your **Groups** information, and to perform **access reviews** for your apps and groups. If you don’t have access to the **My Apps** portal, you must contact your Helpdesk for permission.

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-my-apps-portal.md)]

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your cloud-based apps in the [Application Management Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps).

## Supported browsers
You can get to the **My Apps** portal from any of the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome

- Mozilla Firefox, version 26.0 or later

- Microsoft Edge

- Internet Explorer, version 11 (limited support)

## Download and install the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension
Download and install the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension, if you're prompted. This extension helps you start any of your organization's cloud apps that require you to use a single sign-on process. If your organization has already set you up for single sign-on, the extension is installed automatically and you can skip this section.

This extension helps you: 

- Sign in directly to apps from the sign-in page.

- Start any apps using the **Quick search** feature.

- See the last apps you used in the **Recently Used** section.

- Use internal company URLs while remote with [Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-application-proxy-get-started).

### To download and install the extension
Download and install the extension, based on the browser you're using:

- **Google Chrome.** From the Chrome Web Store, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-apps-secure-sign-in-ex/ggjhpefgjjfobnfoldnjipclpcfbgbhl) feature, and then select **Add to Chrome**.

- **Mozilla Firefox** From the **Firefox Add-ons** page, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/access-panel-extension/) feature, and then select **Add to Firefox**.

- **Microsoft Edge** From the Microsoft Store, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://www.microsoft.com/p/my-apps-secure-sign-in-extension/9pc9sckkzk84?rtc=1&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) feature, and then select **Get**.

An icon is added to the right of your **Address** bar, letting you sign-in and customize the extension.

#### To change your My Apps portal using the extension
You can choose how many apps to view in the **Recently Used** section and decide whether to allow your organization's internal URLs to redirect.

1. Select the new **My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension** icon ![Extension icon](media/my-apps-portal/my-apps-portal-extension-icon.png) to the right of your **Address** bar, and then select **Sign in to get started**.
