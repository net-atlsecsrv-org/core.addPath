[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-my-apps-portal.md)]

> [!Important]
> This content is intended for My Apps users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your cloud-based apps in the [Application Management Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps).

## Supported browsers

You can get to the **My Apps** portal from any of the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome

- Mozilla Firefox, version 26.0 or later

- Microsoft Edge

- Internet Explorer, version 11 (limited support)

## Download and install the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension

Download and install the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension, if you're prompted. This extension helps you start any of your organization's cloud apps that require you to use a single sign-on process. If your organization has already set you up for single sign-on, the extension is installed automatically and you can skip this section.

This extension helps you:

- Sign in directly to apps from the sign-in page.

- Start any apps using the **Quick search** feature.

- See the last apps you used in the **Recently Used** section.

- Use internal company URLs while remote with [Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-application-proxy-get-started).

### To download and install the extension

Download and install the extension, based on the browser you're using:

- **Google Chrome.** From the Chrome Web Store, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-apps-secure-sign-in-ex/ggjhpefgjjfobnfoldnjipclpcfbgbhl) feature, and then select **Add to Chrome**.

- **Mozilla Firefox** From the **Firefox Add-ons** page, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/access-panel-extension/) feature, and then select **Add to Firefox**.

- **Microsoft Edge** From the Microsoft Store, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://www.microsoft.com/p/my-apps-secure-sign-in-extension/9pc9sckkzk84?rtc=1&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) feature, and then select **Get** to get the extension for Microsoft Edge legacy browser.  
If you are using the new Microsoft Edge browser (Edge on Chromium) then you can get the extenion from [Microsoft Edge Addons Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/category/EdgeExtensionsEditorsPick).

An icon is added to the right of your **Address** bar, letting you sign-in and customize the extension.
