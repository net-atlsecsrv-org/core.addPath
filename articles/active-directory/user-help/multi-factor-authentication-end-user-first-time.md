# What is the Additional verification page?

You've gotten an email from someone in IT or your boss saying that the organization has added additional security verification to your account. So what does that mean? It means your organization is taking extra steps to make sure you are who you say you are when you sign in. This extra verification, also known as two-factor verification, is done through a combination of your user name, your password, and a mobile device or phone.

Two-factor verification is more secure than just a password because it relies on two forms of authentication: something you know, and something you have with you. The something you know is your password. The something you have with you is a phone or device that you commonly have with you. Two-factor verification can help to stop malicious hackers from pretending to be you, because even if they have your password, odds are that they don't have your device, too.

>[!Important]
>This article is intended for users trying to use two-factor verification with a work or school account (such as, alain@contoso.com). If you're an administrator looking for information about how to turn on two-factor verification for your employees or other users, see the [Azure Active Directory Authentication documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/).

## Who decides if you use this feature?

Depending on your account type, your organization might decide that you must use two-factor verification, or you might be able to decide for yourself.

- **Work or school account.** If you're using a work or school account (for example, alain@contoso.com), it's up to your organization whether you must use two-factor verification, along with the specific verification methods. Because your organization has decided you must use this feature, there is no way for you to individually turn it off.

- **Personal Microsoft account.** You can choose to set up two-factor verification for your personal Microsoft accounts (for example, alain@outlook.com). If you're having problems with two-factor verification and your personal Microsoft account, see [Turning two-factor verification on or off for your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028586/microsoft-account-turning-two-step-verification-on-or-off). Because you choose whether to use this feature, you can turn it on and off whenever you want.

    >[!Note]
    >If you're having problems with two-factor verification and one of your personal Microsoft accounts (for example, danielle@outlook.com), you can try the suggestions on the [How to use two-step verification with your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12408/microsoft-account-how-to-use-two-step-verification).

## Access the Additional security verification page

After your organization turns on and sets up two-factor verification, youâ€™ll get a prompt telling you to provide more information to help keep your account secure.
