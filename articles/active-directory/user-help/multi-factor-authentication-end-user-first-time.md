# Set up your two-factor verification methods overview

Your organization has turned on two-factor verification, meaning that your work or school account sign-in now requires a combination of your username, your password, and a mobile device or phone. Your organization turned on this extra verification because it's more secure than just a password, relying on two forms of authentication: something you know and something you have with you. Two-factor verification can help to prevent malicious hackers from pretending to be you, because even if they have your password, odds are that they don't have your device, too.

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

## Who decides if you use this feature?

Depending on your account type, your organization might decide that you must use two-factor verification, or you might be able to decide for yourself.

- **Work or school account.** If you're using a work or school account (for example, alain@contoso.com), it's up to your organization whether you must use two-factor verification, along with the specific verification methods. Because your organization has decided you must use this feature, there is no way for you to individually turn it off.

- **Personal Microsoft account.** You can choose to set up two-factor verification for your personal Microsoft accounts (for example, alain@outlook.com). If you're having problems with two-factor verification and your personal Microsoft account, see [Turning two-factor verification on or off for your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028586/microsoft-account-turning-two-step-verification-on-or-off). Because you choose whether to use this feature, you can turn it on and off whenever you want.

## Access the Additional security verification page

After your organization turns on and sets up two-factor verification, youâ€™ll get a prompt telling you to provide more information to help keep your account secure.
