# Manage your organizations from the My Profile (preview) portal
You can manage your organizations from the **Organizations** page of the **My Profile** portal.

There are two types of organizations shown on the **Organizations** page:

- **Home organization.** Your home organization is the organization that owns your work or school account. You can't leave your home organization.

- **Other organizations.** The other organizations are any group that you've signed in to previously using your work or school account. You can leave any of these organizations at any time.

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-preview-notice-myprofile.md)]

## View your organizations
1. Sign in to your work or school account and then go to your https://myprofile.microsoft.com/ page.

2. Select **Organizations** from the left navigation pane or select the **Manage organizations** link from the **Organizations** block.
