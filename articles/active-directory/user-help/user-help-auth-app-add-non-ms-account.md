# Add non-Microsoft accounts to the Microsoft Authenticator app

Add your non-Microsoft accounts, such as for Google, Facebook, or GitHub to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification. The Microsoft Authenticator app works with any app that uses two-factor verification and any account that supports the time-based one-time password (TOTP) standards.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you must download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](user-help-auth-app-download-install.md) article.

## Add personal accounts

Generally, for all your personal accounts, you must:

1. Sign in to your account, and then turn on two-factor verification using either your device or your computer.

2. Add the account to the Microsoft Authenticator app. You might be asked to scan a QR code as part of this process.

    >[!Note]
    >If this is the first time you're setting up the Microsoft Authenticator app, you might receive a prompt asking whether to allow the app to access your camera (iOS) or to allow the app to take pictures and record video (Android). You must select **Allow** so the authenticator app can access your camera to take a picture of the QR code in the next step. If you don't allow the camera, you can still set up the authenticator app, but you'll need to add the code information manually. For information about how to add the code manually, see see [Manually add an account to the app](user-help-auth-app-add-account-manual.md).

We're providing the process here for your Facebook, Google, GitHub, and Amazon accounts, but this process is the same for any other app, such as Instagram, Netflix, or Adobe.

## Add your Google account

Add your Google account by turning on two-factor verification and then adding the account to the app.

### Turn on two-factor verification

1. On your computer, go to https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome, select **Get Started**, and then verify your identity.

2. On the **Get codes from the Authenticator app** page, select either **Android** or **iPhone** based on your phone type, and then select **Next**.

4. Use your device's camera to scan the QR code from the **Set up Authenticator** page on your computer.

    >[!Note]
    >If your camera isn't working properly, you can enter the QR code and URL manually.

5. Review the **Accounts** page of the Microsoft Authenticator app on your device, to make sure your account information is right and that there's an associated six-digit verification code.

    For additional security, the verification code changes every 30 seconds preventing someone from using a code multiple times.
