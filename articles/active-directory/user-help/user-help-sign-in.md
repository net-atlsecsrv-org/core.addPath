> 
> If your administrator has turned on the security info experience, you'll need to set your authentication methods using these step-by-step articles:<ul><li>[Set up security info to use an authentication app](security-info-setup-auth-app.md)</li><li>[Set up security info to use text messaging](security-info-setup-text-msg.md)</li><li>[Set up security info to use a phone call](security-info-setup-phone-number.md)</li></ul>

    >[!Note]
    >If you don't see the **Sign in another way** link, it means that you haven't set up any other verification methods and that you'll have to contact your administrator for help signing into your account. After your administrator helps you to sign in, make sure you add additional verification methods. For more info about adding verification methods, see the [Manage your settings for two-step verification](multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings.md) article.
