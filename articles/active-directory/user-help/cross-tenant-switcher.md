# Switching organizations in a portal

In your account or access portals, such as the **My Account** portal for your organizational accounts, you can switch to other organizations you might work with to manage your account information in those other organizations.

The organization switcher is available in the following portals:

- [**My Account**](https://myaccount.microsoft.com)
- [**My Apps**](https://myapps.microsoft.com)
- [**My Access**](https://myaccess.microsoft.com)
- [**My Staff**](https://mystaff.microsoft.com)

Switching organizations is not available for **My Sign-ins**, **Security info**, or **My Groups**.

## Switch organizations

Here's how to switch to another organization. This example uses the **My Account** portal, but the switcher icon and placement are similar in other portals, too.

1. Sign in to your work or school account, and then open the [My Account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com) page.
1. Select the organization switcher :::image type="content" source="media/cross-tenant-switcher/switcher-icon.png" alt-text="The icon for the organization switcher"::: at the top of the page, next to your account photo.

1. Select the organization to which you would like to switch. You'll automatically be switched to the organization you selected.

If the organization you selected has additional security requirements, you might be prompted to provide an additional piece of security information.

## After switching

After you switch organizations, all portal pages will reflect the organization you selected.

> [!Important]
>The password you use to sign in to your home organization is the one used to sign you in to other organizations. Please be aware that:
>
>- If you're signed in to an organization that isn't your home organization and then select **Password** on the **My Account** Overview page or other places where it appears, you are immediately switched back to your home organization.
>- In the **My Staff** portal, if you switch to another organization, you'll only have access to My Staff if you are enabled for My Staff in that organization.
