# Configure Azure Active Directory to meet identity standards

In today's world of interconnected infrastructures, compliance with governmental and industry frameworks and standards is often mandatory. 

Compliance frameworks can be extremely complex. Microsoft engages with governments, regulators, and standards bodies to understand and meet compliance needs in its Azure platform. You can take advantage of more than [90 Azure compliance certifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance). Our compliance offerings include many specific to global regions and countries. Azure also offers 35 compliance offerings specific to key industries, including health, government, finance, education, manufacturing, and media. 

## Azure compliance provides a head start

Compliance is a shared responsibility among Microsoft, Cloud service providers (CSPs), and organizations. You can rely on Azure's compliance certifications as a basis for your compliance, and then configure Azure Active Directory to meet identity standards.

Cloud service providers (CSPs), governmental agencies, and those who work with them must often meet stringent standards for one or more governments such as
* [US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fedramp)
* [National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-nist-800-53).

CSPs and organizations in industries such as healthcare and finance must also meet industry standards such as 
* [HIPPA](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-hipaa-us)
* [Sorbanes-Oxley (Sox)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-sox-us).

To learn more about supported compliance frameworks, see [Azure compliance offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/).
