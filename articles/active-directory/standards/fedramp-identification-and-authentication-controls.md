If your organization is completely cloud-based, we recommend using FIDO2 security keys or Windows Hello for Business.<p>FIDO2 keys and Windows Hello for Business have not been validated at the required FIPS 140 Security Level and as such federal customers would need to conduct risk assessment and evaluation before accepting these authenticators as AAL3. For additional details regarding FIDO2 and Windows Hello for Business FIPS 140 validation please refer to [Microsoft NIST AALs](nist-overview.md).<p>Guidance regarding MDM polices differ slightly based on authentication methods, they are broken out below. <p>Smart Card / Windows Hello for Business<br> [Passwordless Strategy - Require Windows Hello for Business or smart card](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)<br> [Require device to be marked as compliant](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md)<br> [Conditional Access - Require MFA for all users](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)<p> Hybrid Only<br> [Passwordless Strategy - Configure user accounts to disallow password authentication](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)<p> Smart Card Only<br>[Create a Rule to Send an Authentication Method Claim](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-rule-to-send-an-authentication-method-claim)<br>[Configure Authentication Policies](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies)<p>FIDO2 Security Key<br> [Passwordless Strategy - Excluding the password credential provider](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)<br> [Require device to be marked as compliant](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md)<br> [Conditional Access - Require MFA for all users](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)<p>Authentication Methods<br> [Azure Active Directory passwordless sign-in (preview) | FIDO2 security keys](../authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless.md)<br> [Passwordless security key sign-in Windows - Azure Active Directory](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key-windows.md)<br> [ADFS: Certificate Authentication with Azure AD & Office 365](/archive/blogs/samueld/adfs-certauth-aad-o365)<br> [How Smart Card Sign-in Works in Windows (Windows 10)](/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-how-smart-card-sign-in-works-in-windows)<br> [Windows Hello for Business Overview (Windows 10)](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview)<p>Additional Resources:<br> [Policy CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider)<br> [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](/mem/intune/apps/intune-management-extension)<br> [Plan a passwordless authentication deployment with Azure AD](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment.md)<br> |

All Azure AD authentication methods at Authentication Assurance Level 2 & 3 use either nonce or challenges and are resistant to replay attacks.p>References:<br> [Conditional Access - Require MFA for all users](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)<br> [Achieving National Institute of Standards and Technology Authenticator Assurance Levels with the Microsoft Identity Platform.](nist-overview.md) |
| IA-02(11)| **Implement Azure multi-factor authentication to access customer-deployed resources remotely such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access where the device meets FIPS-140-2, NIAP Certification, or NSA approval**<p>See guidance for IA-02(1-4). Azure AD authentication methods to consider at AAL3 meeting the separate device requirements are:<p> FIDO2 Security Keys<br> Windows Hello for Business with Hardware TPM (TPM is recognized as a valid "something you have" factor by NIST 800-63B Section 5.1.7.1)<br> Smart Card<p>References:<br>[Achieving National Institute of Standards and Technology Authenticator Assurance Levels with the Microsoft Identity Platform.](nist-overview.md)<br> [NIST 800-63B Section 5.1.7.1](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) |
| IA-02(12)| **Accept and verify Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials. This control is not applicable if the customer does not deploy PIV credentials.**<p>Configure federated authentication using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to accept PIV (certificate authentication) as both primary and multi-factor authentication methods and issue the MFA (MultipleAuthN) claim when PIV is used. Configure the federated domain in Azure AD with SupportsMFA to direct MFA requests originating at Azure AD to the ADFS. Alternatively, PIV can be used for sign-in on Windows devices and subsequently leverage Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) along with Seamless Single Sign-On (SSSO). Windows Server & Client verify certificates by default when used for authentication. <p> [What is federation with Azure AD?](../hybrid/whatis-fed.md)<br> [Configure AD FS support for user certificate authentication](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication)[Configure AD FS support for user certificate authentication](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication)<br> [Configure Authentication Policies](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies)[Configure Authentication Policies](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies)<br> [Secure resources with Azure AD MFA and ADFS](../authentication/howto-mfa-adfs.md)<br>[Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldomainfederationsettings)<br> [Azure AD Connect: Seamless Single Sign-On](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sso.md) |

Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual (e.g., contractors, foreign nationals, etc.).**<p>Assign and manage individual account identifiers and status in Azure AD in accordance with existing organizational policies defined in AC-02. Follow AC-02(3) to automatically disable user and device accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Ensure that organizational policy maintains all accounts that remain in the disabled state for at least 2 years after which they can be removed. <p>Determine Inactivity<br> [How to manage inactive user accounts in Azure AD](../reports-monitoring/howto-manage-inactive-user-accounts.md)<br> [How to manage stale devices in Azure AD](../devices/manage-stale-devices.md)[How to manage stale devices in Azure AD](../devices/manage-stale-devices.md)<br> [See AC-02 guidance](fedramp-access-controls.md) |
| IA-05| **Configure and manage information system authenticators.**<p>Azure AD supports a wide variety of authentication methods and can be managed using your existing organizational policies. See guidance for authenticator selection in IA-02(1-4). Enable users in combined registration for SSPR and Azure AD MFA and require users to register a minimum of two acceptable multi-factor authentication methods to facilitate self-remediation. Administrators can revoke user configured authenticators at any time with the authentication methods API. <p>Authenticator Strength/Protect Authenticator Content<br> [Achieving National Institute of Standards and Technology Authenticator Assurance Levels with the Microsoft Identity Platform.](nist-overview.md)<p>Authentication Methods & Combined Registration<br> [What authentication and verification methods are available in Azure Active Directory?](../authentication/concept-authentication-methods.md)<br> [Combined registration for SSPR and Azure AD multi-factor authentication](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md)<p>Authenticator Revoke<br> [Azure AD authentication methods API overview](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethods-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) |
| IA-05(1)| **Implement password-based authentication requirements.**<p>Per NIST SP 800-63B Section 5.1.1: Maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords.<p>With Azure AD Password Protection, default global banned password lists are automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant. To support your own business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.<p>Microsoft strongly encourages passwordless strategies. This control is only applicable to password authenticators. Therefore, removing passwords as an available authenticator renders this control not applicable.<p>NIST Reference Documents:<br>[NIST Special Publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)<br>[NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) - IA-5 - Control Enhancement (1)<p>Additional Resources:<br>[Eliminate bad passwords using Azure Active Directory Password Protection](../authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md) |
| IA-05(2)| **Implement PKI-Based authentication requirements.**<p>Federate Azure AD via ADFS to implement PKI-based authentication. By default, ADFS validates certificates, locally caches revocation data and maps users to the authenticated identity in Active Directory. <p> Additional Resources:<br> [What is federation with Azure AD?](../hybrid/whatis-fed.md)<br> [Configure AD FS support for user certificate authentication](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication) |
| IA-05(4)| **Employ automated tools to validate password strength requirements.** <p>Azure AD implements automated mechanisms which enforce password authenticator strength at creation. This automated mechanism can also be extended to enforce password authenticator strength for on-premises Active Directory. Revision 5 of NIST 800-53 has withdrawn IA-04(4) and incorporated the requirement into IA-5(1).<p>Additional Resources:<p> [Eliminate bad passwords using Azure Active Directory Password Protection](../authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md)<br> [Azure AD Password Protection for Active Directory Domain Services](../authentication/concept-password-ban-bad-on-premises.md)<br>[NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) - IA-5 - Control Enhancement (4) |

| IA-05(13)| **Enforce the expiration of cached authenticators.**<p>Cached authenticators are used to authenticate to the local machine when the network is not available. To limit the use of cached authenticators, configure Windows devices to disable their use. Where this is not possible or practical, use the following compensating controls:<p>Configure conditional access session controls using application enforced restrictions for Office applications.<br> Configure conditional access using application controls for other applications.<p>Resources:<br> [Interactive logon Number of previous logons to cache](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available)<br> [Session controls in Conditional Access policy - Application enforced restrictions](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session.md)<br>[Session controls in Conditional Access policy - Conditional Access application control](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session.md) |
| IA-06| **Obscure authentication feedback information during the authentication process.**<p>By default, Azure AD obscures all authenticator feedback. <p>
| IA-07| **Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meets applicable federal laws.**<p>FedRAMP High requires AAL3 authenticator. All authenticators supported by Azure AD at AAL3 provide mechanisms to authenticate operator access to the module as required. For example, in a Windows Hello for Business deployment with hardware TPM, configure the level of TPM owner authorization.<p> Resources:<br>See IA-02(2 & 4) for additional detail.
