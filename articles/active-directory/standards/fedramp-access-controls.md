# Configure identity access controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

Access control is a major part of achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Authority to operate.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the Access Control family may require configuration in your Azure AD tenant. 


|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| AC-02| Account management |
| AC-06| Least privilege |
| AC-07| Unsuccessful logon attempts |
| AC-08| System use notification |
| AC-10| Concurrent session control |
| AC-11| Session lock |
| AC-12| Session termination |
| AC-20| Use of external information systems |


Each row in the table below provides prescriptive guidance to aid you in developing your organization's response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.
 
## Configurations


| Control ID   | Customer responsibilities and guidance |
| - | - |
| AC-02   | **Implement account lifecycle management for customer-controlled accounts. Monitor the use of accounts and notify account managers of account lifecycle events. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements every month for privileged access and every six (6) months for non-privileged access**.<p>Use Azure AD to provision accounts from external HR systems, on-premises Active Directory, or directly in the cloud. All account lifecycle operations are audited within the Azure AD audit logs. Logs can be collected and analyzed by a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution such as Azure Sentinel. Alternatively, you can use Azure Event Hub to integrate logs with third-party SIEM solutions to enable monitoring and notification. Use Azure AD entitlement management with access reviews to ensure compliance status of accounts.<p>Provision accounts<br>[Plan cloud HR application to Azure Active Directory user provisioning](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision)<br>[Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis)<br>[Add or delete users - Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory)<p>Monitor accounts<br>[Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs)<br>[Connect Azure Active Directory data to Azure Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory) <br>[Tutorial - Stream logs to an Azure event hub](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub)<p>Review accounts<br>[What is entitlement management? - Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview)<br>[Create an access review of an access package in Azure AD entitlement management ](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-reviews-create)<br>[Review access of an access package in Azure AD entitlement management](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-reviews-review-access)<p>Resources:<br>[Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference)<br>[Dynamic Groups in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-create-rule) |
| AC-02(1)| **Employ automated mechanisms to support management of customer-controlled accounts.**<p>Configure automated provisioning of customer-controlled accounts from external HR systems or on-premises Active Directory. For applications that support application provisioning, configure Azure AD to automatically create user identities and roles in cloud (SaaS) applications that users need access to. In addition to creating user identities, automatic provisioning includes the maintenance and removal of user identities as status or roles change. Ease monitoring of account usage by streaming Identity Protection logs (risky users, risky sign-ins, and risk detections) and audit logs directly into Azure Sentinel or Azure Event Hub.<p>Provision<br>[Plan cloud HR application to Azure Active Directory user provisioning](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision)<br>[Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis)<br>[What is automated SaaS app user provisioning in Azure AD?](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/user-provisioning)<br>[SaaS App Integration Tutorials for use with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list)<p>Monitor & Audit<br>[How To: Investigate risk](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk)<br>[Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs)<br>[What is Azure Sentinel?](/azure/sentinel/overview)<br>[Azure Sentinel: Connect data from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory)<br>[Stream Azure Active Directory logs to an Azure event hub](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub)â€Ž|

| AC-02(5)| **Implement device log out after a 15-minute period of inactivity**.<p>Implement device lock using a Conditional Access policy that restricts access to compliant devices. Configure policy settings on the device to enforce device lock at the OS level with MDM solutions such as Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) or group policy objects (GPO) can also be considered in hybrid deployments.
