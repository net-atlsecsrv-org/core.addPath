# What is Azure AD Connect cloud provisioning?
Azure AD Connect cloud provisioning is a new Microsoft agent designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals for synchronization of users, groups and contacts to Azure AD.  It can be used alongside Azure AD Connect sync, and provides the following benefits:
    
- Support for synchronizing to an Azure AD tenant from a multi-forest disconnected Active Directory forest environment: The common scenarios include merger & acquisition, where the acquired company's AD forests are isolated from the parent company's AD forests and companies that have historically had multiple AD forests.
- Simplified installation with light-weight provisioning agents: The agents act as a bridge from AD to Azure AD, with all the sync configuration managed in the cloud. 
- Multiple provisioning agents can be used to simplify high availability deployments, particularly critical for organizations relying upon password hash synchronization from AD to Azure AD.

## How is Azure AD Connect cloud provisioning different from Azure AD Connect sync?
With Azure AD Connect cloud provisioning, provisioning from AD to Azure AD is orchestrated in Microsoft Online Services. An organization only needs to deploy, in their on-premises and IaaS-hosted environment, a lightweight agent that acts as a bridge between Azure AD and AD. The provisioning configuration is stored in Azure AD and managed as part of the service.
