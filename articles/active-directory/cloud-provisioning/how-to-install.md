### Verify the port
To verify the Azure is listening on port 443 and that your agent can communicate with it, you can use the following:

https://aadap-portcheck.connectorporttest.msappproxy.net/ 

This test will verify that your agents are able to communicate with Azure over port 443.  Open a browser and navigate to the above URL from the server where the agent is installed.

### On the local server
To verify that the agent is running follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the server with an administrator account
2.  Open **Services** by either navigating to it or by going to Start/Run/Services.msc.
3.  Under **Services** make sure **Microsoft Azure AD Connect Agent Updater** and **Microsoft Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent** are there and the status is **Running**.
