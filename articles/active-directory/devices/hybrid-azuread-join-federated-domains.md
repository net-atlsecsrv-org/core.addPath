# Tutorial: Configure hybrid Azure Active Directory join for federated domains

Like a user in your organization, a device is a core identity you want to protect. You can use a device's identity to protect your resources at any time and from any location. You can accomplish this goal by bringing device identities and managing them in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using one of the following methods:

- Azure AD join
- Hybrid Azure AD join
- Azure AD registration

Bringing your devices to Azure AD maximizes user productivity through single sign-on (SSO) across your cloud and on-premises resources. You can secure access to your cloud and on-premises resources with [Conditional Access](../active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md) at the same time.

A federated environment should have an identity provider that supports the following requirements. If you have a federated environment using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), then the below requirements are already supported.

- **WIAORMULTIAUTHN claim:** This claim is required to do hybrid Azure AD join for Windows down-level devices.
- **WS-Trust protocol:** This protocol is required to authenticate Windows current hybrid Azure AD joined devices with Azure AD.
  When you're using AD FS, you need to enable the following WS-Trust endpoints: 
   `/adfs/services/trust/2005/windowstransport`
   `/adfs/services/trust/13/windowstransport`
   `/adfs/services/trust/2005/usernamemixed`
   `/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed`
   `/adfs/services/trust/2005/certificatemixed`
   `/adfs/services/trust/13/certificatemixed` 

> [!WARNING] 
> Both **adfs/services/trust/2005/windowstransport** and **adfs/services/trust/13/windowstransport** should be enabled as intranet facing endpoints only and must NOT be exposed as extranet facing endpoints through the Web Application Proxy. To learn more on how to disable WS-Trust Windows endpoints, see [Disable WS-Trust Windows endpoints on the proxy](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#disable-ws-trust-windows-endpoints-on-the-proxy-ie-from-extranet). You can see what endpoints are enabled through the AD FS management console under **Service** > **Endpoints**.

In this tutorial, you learn how to configure hybrid Azure AD join for Active Directory domain-joined computers devices in a federated environment by using AD FS.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you're familiar with these articles:

- [What is a device identity?](overview.md)
- [How to plan your hybrid Azure AD join implementation](hybrid-azuread-join-plan.md)
- [How to do controlled validation of hybrid Azure AD join](hybrid-azuread-join-control.md)

To configure the scenario in this tutorial, you need:

- Windows Server 2012 R2 with AD FS
- [Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) version 1.1.819.0 or later

Beginning with version 1.1.819.0, Azure AD Connect includes a wizard that you can use to configure hybrid Azure AD join. The wizard significantly simplifies the configuration process. The related wizard:

- Configures the service connection points (SCPs) for device registration
- Backs up your existing Azure AD relying party trust
- Updates the claim rules in your Azure AD trust

The configuration steps in this article are based on using the Azure AD Connect wizard. If you have an earlier version of Azure AD Connect installed, you must upgrade it to 1.1.819 or later to use the wizard. If installing the latest version of Azure AD Connect isn't an option for you, see [how to manually configure hybrid Azure AD join](hybrid-azuread-join-manual.md).

Hybrid Azure AD join requires devices to have access to the following Microsoft resources from inside your organization's network:  

- `https://enterpriseregistration.windows.net`
- `https://login.microsoftonline.com`
- `https://device.login.microsoftonline.com`
- Your organization's Security Token Service (STS) (For federated domains)
- `https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com` (If you use or plan to use seamless SSO)

Beginning with Windows 10 1803, if the instantaneous hybrid Azure AD join for a federated environment by using AD FS fails, we rely on Azure AD Connect to sync the computer object in Azure AD that's subsequently used to complete the device registration for hybrid Azure AD join. Verify that Azure AD Connect has synced the computer objects of the devices you want to be hybrid Azure AD joined to Azure AD. If the computer objects belong to specific organizational units (OUs), you must also configure the OUs to sync in Azure AD Connect. To learn more about how to sync computer objects by using Azure AD Connect, see [Configure filtering by using Azure AD Connect](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering.md#organizational-unitbased-filtering).

If your organization requires access to the internet via an outbound proxy, Microsoft recommends [implementing Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD)](/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc995261(v%3dtechnet.10)) to enable Windows 10 computers for device registration with Azure AD. If you encounter issues configuring and managing WPAD, see [Troubleshoot automatic detection](/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc302643(v=technet.10)). 

If you don't use WPAD and want to configure proxy settings on your computer, you can do so beginning with Windows 10 1709. For more information, see [Configure WinHTTP settings by using a group policy object (GPO)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/netgeeks/2018/06/19/winhttp-proxy-settings-deployed-by-gpo/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure proxy settings on your computer by using WinHTTP settings, any computers that can't connect to the configured proxy will fail to connect to the internet.

If your organization requires access to the internet via an authenticated outbound proxy, you must make sure that your Windows 10 computers can successfully authenticate to the outbound proxy. Because Windows 10 computers run device registration by using machine context, you must configure outbound proxy authentication by using machine context. Follow up with your outbound proxy provider on the configuration requirements.

To verify if the device is able to access the above Microsoft resources under the system account, you can use [Test Device Registration Connectivity](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Test-Device-Registration-3dc944c0) script.

## Enable Windows downlevel devices

If some of your domain-joined devices are Windows downlevel devices, you must:

- Configure the local intranet settings for device registration
- Install Microsoft Workplace Join for Windows downlevel computers

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 7 support ended on January 14, 2020. For more information, [Support for Windows 7 has ended](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057281/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020).

### Configure the local intranet settings for device registration

To successfully complete hybrid Azure AD join of your Windows downlevel devices and to avoid certificate prompts when devices authenticate to Azure AD, you can push a policy to your domain-joined devices to add the following URLs to the local intranet zone in Internet Explorer:

- `https://device.login.microsoftonline.com`
- Your organization's STS (For federated domains)
- `https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com` (For seamless SSO)

You also must enable **Allow updates to status bar via script** in the user’s local intranet zone.

### Install Microsoft Workplace Join for Windows downlevel computers

To register Windows downlevel devices, organizations must install [Microsoft Workplace Join for non-Windows 10 computers](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53554). Microsoft Workplace Join for non-Windows 10 computers is available in the Microsoft Download Center.

You can deploy the package by using a software distribution system like [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](/configmgr/). The package supports the standard silent installation options with the `quiet` parameter. The current branch of Configuration Manager offers benefits over earlier versions, like the ability to track completed registrations.

The installer creates a scheduled task on the system that runs in the user context. The task is triggered when the user signs in to Windows. The task silently joins the device with Azure AD by using the user credentials after it authenticates with Azure AD.

## Verify the registration

To verify the device registration state in your Azure tenant, you can use the **[Get-MsolDevice](/powershell/msonline/v1/get-msoldevice)** cmdlet in the [Azure Active Directory PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-msonlinev1?view=azureadps-2.0).

When you use the **Get-MSolDevice** cmdlet to check the service details:

- An object with the **device ID** that matches the ID on the Windows client must exist.
- The value for **DeviceTrustType** must be **Domain Joined**. This setting is equivalent to the **Hybrid Azure AD joined** state under **Devices** in the Azure AD portal.
- For devices that are used in Conditional Access, the value for **Enabled** must be **True** and **DeviceTrustLevel** must be **Managed**.

**To check the service details**:

1. Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
1. Enter `Connect-MsolService` to connect to your Azure tenant.  
1. Enter `get-msoldevice -deviceId <deviceId>`.
1. Verify that **Enabled** is set to **True**.
