# Windows 10 roaming settings reference

The following is a list of the settings that will be roamed or backed up in Windows 10. 

## Devices and endpoints

See the following table for a summary of the devices and account types that are supported by the sync, backup, and restore framework in Windows 10.

| Account type and operation | Desktop | Mobile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Active Directory: sync |Yes |No |
| Azure Active Directory: backup/restore |No |No |
| Microsoft account: sync |Yes |Yes |
| Microsoft account: backup/restore |No |Yes |

## What is backup?

Windows settings generally sync by default, but some settings are only backed up, such as the list of installed applications on a device. Backup is for mobile devices only and currently not available for Enterprise State Roaming users. Backup uses a Microsoft account and stores the settings and application data into OneDrive. If a user disables sync on the device using the Settings app, application data that normally syncs becomes backup only. Backup data can only be accessed through the restore operation during the first run experience of a new device. Backups can be disabled via the device settings, and can be managed and deleted through the userâ€™s OneDrive account.

## Windows Settings overview

The following settings groups are available for end users to enable/disable settings sync on Windows 10 devices.

* Theme: desktop background, user tile, taskbar position, etc. 
* Internet Explorer Settings: browsing history, typed URLs, favorites, etc. 
* Passwords: Windows credential manager, including Wi-Fi profiles 
* Language Preferences: spelling dictionary, system language settings 
* Ease of Access: narrator, on-screen keyboard, magnifier 
* Other Windows Settings: see Windows Settings details
* Microsoft Edge browser setting: Microsoft Edge favorites, reading list, and other settings

## Windows Settings details

In the following table, Other entries in the Settings Group column refer to settings that can be disabled by going to Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings > Other Windows settings. 

Internal entries in the Settings Group column refer to settings and apps that can only be disabled from syncing within the app itself or by disabling sync for the entire device using mobile device management (MDM) or Group Policy settings.
