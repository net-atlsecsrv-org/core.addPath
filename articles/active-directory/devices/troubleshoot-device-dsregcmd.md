# Troubleshooting devices using the dsregcmd command

The dsregcmd /status utility must be run as a domain user account.

## Device state

This section lists the device join state parameters. The table below lists the criteria for the device to be in various join states.

| AzureAdJoined | EnterpriseJoined | DomainJoined | Device state |
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| YES | NO | NO | Azure AD Joined |
| NO | NO | YES | Domain Joined |
| YES | NO | YES | Hybrid AD Joined |
| NO | YES | YES | On-premises DRS Joined |

> [!NOTE]
> Workplace Join (Azure AD registered) state is displayed in the "User State" section

- **AzureAdJoined:** - Set to “YES” if the device is Joined to Azure AD. “NO” otherwise.
- **EnterpriseJoined:** - Set to “YES” if the device is Joined to an on-premises DRS. A device cannot be both EnterpriseJoined and AzureAdJoined.
- **DomainJoined:** - Set to “YES” if the device is joined to a domain (AD).
- **DomainName:** - Set to the name of the domain if the device is joined to a domain.

## Tenant details

Displayed only when the device is Azure AD joined or hybrid Azure AD joined (not Azure AD registered). This section lists the common tenant details when a device is joined to Azure AD.

> [!NOTE]
> If the MDM URLs in this section are empty, it indicates that the MDM was either not configured or current user is not in scope of MDM enrollment. Check the Mobility settings in Azure AD to review your MDM configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if you see MDM URLs this does not mean that the device is managed by an MDM. The information is displayed if the tenant has MDM configuration for auto-enrollment even if the device itself is not managed.

## Diagnostic data

### Pre-join diagnostics

This section is displayed only if the device is domain joined and is unable to hybrid Azure AD join.

This section performs various tests to help diagnose join failures. This section also includes the details of the previous (?). This information includes the error phase, the error code, the server request ID, server response http status, server response error message.

- **User Context:** - The context in which the diagnostics are run. Possible values: SYSTEM, UN-ELEVATED User, ELEVATED User. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Since the actual join is performed in SYSTEM context, running the diagnostics in SYSTEM context is closest to the actual join scenario. To run diagnostics in SYSTEM context, the dsregcmd /status command must be run from an elevated command prompt.

- **Client Time:** - The system time in UTC.
- **AD Connectivity Test:** - Test performs a connectivity test to the domain controller. Error in this test will likely result in Join errors in pre-check phase.
- **AD Configuration Test:** - Test reads and verifies whether the SCP object is configured properly in the on-premises AD forest. Errors in this test would likely result in Join errors in the discover phase with the error code 0x801c001d.
- **DRS Discovery Test:** - Test gets the DRS endpoints from discovery metadata endpoint and performs a user realm request. Errors in this test would likely result in Join errors in the discover phase.
- **DRS Connectivity Test:** - Test performs basic connectivity test to the DRS endpoint.
- **Token acquisition Test:** - Test tries to get an Azure AD authentication token if the user tenant is federated. Errors in this test would likely result in Join errors in the auth phase. If auth fails sync join will be attempted as fallback, unless fallback is explicitly disabled with the below registry key settings.
```
    Keyname: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CDJ
    Value: FallbackToSyncJoin
    Type:  REG_DWORD
    Value: 0x0 -> Disabled
    Value: 0x1 -> Enabled
    Default (No Key): Enabled
 ```
- **Fallback to Sync-Join:** - Set to “Enabled” if the above registry key, to prevent the fallback to sync join with auth failures, is NOT present. This option is available from Windows 10 1803 and later.
- **Previous Registration:** - Time the previous Join attempt occurred. Only failed Join attempts are logged.
- **Error Phase:** - The stage of the join in which it was aborted. Possible values are pre-check, discover, auth, join.
- **Client ErrorCode:** - Client error code returned (HRESULT).
- **Server ErrorCode:** - Server error code if a request was sent to the server and server responded back with an error code. 
- **Server Message:** - Server message returned along with the error code.
- **Https Status:** - Http status returned by the server.
- **Request ID:** - The client requestId sent to the server. Useful to correlate with server-side logs.

### Sample pre-join diagnostics output

The following example shows diagnostics test failing with a discovery error.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Diagnostic Data                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

     Diagnostics Reference : www.microsoft.com/aadjerrors
              User Context : SYSTEM
               Client Time : 2019-01-31 09:25:31.000 UTC
      AD Connectivity Test : PASS
     AD Configuration Test : PASS
        DRS Discovery Test : FAIL [0x801c0021/0x801c000c]
     DRS Connectivity Test : SKIPPED
    Token acquisition Test : SKIPPED
     Fallback to Sync-Join : ENABLED

     Previous Registration : 2019-01-31 09:23:30.000 UTC
               Error Phase : discover
          Client ErrorCode : 0x801c0021

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The following example shows diagnostics tests are passing but the registration attempt failed with a directory error, which is expected for sync join. Once the Azure AD Connect synchronization job completes, the device will be able to join.

```

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Post-join diagnostics

This section displays the output of sanity checks performed on a device joined to the cloud.

- **AadRecoveryEnabled:** - If “YES”, the keys stored in the device are not usable and the device is marked for recovery. The next sign in will trigger the recovery flow and re-register the device.
- **KeySignTest:** - If “PASSED” the device keys are in good health. If KeySignTest fails, the device will usually be marked for recovery. The next sign in will trigger the recovery flow and re-register the device. For hybrid Azure AD joined devices the recovery is silent. While Azure AD joined or Azure AD registered, devices will prompt for user authentication to recover and re-register the device if necessary. **The KeySignTest requires elevated privileges.**

#### Sample post-join diagnostics output

         AadRecoveryEnabled: NO
               KeySignTest : PASSED
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## NGC prerequisite check

This section performs the perquisite checks for the provisioning of Windows Hello for Business (WHFB). 

> [!NOTE]
> You may not see NGC pre-requisite check details in dsregcmd /status if the user already successfully configured WHFB.

- **IsDeviceJoined:** - Set to “YES” if the device is joined to Azure AD.
- **IsUserAzureAD:** - Set to “YES” if the logged in user is present in Azure AD .
- **PolicyEnabled:** - Set to "YES" if the WHFB policy is enabled on the device.
- **PostLogonEnabled:** - Set to "YES" if WHFB enrollment is triggered natively by the platform. If it's set to "NO", it indicates that Windows Hello for Business enrollment is triggered by a custom mechanism
- **DeviceEligible:** - Set to “YES” if the device meets the hardware requirement for enrolling with WHFB.
- **SessionIsNotRemote:** - Set to “YES” if the current user is logged in directly to the device and not remotely.
- **CertEnrollment:** - Specific to WHFB Certificate Trust deployment, indicating the certificate enrollment authority for WHFB. Set to “enrollment authority” if source of WHFB policy is Group Policy, “mobile device management” if source is MDM. “none” otherwise
- **AdfsRefreshToken:** - Specific to WHFB Certificate Trust deployment. Only present if CertEnrollment is “enrollment authority”. Indicates if the device has an enterprise PRT for the user.
- **AdfsRaIsReady:** - Specific to WHFB Certificate Trust deployment.  Only present if CertEnrollment is “enrollment authority”. Set to “YES” if ADFS indicated in discovery metadata that it supports WHFB *and* if logon certificate template is available.
- **LogonCertTemplateReady:** - Specific to WHFB Certificate Trust deployment. Only present if CertEnrollment is “enrollment authority”. Set to “YES” if state of logon certificate template is valid and helps troubleshoot ADFS RA.
- **PreReqResult:** - Provides result of all WHFB prerequisite evaluation. Set to “Will Provision” if WHFB enrollment would be launched as a post-logon task when user signs in next time.
