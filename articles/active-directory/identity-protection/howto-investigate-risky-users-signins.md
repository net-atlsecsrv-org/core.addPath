# How To: Investigate risky users and sign-ins 


Using the Risky Sign-Ins and Risky Users reports you can investigate and gain insight into risk in your environment. With the ability to filter and sort the risky sign-ins and users, you can better understand potential intrusion in your organization. 


## Risky users report

With the information provided by the risky users report, you can find answers to questions such as:

- Which users are high risk?
- Which users have a risk state of remediated?



Your first entry point to this report is the **Investigate** section on the security page.

![Risky users report](./media/howto-investigate-risky-users-signins/01.png)


The risky users report has a default view that shows:

- Name

- Risk state

- Risk level

- Risk detail

- Risk last updated

- Type

- Status
 

![Risky users report](./media/howto-investigate-risky-users-signins/03.png)


You can customize the list view by clicking **Columns** in the toolbar.

![Risky users report](./media/howto-investigate-risky-users-signins/04.png)

The columns dialog enables you to display additional fields or remove fields that are already displayed.

By clicking an item in the list view, you get all available details about it in a horizontal view.

![Risky users report](./media/howto-investigate-risky-users-signins/05.png)


The details view shows:

- Basic info

- Recent risky sign-ins

- Risk events not linked to a sign-in

- Risk history



Additionally, you can:

![Risky users report](./media/howto-investigate-risky-users-signins/08.png)

- View all sign-ins shortcut to view the sign-ins report for that user.

- View all risky sign-ins to view all the sign-ins for that user that were flagged as risky.

- Reset a userâ€™s password if you believe that the user's identity has been compromised.

- Dismiss user risk if you think that the active risk events of a user are false positives. For more information, see [how to improve the detection accuracy](howto-improve-detection-accuracy.md).



### Filter risky users

To narrow down the reported data to a level that works for you, you can filter the risky user data using the following default fields:

- Name

- Username

- Risk state

- Risk level

- Type

- Status

![Risky users report](./media/howto-investigate-risky-users-signins/06.png)



The **Name** filter enables you to specify the name or the user principal name (UPN) of the user you care about.


The **Risk state** filter enables you to select:

- At risk
- Remediated
- Dismissed


The **Risk level** filter enables you to select:

- High
- Medium
- Low


The **Type** filter enables you to select:

- Guest
- Member

The **Status** filter enables you to select:

- Active


### Download risky users data

You can download the risky users data if you want to work with it outside the Azure portal. Clicking Download creates a CSV file of the most recent 2,500 records.
