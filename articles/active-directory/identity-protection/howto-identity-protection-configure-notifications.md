# Azure Active Directory Identity Protection notifications

Azure AD Identity Protection sends two types of automated notification emails to help you manage user risk and risk detections:

- Users at risk detected email
- Weekly digest email

This article provides you with an overview of both notification emails.

## Users at risk detected email

In response to a detected account at risk, Azure AD Identity Protection generates an email alert with **Users at risk detected** as subject. The email includes a link to the **[Users flagged for risk](./overview-identity-protection.md)** report. As a best practice, you should immediately investigate the users at risk.

The configuration for this alert allows you to specify at what user risk level you want the alert to be generated. The email will be generated when the user's risk level reaches what you have specified. For example, if you set the policy to alert on medium user risk and your user John's user risk score moves to medium risk due to a real-time sign-in risk, you will receive the users at risk detected email. If the user has subsequent risk detections that cause the user risk level calculation to be the specified risk level (or higher), you will receive additional user at risk detected emails when the user risk score is recalculated. For example, if a user moves to medium risk on January 1st, you will receive an email notification if your settings are set to alert on medium risk. If that same user then has another risk detection on January 5th that's also medium risk, and the user risk score is recalculated and is still medium, you will receive another email notification. 

However, an additional email notification will only be sent if the time the risk detection occurred (that caused the change in user risk level) is more recent than when the last email was sent. For example, a user sign-ins on January 1st at 5 AM and there is no real-time risk (meaning no email would be generated due to that sign-in). Ten minutes later, at 5:10 AM, the same user signs-in again and has high real-time risk, causing the user risk level to move to high and an email to be sent. Then, at 5:15 AM, the offline risk score for the original sign-in at 5 AM changes to high risk due to offline risk processing. An additional user flagged for risk e-mail would not be sent, since the time of the first sign-in was before the second sign-in that already triggered an email notification.

To prevent an overload of e-mails, you will only receive one users at risk detected email within a 5 second time period. This means that if multiple users move to the specified risk level during the same 5 second time period, we will aggregate and send one e-mail to represent the change in risk level for all of them.

### Configure users at risk detected alerts

As an administrator, you can set:

- **The user risk level that triggers the generation of this email** - By default, the risk level is set to “High” risk.
- **The recipients of this email** - By default, recipients include all Global Admins. Global Admins can also add other Global Admins, Security Admins, Security Readers as recipients.
   - Optionally you can **Add additional emails to receive alert notifications** this feature is a preview and users defined must have the appropriate permissions to view the linked reports in the Azure portal.

Configure the users at risk email in the **Azure portal** under **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Identity Protection** > **Users at risk detected alerts**.

## Weekly digest email

The weekly digest email contains a summary of new risk detections.  
It includes:

- New risky users detected
- New risky sign-ins detected (in real-time)
- Links to the related reports in Identity Protection

By default, recipients include all Global Admins. Global Admins can also add other Global Admins, Security Admins, Security Readers as recipients.

### Configure weekly digest email

As an administrator, you can switch sending a weekly digest email on or off and choose the users assigned to receive the email.

Configure the weekly digest email in the **Azure portal** under **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Identity Protection** > **Weekly digest**.
