# Conditional Access: Require compliant devices

Organizations who have deployed Microsoft Intune can use the information returned from their devices to identify devices that meet compliance requirements such as:

* Requiring a PIN to unlock
* Requiring device encryption
* Requiring a minimum or maximum operating system version
* Requiring a device is not jailbroken or rooted

This policy compliance information is forwarded to Azure AD where Conditional Access can make decisions to grant or block access to resources.

## Create a Conditional Access policy

The following steps will help create a Conditional Access policy to require devices accessing resources be marked as compliant with your organization's Intune compliance policies.

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a global administrator, security administrator, or Conditional Access administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users and groups**
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
   1. If you must exclude specific applications from your policy, you can choose them from the **Exclude** tab under **Select excluded cloud apps** and choose **Select**.
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Require device to be marked as compliant**.
   1. Select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **On**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.
