# Azure Active Directory Conditional Access settings reference

You can use [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Conditional Access](../active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md) to control how authorized users can access your resources.

This article provides you with support information for the following configuration options in a Conditional Access policy:

- Cloud applications assignments
- Device platform condition
- Client applications condition
- Approved client application requirement

If this is not the information you are looking for, please leave a comment at the end of this article.

## Cloud apps assignments

With Conditional Access policies, you control how your users access your [cloud apps](conditions.md#cloud-apps-and-actions). When you configure a Conditional Access policy, you need to select at least one cloud app.

- Android
- iOS
- Windows Phone
- Windows
- macOS

![Tie the access policy to the client OS](./media/technical-reference/41.png)

If you block legacy authentication using the **Other clients** condition, you can also set the device platform condition.

## Client apps condition

In your Conditional Access policy, you can configure the [client apps](conditions.md#client-apps) condition to tie the policy to the client app that has initiated an access attempt. Set the client apps condition to grant or block access when an access attempt is made from the following types of client apps:

- Browser
- Mobile apps and desktop apps

![Control access for client apps](./media/technical-reference/03.png)

### Supported browsers

In your Conditional Access policy, you can select **Browsers** as client app.

![Control access for supported browsers](./media/technical-reference/05.png)

This setting works with all browsers. However, to satisfy a device policy, like a compliant device requirement, the following operating systems and browsers are supported:

| OS                     | Browsers                                        |
| :--                    | :--                                             |
| Windows 10             | Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome       |
| Windows 8 / 8.1        | Internet Explorer, Chrome                       |
| Windows 7              | Internet Explorer, Chrome                       |
| iOS                    | Microsoft Edge, Intune Managed Browser, Safari  |
| Android                | Microsoft Edge, Intune Managed Browser, Chrome  |
| Windows Phone          | Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer               |
| Windows Server 2019    | Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome       |
| Windows Server 2016    | Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer               |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | Internet Explorer                       |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | Internet Explorer                       |
| macOS                  | Chrome, Safari                                  |


#### Why do I see a certificate prompt in the browser

On Windows 7, iOS, Android, and macOS Azure AD identifies the device using a client certificate that is provisioned when the device is registered with Azure AD.  When a user first signs in through the browser the user is prompted to select the certificate. The user must select this certificate before using the browser.

#### Chrome support

For Chrome support in **Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703)** or later, install the [Windows 10 Accounts extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/windows-10-accounts/ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji). This extension is required when a Conditional Access policy requires device specific details.

To automatically deploy this extension to Chrome browsers, create the following registry key:

|    |    |
| --- | --- |
| Path | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallForcelist |
| Name | 1 |
| Type | REG_SZ (String) |
| Data | ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji;https\://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx |

For Chrome support in **Windows 8.1 and 7**, create the following registry key:

|    |    |
| --- | --- |
| Path | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\AutoSelectCertificateForUrls |
| Name | 1 |
| Type | REG_SZ (String) |
| Data | {"pattern":"https://device.login.microsoftonline.com","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":"MS-Organization-Access"}}} |

These browsers support device authentication, allowing the device to be identified and validated against a policy. The device check fails if the browser is running in private mode.

### Supported mobile applications and desktop clients

In your Conditional Access policy, you can select **Mobile apps and desktop clients** as client app.

![Control access for supported mobile apps or desktop clients](./media/technical-reference/06.png)

This setting has an impact on access attempts made from the following mobile apps and desktop clients:

For more information, see [Client apps](conditions.md#client-apps).

## Approved client app requirement
