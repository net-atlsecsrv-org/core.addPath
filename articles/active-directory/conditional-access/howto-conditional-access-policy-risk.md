# Conditional Access: Sign-in risk-based Conditional Access

Most users have a normal behavior that can be tracked, when they fall outside of this norm it could be risky to allow them to just sign in. You may want to block that user or maybe just ask them to perform multi-factor authentication to prove that they are really who they say they are. 

A sign-in risk represents the probability that a given authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner. Organizations with Azure AD Premium P2 licenses can create Conditional Access policies incorporating [Azure AD Identity Protection sign-in risk detections](../identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks.md#sign-in-risk).

There are two locations where this policy may be assigned. Organizations should choose one of the following options to enable a sign-in risk-based Conditional Access policy requiring a secure password change.

## Enable with Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a global administrator, security administrator, or Conditional Access administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users and groups**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
1. Under **Conditions** > **User risk**, set **Configure** to **Yes**. Under **Select the sign-in risk level this policy will apply to** 
   1. Select **High** and **Medium**.
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require multi-factor authentication**, and select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **On**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

## Enable through Identity Protection

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
1. Select **All services**, then browse to **Azure AD Identity Protection**.
1. Select **Sign-in risk policy**.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Select excluded users**, choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts, and select **Select**.
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Conditions**, select **Sign-in risk**, then choose **Medium and above**.
   1. Select **Select**, then **Done**.
1. Under **Controls** > **Access**, choose **Allow access**, and then select **Require multi-factor authentication**.
   1. Select **Select**.
1. Set **Enforce Policy** to **On**.
1. Select **Save**.
