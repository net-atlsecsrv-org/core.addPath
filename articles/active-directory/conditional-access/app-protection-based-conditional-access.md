# Require app protection policy for cloud app access with Conditional Access (preview)

Your employees use mobile devices for both personal and work tasks. While making sure your employees can be productive, you also want to prevent data loss. With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Conditional Access, you can protect your corporate data by restricting access to your cloud apps. Use client apps with an app protection policy first.

This article explains how to configure Conditional Access policies that can require an app protection policy before access is granted to data.

## Overview

With [Azure AD Conditional Access](overview.md), you can fine-tune how authorized users can access your resources. For example, you can limit the access to your cloud apps to trusted devices.

You can use [Intune app protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-protection-policy) to help protect your company’s data. Intune app protection policies don't require a mobile device management (MDM) solution. You can protect your company’s data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution.

Azure Active Directory Conditional Access restricts access to your cloud apps to client applications that Intune has reported to Azure AD as receiving an app protection policy. For example, you can restrict access to Exchange Online to the Outlook app that has an Intune app protection policy.

In the Conditional Access terminology, these client apps are known to be policy protected with an *app protection policy*.  

![Conditional Access](./media/app-protection-based-conditional-access/05.png)

For a list of policy-protected client apps, see [App protection policy requirement](technical-reference.md#approved-client-app-requirement).

You can combine app-protection-based Conditional Access policies with other policies, such as [device-based Conditional Access policies](require-managed-devices.md). This way, you can provide flexibility in how to protect data for both personal and corporate devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access app protection policies cannot be applied to B2B users because the inviting organization has no visibility into the B2B user's home organization.

## Benefits of app protection-based Conditional Access requirement

Similar to compliance that's reported by Intune for iOS and Android for a managed device, Intune now reports to Azure AD if an app protection policy is applied. Conditional Access can use this policy as an access check. This new Conditional Access policy, the app protection policy, increases security. It protects against admin errors, such as:

- Users who don't have an Intune license.
- Users who can't receive an Intune app protection policy.
- Intune app protection policy apps that aren't configured to receive a policy.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you're familiar with:

- The [app protection policy requirement](technical-reference.md#app-protection-policy-requirement) technical reference.
- The [approved client app requirement](technical-reference.md#approved-client-app-requirement) technical reference.
- The basic concepts of [Conditional Access in Azure Active Directory](overview.md).
- How to [configure a Conditional Access policy](app-based-mfa.md).

## Prerequisites

To create an app protection-based Conditional Access policy, you must:

- Have an Enterprise Mobility + Security or an Azure Active Directory premium subscription + Intune.
- Make sure the users are licensed for Enterprise Mobility + Security or Azure AD + Intune.
- Make sure the client app is configured in Intune to receive an app protection policy.
- Make sure the users are configured in Intune to receive an Intune app protection policy.

## App protection-based policy for Exchange Online

This scenario consists of an app protection-based Conditional Access policy for access to Exchange Online.

### Scenario playbook

This scenario assumes that a user:

- Configures email by using a native mail application on iOS or Android to connect to Exchange.
- Receives an email that indicates that access is available only by using the Outlook app.
- Downloads the application with the link.
- Opens the Outlook application and signs in with Azure AD credentials.
- Is prompted to install either the **Microsoft Authenticator app** or the **Intune Company Portal** to continue.
- Installs the application and returns to the Outlook app to continue.
- Is prompted to register a device.
- Can receive an Intune app protection policy.
- Can access email.

Any Intune app protection policies must be on the application to access corporate data. The policies might prompt the user to restart the application or use an additional PIN. This is the case if the policies are configured for the application and platform.

## App protection-based or app-based policy for Exchange Online and SharePoint Online

This scenario consists of an app protection-based or approved apps policy for access to Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.

### Scenario playbook

This scenario assumes that a user:

- Configures client applications that are either on the list of apps that support the app protection policy requirement or the approved apps requirement.  
- Uses client applications that meet the app protection policy requirement and can receive an Intune app protection policy.
- Uses client applications that meet the approved apps policy requirement that supports Intune app protection policy.
- Opens the application to access email or documents.
- Opens the Outlook application and signs in with Azure AD credentials.
- Is prompted to install either Microsoft Authenticator for iOS use or Intune Company Portal for Android use if they're not already installed.
- Installs the application and can return to the Outlook app to continue.
- Is prompted to register a device.
- Can receive an Intune app protection policy.
- Can access email with Outlook and an Intune app protection policy.
- Can access sites and documents with an app not on the app protection policy requirement but listed in the approved app requirement.

Any Intune app protection policies are required before access is granted to corporate data. The policies might prompt the user to restart the application or use an additional PIN. This is the case if the policies are configured for the application and platform.

**Remarks**

- You can use this scenario if you want to support both app protection-based and app-based Conditional Access policies.
- In this *OR* policy, apps with an app protection policy requirement are evaluated for access first before the approved client apps requirement.
