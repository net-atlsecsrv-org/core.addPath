# Conditional Access: Require trusted location for MFA registration

Securing when and how users register for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and self-service password reset is now possible with user actions in Conditional Access policy. This preview feature is available to organizations who have enabled the [combined registration preview](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md). This functionality may be enabled in organizations where they want to use conditions like trusted network location to restrict access to register for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and SSPR. For more information about creating trusted locations in Conditional Access, see the article [What is the location condition in Azure Active Directory Conditional Access?](../conditional-access/location-condition.md#named-locations)

## Create a policy to require registration from a trusted location

The following policy applies to all selected users, who attempt to register using the combined registration experience, and blocks access unless they are connecting from a location marked as trusted network.

1. In the **Azure portal**, browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. In Name, Enter a Name for this policy. For example, **Combined Security Info Registration on Trusted Networks**.
1. Under **Assignments**, click **Users and groups**, and select the users and groups you want this policy to apply to.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Users must be enabled for the [combined registration preview](../authentication/howto-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).

1. Under **Cloud apps or actions**, select **User actions**, check **Register security information (preview)**.
1. Under **Conditions** > **Locations**.
   1. Configure **Yes**.
   1. Include **Any location**.
   1. Exclude **All trusted locations**.
   1. Click **Done** on the Locations blade.
   1. Click **Done** on the Conditions blade.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**.
   1. Click **Block access**.
   1. Then click **Select**.
1. Set **Enable policy** to **On**.
1. Then click **Save**.
