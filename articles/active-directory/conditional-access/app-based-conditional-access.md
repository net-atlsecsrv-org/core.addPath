# How To: Require approved client apps for cloud app access with Conditional Access 

Your employees use mobile devices for both personal and work tasks. While making sure your employees can be productive, you also want to prevent data loss. With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Conditional Access, you can restrict access to your cloud apps to approved client apps that can protect your corporate data.  

This topic explains how to configure condition access policies that require approved client apps.

## Overview

With [Azure AD Conditional Access](overview.md), you can fine-tune how authorized users can access your resources. For example, you can limit the access to your cloud apps to trusted devices.

You can use [Intune app protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-protection-policy) to help protect your company’s data. Intune app protection policies don't require mobile-device management (MDM) solution, which enables you to protect your company’s data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution.

Azure Active Directory Conditional Access enables you to limit access to your cloud apps to client apps that support Intune app protection policies. For example, you can restrict access to Exchange Online to the Outlook app.

In the Conditional Access terminology, these client apps are known as **approved client apps**.

For a list of approved client apps, see [approved client app requirement](technical-reference.md#approved-client-app-requirement).

You can combine app-based Conditional Access policies with other policies such as [device-based Conditional Access policies](require-managed-devices.md) to provide flexibility in how to protect data for both personal and corporate devices.

## Before you begin

This topic assumes that you are familiar with:

- The [approved client app requirement](technical-reference.md#approved-client-app-requirement) technical reference.
- The basic concepts of [Conditional Access in Azure Active Directory](overview.md).
- How to [configure a Conditional Access policy](app-based-mfa.md).
- The [migration of Conditional Access policies](best-practices.md#policy-migration).

## Prerequisites

To create an app-based Conditional Access policy, you must have an Enterprise Mobility + Security or an Azure Active Directory premium subscription, and the users must be licensed for EMS or Azure AD. 

## Exchange Online policy 

This scenario consists of an app-based Conditional Access policy for access to Exchange Online.

### Scenario playbook

This scenario assumes that a user:

- Configures email using a native mail application on iOS or Android to connect to Exchange
- Receives an email that indicates that access is only available using Outlook app
- Downloads the application with the link
- Opens the Outlook application and signs in with the Azure AD credentials
- Is prompted to install either Authenticator (iOS) or Company Portal (Android) to continue
- Installs the application and can return to the Outlook app to continue
- Is prompted to register a device
- Is able to access email

Any Intune app protection policies are activated at the time the access corporate data and may prompt the user to restart the application, use an additional PIN etc. (if configured for the application and platform).

### Configuration 

**Step 1 - Configure an Azure AD Conditional Access policy for Exchange Online**

For the Conditional Access policy in this step, you need to configure the following components:

1. The **Name** of your Conditional Access policy.
1. **Users and groups**: Each Conditional Access policy must have at least one user or group selected.
1. **Cloud apps:** As cloud apps, you need to select **Office 365 Exchange Online**.
1. **Conditions:** As **Conditions**, you need to configure **Device platforms** and **Client apps**:
   1. As **Device platforms**, select **Android** and **iOS**.
   1. As **Client apps (preview)**, select **Mobile apps and desktop apps** and **Modern authentication clients**.
1. As **Access controls**, you need to have **Require approved client app (preview)** selected.
