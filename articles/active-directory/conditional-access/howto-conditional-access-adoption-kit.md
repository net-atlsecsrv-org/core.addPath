#  Adopting Azure AD Conditional Access

In a mobile-first, cloud-first world, users can access your organization's resources from anywhere using different kinds of devices and apps. As a result, just focusing on who can access a resource is no longer enough. You can control who has access and identify where the user is and what device is being used and much more.

To provide this control, **Azure Active Directory (AD) Conditional Access** allows you to specify the conditions any user must meet for access to an application, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Using Conditional Access policies controls how authorized users (users that have been granted access to a cloud app) access cloud apps under specific conditions. Refer to [What is Conditional Access in Azure Active Directory](overview.md) for more information.

## Key benefits

The key benefits of using Azure AD Conditional Access are:

* **Increase Productivity:** Conditional Access (CA) policies allow you to target the point at which users are prompted to use MFA, have access blocked, or are required to use a trusted device. For example, you can set policies such as only requiring users to MFA into an application when off the corporate network. Reducing MFA requests keeps users more productive than if they have to MFA each time they sign in. Furthermore, Azure AD Conditional Access allows you to specify policies per user basis and also creates app-specific policies.
* **Manage Risk:** Enabling Conditional Access policies provides you with cloud-scale identity protection, risk-based access control capabilities, and native multi-factor authentication support. Coupling Conditional Access with identity protection allows you to define when access to an application is blocked or gated.
* **Address Compliance and Governance:** Auditing access requests and approvals for the application, and understanding overall application usage is easier with Azure AD because it supports native audit logs for every application access request performed. Auditing includes requester identity, requested date, business justification, approval status, and approver identity. This data is also available from an API, which will enable importation of this data into a Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) system of choice.
* **Manage Cost:** Moving access policies to Azure AD reduces reliance on custom or on-premises solutions such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) for Conditional Access, reducing the cost of running that infrastructure.

## Customer case studies

Discover how most organizations use Azure AD Conditional Access to define and implement automated access control decisions to access cloud apps based on conditions. The following featured stories demonstrate how these customer needs are met.

* [**Wipro** drives mobile productivity with Microsoft cloud security tools to improve customer engagements.](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/wipro-professional-services-enterprise-mobility-security) The Conditional Access policies in Azure AD have enabled the company to share documents, resources, and applications with trusted outside entities---who can use their own credentials---while maintaining control over its own corporate data.
* [**Accenture** safeguards its move to the cloud with Microsoft Cloud App security](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/accenture-professional-services-cloud-app-security) Accenture is evaluating the [Conditional Access App Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-intro-aad) feature of Cloud App Security, which uses Azure Active Directory Conditional Access to gate application access based on certain conditions. LePenske says that this feature could be useful for, say, enabling read-only file access while prohibiting downloads.
* [**Aramex** delivery limited - Global logistics and transportation company creates cloud-connected office with identity and access management solution](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/aramex-azure-active-directory-travel-transportation-united-arab-emirates-en). Ensuring secure access was especially difficult with Aramex's remote employees. The company is now applying Conditional Access to let these remote employees access their SaaS applications from outside the network. The Conditional Access rule will decide whether to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication, giving only the right people the right access.

## Guidance for IT administrators

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a global administrator, security administrator, or Conditional Access administrator. Refer to [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory.](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md)

As an IT administrator, use [Azure AD Conditional Access](overview.md) to require users to authenticate using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, sign in from a trusted network, or trusted device.

## End-user readiness and communication

Conditional Access uses other Azure AD capabilities that may affect the end user experience. For example, you can use Azure Multi-factor authentication to enable strong authentication for users. In that case, you will use the end-user templates of Azure MFA.
