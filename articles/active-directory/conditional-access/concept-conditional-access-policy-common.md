# Common Conditional Access policies

[Security defaults](../fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md) are great for some but many organizations need more flexibility than they offer. For example, many organizations need the ability to exclude specific accounts like their emergency access or break-glass administration accounts from Conditional Access policies requiring multi-factor authentication. For those organizations, the common policies referenced in this article can be of use.

![Conditional Access policies in the Azure portal](./media/concept-conditional-access-policy-common/conditional-access-policies-azure-ad-listing.png)

## Emergency access accounts

More information about emergency access accounts and why they are important can be found in the following articles: 

* [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](../users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access.md)
* [Create a resilient access control management strategy with Azure Active Directory](../authentication/concept-resilient-controls.md)

## Typical policies deployed by organizations

* [Block legacy authentication](howto-conditional-access-policy-block-legacy.md)\*
* [Require MFA for administrators](howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa.md)\*
* [Require MFA for Azure management](howto-conditional-access-policy-azure-management.md)\*
* [Require MFA for all users](howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)\*

\* These four policies when configured together, mimic functionality enabled by [security defaults](../fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md).

## Additional policies

* [Sign-in risk-based Conditional Access (Requires Azure AD Premium P2)](howto-conditional-access-policy-risk.md)
* [User risk-based Conditional Access (Requires Azure AD Premium P2)](howto-conditional-access-policy-risk-user.md)
* [Require trusted location for MFA registration](howto-conditional-access-policy-registration.md)
* [Block access by location](howto-conditional-access-policy-location.md)
* [Require compliant device](howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device.md)
* [Block access except specific apps](howto-conditional-access-policy-block-access.md)
