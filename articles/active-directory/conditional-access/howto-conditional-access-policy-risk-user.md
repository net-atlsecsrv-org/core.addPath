# Conditional Access: User risk-based Conditional Access

Microsoft works with researchers, law enforcement, various security teams at Microsoft, and other trusted sources to find leaked username and password pairs. Organizations with Azure AD Premium P2 licenses can create Conditional Access policies incorporating [Azure AD Identity Protection user risk detections](../identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks.md#user-risk). 

There are two locations where this policy may be assigned. Organizations should choose one of the following options to enable a user risk-based Conditional Access policy requiring a secure password change.

## Enable with Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a global administrator, security administrator, or Conditional Access administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users and groups**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
1. Under **Conditions** > **User risk**, set **Configure** to **Yes**. Under **Configure user risk levels needed for policy to be enforced** select **High**, then select **Done**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require password change**, and select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings, and set **Enable policy** to **On**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

## Enable through Identity Protection

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
1. Select **All services**, then browse to **Azure AD Identity Protection**.
1. Select **User risk policy**.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Select excluded users**, choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts, and select **Select**.
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Conditions**, select **User risk**, then choose **High**.
   1. Select **Select**, then **Done**.
1. Under **Controls** > **Access**, choose **Allow access**, and then select **Require password change**.
   1. Select **Select**.
1. Set **Enforce Policy** to **On**.
1. Select **Save**.
