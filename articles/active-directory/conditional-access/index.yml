  description: "Learn how to master the balance between security and productivity by configuring Azure AD Conditional Access.
With Conditional Access policies, you can factor how your cloud apps are accessed into your access decisions.
For example, you can address in your access decisions the following questions:<ul><li>What is the user&#39;s network location?</li><li>Has the access attempt be initiated from a managed device?</li><li>From which client app has a connection attempt been initiated?</li><li>Has an access attempt been made from a risky sign-in?</li></ul>The following resources help you to quickly get started."
