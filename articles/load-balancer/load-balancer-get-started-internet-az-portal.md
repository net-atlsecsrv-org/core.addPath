#  Create a Standard Load Balancer with zone-redundant frontend using Azure portal

This article steps through creating a public [Standard Load Balancer](https://aka.ms/azureloadbalancerstandard) with a zone-redundant frontend using a Public IP Standard address. A single frontend IP address on a Standard Load Balancer is zone-redundant by default.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

> [!NOTE]
>  Support for Availability Zones is available for select Azure resources and regions, and VM size families. For more information on how to get started, and which Azure resources, regions, and VM size families you can try availability zones with, see [Overview of Availability Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/az-overview). For support, you can reach out on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-availability-zones) or [open an Azure support ticket](../azure-supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).  

## Log in to Azure 

Log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Create a zone redundant load balancer

1. From a browser navigate to the Azure portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and login with your Azure account.
2. On the top left-hand side of the screen, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Load Balancer.**
3. In the **Create load balancer** page, under **Name** type **myLoadBalancer**.
4. Under **Type**, select **Public**.
5. Under SKU, select **Standard**.
6. Click **Public IP address**, click **Create new**, and in **Create public IP address** page, under name, type **myPublicIPStandard**.
    >[!NOTE] 
    > The public IP created in this step is of Standard SKU and is zone-redundant by default. 
8. Under **Location**, select **East US2**, and then click **OK**. The load balancer then starts to deploy and takes a few minutes to successfully complete deployment.
