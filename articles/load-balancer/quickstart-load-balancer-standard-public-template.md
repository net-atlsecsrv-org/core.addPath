# Quickstart: Create a Standard load balancer to load balance VMs by using Azure Resource Manager template

Load balancing provides a higher level of availability and scale by spreading incoming requests across multiple virtual machines (VMs). This quickstart shows you how to deploy an Azure Resource Manager template that creates a Standard load balancer to load balance VMs. Using Resource Manager template takes fewer steps comparing to other deployment methods.

[Resource Manager template](../azure-resource-manager/template-deployment-overview.md) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. If you want to learn more about developing Resource Manager templates, see [Resource Manager documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/) and the [template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.network/loadbalancers).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a Standard load balancer

Standard Load Balancer supports only a Standard Public IP address. When you create a Standard load balancer, you must also create a new Standard Public IP address that is configured as the front end for the Standard load balancer.

The template used in this quickstart is a [Quickstart template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-load-balancer-standard-create/azuredeploy.json).

[!code-json[<Azure Resource Manager template create standard load balancer>](~/quickstart-templates/101-load-balancer-standard-create/azuredeploy.json)]

Multiple Azure resources have been defined in the template:

- **Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers**
- **Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses**: for the load balancer.
- **Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups**
- **Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks**
- **Microsoft.Compute/virutalMachines** (3 of them)
- **Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses** (3 of them): for each of the three virtual machines.
- **Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces** (3 of them)
- **Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/extensions** (3 of them): use to configure the IIS, and the web pages

To find more templates that are related to Azure Load Balancer, see [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Network&pageNumber=1&sort=Popular).

1. Select **Try it** from the following code block to open Azure Cloud Shell, and then follow the instructions to sign in to Azure.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $projectName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a project name with 12 or less letters or numbers that is used to generate Azure resource names"
   $location = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the location (i.e. centralus)"
   $adminUserName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the virtual machine administrator account name"
   $adminPassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the virtual machine administrator password" -AsSecureString

   $resourceGroupName = "${projectName}rg"
   $templateUri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-load-balancer-standard-create/azuredeploy.json"

   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateUri $templateUri -projectName $projectName -location $location -adminUsername $adminUsername -adminPassword $adminPassword

   Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue."
   ```

   Wait until you see the prompt from the console.

1. Select **Copy** from the previous code block to copy the PowerShell script.

1. Right-click the shell console pane and then select **Paste**.

1. Enter the values.

   The template deployment creates three availability zones. Availability zones are supported only in [certain regions](../availability-zones/az-overview.md). Use one of the supported regions. If you aren't sure, enter **centralus**.

   The resource group name is the project name with **rg** appended. You need the resource group name in the next section.

It takes about 10 minutes to deploy the template. When completed, the output is similar to:

![Azure Standard Load Balancer Resource Manager template PowerShell deployment output](./media/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-template/azure-standard-load-balancer-resource-manager-template-powershell-output.png)

Azure PowerShell is used to deploy the template. In addition to Azure PowerShell, you can also use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, and REST API. To learn other deployment methods, see [Deploy templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal.md).

## Test the load balancer

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Resource groups** from the left pane.

1. Select the resource group that you created in the previous section. The default resource group name is the project name with **rg** appended.

1. Select the load balancer. Its default name is the project name with **-lb** appended.

1. Copy only the IP address part of the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser.

   ![Azure standard load balancer Resource Manager template public IP](./media/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-template/azure-standard-load-balancer-resource-manager-template-deployment-public-ip.png)

    The browser displays the default page of the Internet Information Services (IIS) web server.

   ![IIS web server](./media/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-template/load-balancer-test-web-page.png)

To see the load balancer distribute traffic across all three VMs, you can force a refresh of your web browser from the client machine.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need them, delete the resource group, the load balancer, and all related resources. To do so, go to the Azure portal, select the resource group that contains the load balancer, and then select **Delete resource group**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a Standard load balancer, attached VMs to it, configured the load-balancer traffic rule, did a health probe, and then tested the load balancer.
