# Frequently asked questions

## What types of Load Balancer exist?
Internal load balancers which balance traffic within a VNET and external load balancers which balance traffic to and from an internet connected endpoint. For more information, see [Load Balancer Types](components.md#frontend-ip-configurations). 

For both these types, Azure offers a Basic SKU and Standard SKU that have different functional, performance, security and health tracking capabilities. These differences are explained in our [SKU Comparison](skus.md) article.

 ## How can I upgrade from a Basic to a Standard Load Balancer?
See the [upgrade from Basic to Standard](upgrade-basic-standard.md) article for an automated script and guidance on upgrading a Load Balancer SKU.

 ## What are the different load-balancing options in Azure?
See the [load balancer technology guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview)  for the available load-balancing services and recommended uses for each.

## Where can I find Load Balancer ARM templates?
See the [list of Azure Load Balancer quickstart templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.network/loadbalancers#quickstart-templates) for ARM templates of common deployments.

## How are inbound NAT rules different from load-balancing rules?
NAT rules are used to specify a backend resource to route traffic to. For example, configuring a specific load balancer port to send RDP traffic to a specific VM. Load-balancing rules are used to specify a pool of backend resources to route traffic to, balancing the load across each instance. For example, a load balancer rule can route TCP packets on port 80 of the load balancer across a pool of web servers.

## What is IP 168.63.129.16?
The virtual IP address for the host tagged as the Azure infrastructure Load Balancer where the Azure Health Probes originate. When configuring backend instances, they must allow traffic from this IP address to successfully respond to health probes. This rule does not interact with access to your Load Balancer frontend. If you're not using the Azure Load Balancer, you can override this rule. You can learn more about service tags [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#available-service-tags).
