# Tutorial: Load balance VMs across availability zones with a Standard Load Balancer using the Azure portal

Load balancing provides a higher level of availability by spreading incoming requests across multiple virtual machines. This tutorial steps through creating a public Standard Load Balancer that load balances VMs across availability zones. This helps to protect your apps and data from an unlikely failure or loss of an entire datacenter. With zone-redundancy, one or more availability zones can fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy. You learn how to:

For more information about using Availability zones with Standard Load Balancer, see [Standard Load Balancer and Availability Zones](load-balancer-standard-availability-zones.md).

If you prefer, you can complete this tutorial using the [Azure CLI](./quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-cli.md).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. 

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a Standard Load Balancer

Standard Load Balancer only supports a Standard Public IP address. When you create a new public IP while creating the load balancer, it is automatically configured as a Standard SKU version, and is also automatically zone-redundant.

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, click **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Load Balancer**.
2. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create load balancer** page, enter or select the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Review + create**:

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Subscription               | Select your subscription.    |    
    | Resource group         | Select **Create new** and type *MyResourceGroupLBAZ* in the text box.|
    | Name                   | *myLoadBalancer*                                   |
    | Region         | Select **West Europe**.                                        |
    | Type          | Select **Public**.                                        |
    | SKU           | Select **Standard**.                          |
    | Public IP address | Select **Create new**. |
    | Public IP address name              | Type *myPublicIP* in the text box.   |
    |Availability zone| Select **Zone redundant**.    |
   

## Create backend servers

In this section, you create a virtual network, virtual machines in different zones for the region, and then install IIS on the virtual machines to help test the zone-redundant load balancer. Hence, if a zone fails, the health probe for VM in the same zone fails, and traffic continues to be served by VMs in the other zones.

## Virtual network and parameters

In this section you'll need to replace the following parameters in the steps with the information below:

| Parameter                   | Value                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| **\<resource-group-name>**  | myResourceGroupLBAZ (Select existing resource group) |
| **\<virtual-network-name>** | myVNet          |
| **\<region-name>**          | West Europe      |
| **\<IPv4-address-space>**   | 10.0.0.0/16          |
| **\<subnet-name>**          | myBackendSubnet        |
| **\<subnet-address-range>** | 10.0.0.0/24          |

[!INCLUDE [virtual-networks-create-new](../../includes/virtual-networks-create-new.md)]

## Create a network security group

Create network security group to define inbound connections to your virtual network.

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, click **Create a resource**, in the search box type *Network Security Group*, and in the network security group page, click **Create**.
2. In the Create network security group page, enter these values:
    - *myNetworkSecurityGroup*  - for the name of the network security group.
    - *myResourceGroupLBAZ* - for the name of the existing resource group.
   
![Screenshot shows the Create network security group pane.](./media/load-balancer-standard-public-availability-zones-portal/create-nsg.png)

### Create network security group rules

In this section, you create network security group rules to allow inbound connections using HTTP and RDP using the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, click **All resources** in the left-hand menu, and then search and click **myNetworkSecurityGroup** that is located in the **myResourceGroupLBAZ** resource group.
2. Under **Settings**, click **Inbound security rules**, and then click **Add**.
3. Enter these values for the inbound security rule named *myHTTPRule* to allow for an inbound HTTP connections using port 80:
    - *Service Tag* - for **Source**.
    - *Internet* - for **Source service tag**
    - *80* - for **Destination port ranges**
    - *TCP* - for **Protocol**
    - *Allow* - for **Action**
    - *100* for **Priority**
    - *myHTTPRule* - for name of the load balancer rule.
    - *Allow HTTP* - for description of the load balancer rule.
4. Click **OK**.
 
   ![Screenshot shows the Add inbound security rule pane.](./media/load-balancer-standard-public-availability-zones-portal/8-load-balancer-nsg-rules.png)
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to create another rule named *myRDPRule* to allow for an inbound RDP connection using port 3389 with the following values:
    - *Service Tag* - for **Source**.
    - *Internet* - for **Source service tag**
    - *3389* - for **Destination port ranges**
    - *TCP* - for **Protocol**
    - *Allow* - for **Action**
    - *200* for **Priority**
    - *myRDPRule* for name
    - *Allow RDP* - for description

### Create virtual machines

Create virtual machines in different zones (zone 1, zone 2, and zone 3) for the region that can act as backend servers to the load balancer.

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, click **Create a resource** > **Compute** > **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** and enter these values for the virtual machine:
    - *myVM1* - for the name of the virtual machine.        
    - *azureuser* - for the administrator user name.    
    - *myResourceGroupLBAZ* - for **Resource group**, select **Use existing**, and then select *myResourceGroupLBAZ*.
2. Click **OK**.
3. Select **DS1_V2** for the size of the virtual machine, and click **Select**.
4. Enter these values for the VM settings:
    - *zone 1* - for the zone where you place the VM.
    -  *myVNet* - ensure it is selected as the virtual network.
    - *myBackendSubnet* - ensure it is selected as the subnet.
    - *myNetworkSecurityGroup* - for the name of network security group (firewall).
5. Click **Disabled** to disable boot diagnostics.
6. Click **OK**, review the settings on the summary page, and then click **Create**.
7. Create a second VM, named, *VM2* in Zone 2, and third VM in Zone 3, and with *myVnet* as the virtual network, *myBackendSubnet* as the subnet, and **myNetworkSecurityGroup* as the network security group using steps 1-6.

### Install IIS on VMs

1. Click **All resources** in the left-hand menu, and then from the resources list click **myVM1** that is located in the *myResourceGroupLBAZ* resource group.
2. On the **Overview** page, click **Connect** to RDP into the VM.
3. Log into the VM with username *azureuser*.
4. On the server desktop, navigate to **Windows Administrative Tools**>**Windows PowerShell**.
5. In the PowerShell Window, run the following commands to install the IIS server, remove the  default iisstart.htm file, and then add a new iisstart.htm file that displays the name of the VM:
   ```azurepowershell-interactive
    
    # install IIS server role
    Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
    
    # remove default htm file
     remove-item  C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm
    
    # Add a new htm file that displays server name
     Add-Content -Path "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm" -Value $("Hello World from" + $env:computername)
   ```
6. Close the RDP session with *myVM1*.
7. Repeat steps 1 to 6 to install IIS and the updated iisstart.htm file on *myVM2* and *myVM3*.

## Create load balancer resources

In this section, you configure load balancer settings for a backend address pool and a health probe, and specify load balancer and NAT rules.


### Create a backend address pool

To distribute traffic to the VMs, a back-end address pool contains the IP addresses of the virtual (NICs) connected to the load balancer. Create the backend address pool *myBackendPool* to include *VM1*, *VM2*, and *VM3*.

1. Click **All resources** in the left-hand menu, and then click **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, click **Backend pools**, then click **Add**.
3. On the **Add a backend pool** page, do the following:
    - For name, type *myBackEndPool*, as the name for your backend pool.
    - For **Virtual network**, in the drop-down menu, click **myVNet**
    - For **Virtual machine**, in the drop-down menu, click, **myVM1**.
    - For **IP address**, in the drop-down menu, click the IP address of myVM1.
4. Click **Add new backend resource** to add each virtual machine (*myVM2* and *myVM3*) to add to the backend pool of the load balancer.
5. Click **Add**.

    ![Adding to the backend address pool -](./media/load-balancer-standard-public-availability-zones-portal/add-backend-pool.png)

3. Check to make sure your load balancer backend pool setting displays all the three VMs - **myVM1**, **myVM2** and **myVM3**.

### Create a health probe

To allow the load balancer to monitor the status of your app, you use a health probe. The health probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks. Create a health probe *myHealthProbe* to monitor the health of the VMs.

1. Click **All resources** in the left-hand menu, and then click **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, click **Health probes**, then click **Add**.
3. Use these values to create the health probe:
    - *myHealthProbe* - for the name of the health probe.
    - **HTTP** - for the protocol type.
    - *80* - for the port number.
    - *15* - for number of **Interval** in seconds between probe attempts.
    - *2* - for number of **Unhealthy threshold** or consecutive probe failures that must occur before a VM is considered unhealthy.
4. Click **OK**.

   ![Adding a probe](./media/load-balancer-standard-public-availability-zones-portal/4-load-balancer-probes.png)

### Create a load balancer rule

A load balancer rule is used to define how traffic is distributed to the VMs. You define the front-end IP configuration for the incoming traffic and the back-end IP pool to receive the traffic, along with the required source and destination port. Create a load balancer rule *myLoadBalancerRuleWeb* for listening to port 80 in the frontend *FrontendLoadBalancer* and sending load-balanced network traffic to the backend address pool *myBackEndPool* also using port 80. 

1. Click **All resources** in the left-hand menu, and then click **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, click **Load balancing rules**, then click **Add**.
3. Use these values to configure the load balancing rule:
    - *myHTTPRule* - for the name of the load balancing rule.
    - **TCP** - for the protocol type.
    - *80* - for the port number.
    - *80* - for the backend port.
    - *myBackendPool* - for the name of the backend pool.
    - *myHealthProbe* - for the name of the health probe.
4. Click **OK**.
    
    
    ![Adding a load balancing rule](./media/load-balancer-standard-public-availability-zones-portal/load-balancing-rule.png)

## Test the load balancer
1. Find the public IP address for the Load Balancer on the **Overview** screen. Click **All resources** and then click **myPublicIP**.

2. Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser. The default page of IIS Web server is displayed on the browser.

      ![IIS Web server](./media/tutorial-load-balancer-standard-zonal-portal/load-balancer-test.png)

To see the load balancer distribute traffic across the VMs distributed across the zone you can force-refresh your web browser.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, load balancer, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group that contains the load balancer and select **Delete**.
