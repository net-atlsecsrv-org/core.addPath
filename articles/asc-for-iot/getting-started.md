# Get started with Azure Security Center for IoT

This article provides an explanation of the different components of the Azure Security Center for IoT service and explains how to get started with the service using two possible deployment options.

Looking for get started with the Security Module for Azure RTOS? Go to the [Quickstart for Security Module for Azure RTOS](quickstart-azure-rtos-security-module.md) section. 

## Deployment options

Choose the service scenario that best meets your IoT device and environment requirements.

### Built-in deployment

Using the seamless, built-in deployment option, Azure Security Center for IoT can be quickly integrated into your IoT Hub and provide security analysis of the IoT hub configuration, device identity and management, and hub-device communication patterns.

Start a [Built-in deployment](iot-hub-integration.md) featuring IoT Hub monitoring and recommendations.
