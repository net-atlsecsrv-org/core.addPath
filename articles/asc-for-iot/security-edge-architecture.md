# Azure IoT Edge security module

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Security Center for IoT service for IoT Edge is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

[Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/) provides powerful capabilities to manage and perform business workflows at the edge.
The key part that IoT Edge plays in IoT environments make it particularly attractive for malicious actors.

Azure Security Center for IoT security module provides a comprehensive security solution for your IoT Edge devices.
Azure Security Center for IoT module collects, aggregates and analyzes raw security data from your Operating System and container system into actionable security recommendations and alerts.

Similar to Azure Security Center for IoT security agents for IoT devices, the Azure Security Center for IoT Edge module is highly customizable through its module twin.
See [Configure your agent](how-to-agent-configuration.md) to learn more.

Azure Security Center for IoT security module for IoT Edge offers the following features:

- Collects raw security events from the underlying Operating System (Linux), and the IoT Edge Container systems.
  
  See [Azure Security Center for IoT agent configuration](how-to-agent-configuration.md) to learn more about available security data collectors.

- Analysis of IoT Edge deployment manifests.

- Aggregates raw security events into messages sent through [IoT Edge Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-runtime#iot-edge-hub).

- Remove configuration through use of the security module twin.

  See [Configure an Azure Security Center for IoT agent](how-to-agent-configuration.md) to learn more.

Azure Security Center for IoT security module for IoT Edge runs in a privileged mode under IoT Edge.
Privileged mode is required to allow the module to monitor the Operating System, and other IoT Edge modules.

## Module supported platforms

Azure Security Center for IoT security module for IoT Edge is currently only available for Linux.
