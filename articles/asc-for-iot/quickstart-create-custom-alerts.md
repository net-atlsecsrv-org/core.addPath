# Quickstart: Create custom alerts


Using custom security groups and alerts, takes full advantage of the end-to-end security information and categorical device knowledge to ensure better security across your IoT solution. 

## Why use custom alerts? 

You know your IoT devices best.

For customers who fully understand their expected device behavior, Azure Security Center for IoT allows you to translate this understanding into a device behavior policy and alert on any deviation from expected, normal behavior.

## Security groups

Security groups enable you to define logical groups of devices, and manage their security state in a centralized way.

These groups can represent devices with specific hardware, devices deployed in a certain location, or any other group suitable to your specific needs.

Security groups are defined by a device twin tag property named **SecurityGroup**. By default, each IoT solution on IoT Hub has one security group named **default**. Change the value of the **SecurityGroup** property to change the security group of a device.
 
For example:

```
{
  "deviceId": "VM-Contoso12",
  "etag": "AAAAAAAAAAM=",
  "deviceEtag": "ODA1BzA5QjM2",
  "status": "enabled",
  "statusUpdateTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
  "connectionState": "Disconnected",
  "lastActivityTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
  "cloudToDeviceMessageCount": 0,
  "authenticationType": "sas",
  "x509Thumbprint": {
    "primaryThumbprint": null,
    "secondaryThumbprint": null
  },
  "version": 4,
  "tags": {
    "SecurityGroup": "default"
  }, 
```

Use security groups to group your devices into logical categories. After creating the groups, assign them to the custom alerts of your choice, for the most effective end-to-end IoT security solution. 

## Customize an alert

1. Open your IoT Hub. 
2. Click **Custom alerts** in the **Security** section. 
3. Choose a security group you wish to apply the customization to. 
4. Click **Add a custom alert**.
5. Select a custom alert from the dropdown list. 
6. Edit the required properties, click **OK**.
7. Make sure to click **SAVE**. Without saving the new alert, the alert is deleted the next time you close IoT Hub.

 
## Alerts available for customization

The following table provides a summary of alerts available for customization.


| Severity | Name | Data Source | Description | Suggested remediation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low      | Custom alert - number of cloud to device messages in AMQP protocol is outside the allowed range          | IoT Hub     | Number of cloud to device messages (AMQP protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.||
| Low      | Custom alert - number of rejected cloud to device messages in AMQP protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | Number of cloud to device messages (AMQP protocol) rejected by the device, within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.||

| Low      | Custom alert - number of rejected cloud to device messages in MQTT protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of cloud to device messages (MQTT protocol) rejected by the device within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range. |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of device to cloud messages in MQTT protocol is outside the allowed range          | IoT Hub     | The amount of device to cloud messages (MQTT protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|
