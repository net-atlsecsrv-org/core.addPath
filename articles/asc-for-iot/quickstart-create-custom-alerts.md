# Quickstart: Create custom alerts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Security Center for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Using custom security groups and alerts, take full advantage of the end-to-end security information and categorical device knowledge to ensure better security across your IoT solution. 

## Why use custom alerts? 

You know your IoT devices best.

For customers who fully understand their expected device behavior, Azure Security Center (ASC) for IoT allows you to translate this understanding into a device behavior policy and alert on any deviation from expected, normal behavior.

## Security Groups

Security groups enable you to define logical groups of devices, and manage their security state in a centralized way.

These groups can represent devices with specific hardware, devices deployed in a certain location, or any other group suitable to your specific needs.

Security groups are defined by a security module twin tag property named **SecurityGroup**. Change the value of this property to change the security group of a device.  

By default, each IoT solution on IoT Hub has one security group named **default**.

Use security groups to group your devices into logical categories. After creating the groups, assign them to the custom alerts of your choice, for the most effective end-to-end solution. 

## Customize an alert

1. Open your IoT Hub. 
2. Click **Custom alerts** in the **Security** section. 
3. Choose a security group you wish to apply the customization to. 
4. Click **Add a custom alert** 
5. Select a custom alert behavior from the dropdown list. 
6. Edit the required properties, click **OK**.
7. Make sure to click **SAVE**. Without saving the new alert, the alert is deleted the next time you close IoT Hub.

 
## Alerts available for customization

The following table provides a summary of alerts available for customization.

| Severity | Name                                                                                                    | Data Source | Description                                                                                                                                     |
