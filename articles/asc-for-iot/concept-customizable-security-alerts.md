# Azure Security Center for IoT security alerts

Azure Security Center for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity.

We encourage you to create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior to ensure alerts act as the most efficient indicators of potential compromise in your unique organizational deployment and landscape. 

The following list of Azure Security Center for IoT alerts are definable by you based on your expected IoT Hub and/or device behavior. For more details about how to customize each alert, see [create custom alerts](quickstart-create-custom-alerts.md).

## IoT Hub alerts available for customization 



| Severity | Alert name | Data source | Description | Suggested remediation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low      | Custom alert - number of cloud to device messages in AMQP protocol is outside the allowed range          | IoT Hub     | Number of cloud to device messages (AMQP protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.||
| Low      | Custom alert - number of rejected cloud to device messages in AMQP protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | Number of cloud to device messages (AMQP protocol) rejected by the device, within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.||
| Low      | Custom alert - number of device to cloud messages in AMQP protocol is outside the allowed range      | IoT Hub     | The amount of device to cloud messages (AMQP protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|   |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of direct method invokes is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of direct method invokes within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.||
| Low      | Custom alert - number of file uploads is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of file uploads within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.| |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of cloud to device messages in HTTP protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of cloud to device messages (HTTP protocol) in a time window is not in the configured allowed range                                  |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of rejected cloud to device messages in HTTP protocol is not in the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of cloud to device messages (HTTP protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range. |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of device to cloud messages in HTTP protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub| The amount of device to cloud messages (HTTP protocol)within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|    |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of cloud to device messages in MQTT protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of cloud to device messages (MQTT protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|   |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of rejected cloud to device messages in MQTT protocol is outside the allowed range | IoT Hub     | The amount of cloud to device messages (MQTT protocol) rejected by the device within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range. |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of device to cloud messages in MQTT protocol is outside the allowed range          | IoT Hub     | The amount of device to cloud messages (MQTT protocol) within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|
| Low      | Custom alert - number of command queue purges is outside the allowed range                               | IoT Hub     | The amount of command queue purges within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.||
| Low      | Custom alert - number of module twin updates is outside the allowed range                                       | IoT Hub     | The amount of module twin updates within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|
| Low      | Custom alert - number of unauthorized operations is outside the allowed range  | IoT Hub     | The amount of unauthorized operations within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|
|

## Agent alerts available for customization 

| Severity | Alert name | Data source | Description | Suggested remediation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low      | Custom alert - number of active connections is outside the allowed range  | Agent       | Number of active connections within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range.|  Investigate the device logs. Learn where the connection originated and determine if it is benign or malicious. If malicious, remove possible malware and understand source. If benign, add the source to the allowed connection list.  |
| Low      | Custom alert - outbound connection created to an IP that isn't allowed                             | Agent       | An outbound connection was created to an IP that is outside your allowed IP list. |Investigate the device logs. Learn where the connection originated and determine if it is benign or malicious. If malicious, remove possible malware and understand source. If benign, add the source to the allowed IP list.                        |
| Low      | Custom alert - number of failed local logins is outside the allowed range                               | Agent       | The amount of failed local logins within a specific time window is outside the currently configured and allowable range. |   |
| Low      | Custom alert - login of a user that is not on the allowed user list | Agent       | A local user outside your allowed user list, logged in to the device.|  If you are saving raw data, navigate to your log analytics account and use the data to investigate the device, identify the source and then fix the allow/block list for those settings. If you are not currently saving raw data, go to the device and fix the allow/block list for those settings.|
| Low      | Custom alert - a process was executed that is not allowed | Agent       | A process that is not allowed was executed on the device. |If you are saving raw data, navigate to your log analytics account and use the data to investigate the device, identify the source and then fix the allow/block list for those settings. If you are not currently saving raw data, go to the device and fix the allow/block list for those settings.  |
