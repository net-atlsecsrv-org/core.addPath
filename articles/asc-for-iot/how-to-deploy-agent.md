# Select and deploy a security agent on your IoT device

Azure Security Center for IoT provides reference architectures for security agents that monitor and collect data from IoT devices.
To learn more, see [Security agent reference architecture](security-agent-architecture.md).

Agents are developed as open-source projects, and are available in two flavors: <br> [C](https://aka.ms/iot-security-github-c), and [C#](https://aka.ms/iot-security-github-cs).

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Compare security agent flavors
> * Discover supported agent platforms
> * Choose the right agent flavor for your solution

## Understand security agent options

Every Azure Security Center for IoT security agent flavor offers the same set of features, and supports similar configuration options.

The C-based security agent has a lower memory footprint, and is the ideal choice for devices with fewer available resources.

## Security agent installation guidelines

For **Windows**:
The Install SecurityAgent.ps1 script must be executed from an Administrator PowerShell window.

For **Linux**:
The InstallSecurityAgent.sh must be run as superuser. We recommend prefixing the installation command with "sudo".

## Choose an agent flavor

Answer the following questions about your IoT devices to select the correct agent:

- Are you using _Windows Server_ or _Windows IoT Core_?

    [Deploy a C#-based security agent for Windows](how-to-deploy-windows-cs.md).

- Are you using a Linux distribution with x86 architecture?

    [Deploy a C-based security agent for Linux](how-to-deploy-linux-c.md).

- Are you using a Linux distribution with x64 architecture?

    Both agent flavors can be used. <br>
    [Deploy a C-based security agent for Linux](how-to-deploy-linux-c.md) and/or
    [Deploy a C#-based security agent for Linux](how-to-deploy-linux-cs.md).

Both agent flavors offer the same set of features and support similar configuration options.
See [Security agent comparison](how-to-deploy-agent.md#understand-security-agent-options) to learn more.
