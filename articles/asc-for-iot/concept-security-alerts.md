# Azure Security Center for IoT security alerts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Security Center for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Security Center (ASC) for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity.
In addition, you can create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior.
An alert acts as an indicator of comprise, and should be investigated and remediated.

In this article, you will find a list of built-in alerts which can be triggered on your IoT Hub and/or IoT devices.
Beside built-in alert, ASC for IoT allows you to define custom alerts based on expected Hub and/or device behavior.
For more details, see [Create custom alerts](quickstart-create-custom-alerts.md).

| High     | Binary Command Line                                    | Agent       | Linux binary called or executed from the command-line detected. This process may be legitimate activity, or may be an indication that your device is compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Attackers will often disable the on-host firewall to exfiltrate data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| High     | Web shell                                              | Agent       | Possible use of a web shell detected. Attackers typically upload a web shell to a compromised machine for the purpose of gaining persistence in your environment or for further exploitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| High     | Port forwarding                                        | Agent       | Detected initiation of port forwarding to an external IP address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| High     | Possible attempt to disable Auditd logging detected    | Agent       | Linux Auditd system provides a way to track security-relevant system information. Auditd records as much information as possible about the events that are happening on your system.  Auditd information is crucial for mission-critical environments to be able to determine the violator of the security policy, and understand the actions they performed. Disabling auditd logging can halt discovery of violations of the security policies used on the system. |

Suspicious extensions can trick users into thinking files are safe to open, and may indicate the presence of malware on the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Medium   | Exposed Docker daemon by TCP socket                    | Agent       | Machine logs indicate that your Docker daemon (dockerd) exposes a TCP socket. By default, Docker configuration, does not use encryption or authentication when a TCP socket is enabled. Your exposed TCP socket enables full access to anyone with access to the relevant port, to the Docker daemon.                                                                                                                                                          |

| Medium   | Privileged Container Detected                          | Agent       | Machine logs indicate that a privileged Docker container is running. A privileged container has a full access to the host's resources. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the host machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Medium   | Mismatch between script interpreter and file extension | Agent       | Analysis of host data detected a mismatch between the script interpreter and the extension of the script file provided as input. This has frequently been associated with attacker script executions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
