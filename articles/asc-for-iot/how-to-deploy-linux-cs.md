# Deploy Azure Security Center for IoT C#-based security agent for Linux

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Security Center for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This guide explains how to install and deploy the Azure Security Center (ASC) for IoT C#-based security agent on Linux.

In this guide, you learn how to: 
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Install
> * Verify deployment
> * Uninstall the agent
> * Troubleshoot 

## Prerequisites

For other platforms and agent flavors, see [Choose the right security agent](how-to-deploy-agent.md).

1. To deploy the security agent, local admin rights are required on the machine you wish to install on. 

1. [Create a security module](quickstart-create-security-twin.md) for the device.

## Installation 

To deploy the security agent, do the following:

1. Download the most recent version to your machine from [Github](https://aka.ms/iot-security-github-cs).

1. Extract the contents of the package and navigate to the _/Install_ folder.

1. Add running permissions to the **InstallSecurityAgent script** by running `chmod +x InstallSecurityAgent.sh` 

1. Next, run: 

   ```
   ./InstallSecurityAgent.sh -i -aui <authentication identity>  -aum <authentication method> -f <file path> -hn <host name>  -di <device id> -cl <certificate location kind>
   ```
   
   See [How to configure authentication](concept-security-agent-authentication-methods.md) for more information about authentication parameters.

This script does the following:

- Installs prerequisites.

- Adds a service user (with interactive login disabled).

- Installs the agent as a **Daemon** - this assumes the device uses **systemd** for service management.

- Configures **sudoers** to allow the agent to perform certain tasks as root.

- Configures the agent with the provided authentication parameters.


For additional help, run the script with the –help parameter: `./InstallSecurityAgent.sh --help`

### Uninstall the agent

To uninstall the agent, run the script with the –u parameter: `./InstallSecurityAgent.sh -u`. 

> [!NOTE]
> Uninstall does not remove any missing prerequisites that were installed during installation.

## Troubleshooting  

1. Check the deployment status by running:

    `systemctl status ASCIoTAgent.service`

2. Enable logging.  
   If the agent fails to start, turn on logging to get more information.

   Turn on the logging by:

   1. Open the configuration file for editing in any Linux editor:

        `vi /var/ASCIoTAgent/General.config`

   1. Edit the following values: 

      ```
      <add key="logLevel" value="Debug"/>
      <add key="fileLogLevel" value="Debug"/>
      <add key="diagnosticVerbosityLevel" value="Some" /> 
      <add key="logFilePath" value="IotAgentLog.log"/>
      ```
       The **logFilePath** value is configurable. 

       > [!NOTE]
       > We recommend turning logging **off** after troubleshooting is complete. Leaving logging **on** increases log file size and data usage.

   1. Restart the agent by running:

       `systemctl restart ASCIoTAgent.service`

   1. View the log file for more information about the failure.  

       Log file location is: `/var/ASCIoTAgent/IotAgentLog.log`

       Change the file location path according to the name you chose for the **logFilePath** in step 2.
