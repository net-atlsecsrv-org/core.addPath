# Quickstart: Onboard Azure Security Center for IoT service in IoT Hub

This article provides an explanation of how to enable the Azure Security Center for IoT service on your existing IoT Hub. If you don't currently have an IoT Hub, see [Create an IoT Hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) to get started. 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Security Center for IoT currently only supports standard tier IoT Hubs.


## Prerequisites for enabling the service

- Log Analytics workspace
  - Two types of information are stored by default in your Log Analytics workspace by Azure Security Center for IoT; **security alerts** and **recommendations**. 
  - You can choose to add storage of an additional information type, **raw events**. Note that storing **raw events** in Log Analytics carries additional storage costs. 
- IoT Hub (standard tier)
- Meet all [service prerequisites](service-prerequisites.md) 

## Enable Azure Security Center for IoT on your IoT Hub 

To enable security on your IoT Hub: 

1. Open your **IoT Hub** in Azure portal. 
1. Under the **Security** menu, click **Secure your IoT solution**.    


Congratulations! You've completed enabling Azure Security Center for IoT on your IoT Hub. 

### Geolocation and IP address handling

To secure your IoT solution, IP addresses of incoming and outgoing connections to and from your IoT devices, IoT Edge, and IoT Hub(s) are collected and stored by default. This information is essential to detect abnormal connectivity from suspicious IP sources. For example, when attempts are made to establish connections from an IP source of a known botnet or from an IP source outside your geolocation. Azure Security Center for IoT service offers the flexibility to enable and disable collection of IP address data at any time. 

To enable or disable collection of IP address data: 

1. Open your IoT Hub and then select **Overview** from the **Security** menu. 
2. Choose the **Settings** screen and modify the geolocation and/or IP handling settings as you wish.

### Log Analytics creation

When Azure Security Center for IoT is turned on, a default Azure Log Analytics workspace is created to store raw security events, alerts, and recommendations for your IoT devices, IoT Edge, and IoT Hub. Each month, the first five (5) GB of data ingested per customer to the Azure Log Analytics service  is free. Every GB of data ingested into your Azure Log Analytics workspace is retained at no charge for the first 31 days. Learn more about [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) pricing.

To change the workspace configuration of Log Analytics:

1. Open your IoT Hub and then select **Overview** from the **Security** menu. 
2. Choose the **Settings** screen and modify the workspace configuration of Log Analytics settings as you wish.

### Customize your IoT security solution
By default, turning on the Azure Security Center for IoT solution automatically secures all IoT Hubs under your Azure subscription. 

To turn Azure Security Center for IoT service on a specific IoT Hub on or off: 

1. Open your IoT Hub and then select **Overview** from the **Security** menu. 
2. Choose the **Settings** screen and modify the security settings of any IoT hub in your Azure subscription as you wish.
