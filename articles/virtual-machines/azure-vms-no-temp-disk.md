# Azure VM sizes with no local temporary disk 
This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Azure VM sizes that do not have a local temporary disk (i.e. no local temp disk). For more information on these VM sizes, see [Specifications for Dv4 and Dsv4-series (General Purpose Workloads)](dv4-dsv4-series.md) or [Specifications for Ev4 and Esv4-series (Memory Optimized Workloads)](ev4-esv4-series.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dv4, Dsv4, Ev4 and Esv4-series VM sizes are now in Public Preview. To sign up for Public Preview, fill out this [Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_Y3toRKxchLjARedqtguBRURE1ZSkdDUzg1VzJDN0cwWUlKTkcyUlo5Mi4u). 

## What does no local temp disk mean? 
Traditionally, we have had VM sizes (e.g. Standard_D2s_v3, Standard_E48_v3) that include a small local disk (i.e. a D: Drive). Now with these new VM sizes, that small local disk no longer exists; however, you can still attach Standard HDD, Premium SSD or Ultra SSD.

## What if I still want a local temp disk?
If your workload requires a local temporary disk, we also have new [Ddv4 and Ddsv4](ddv4-ddsv4-series.md) or [Edv4 and Edsv4](edv4-edsv4-series.md) VM sizes available. These sizes offer 50% larger temporary disk compared with the previous v3 sizes.

> [!NOTE]
> Local temporary disk is not persistent; to ensure your data is persistent, please use Standard HDD, Premium SSD or Ultra SSD options. 

## What are the differences between these new VM sizes and the General Purpose Dv3/Dsv3 or the Memory Optimized Ev3/Esv3 VM sizes that I am used to? 
| v3 VM families with local temp disk	| New v4 families with local temp disk | New v4 families with no local temp disk |
|---|---|---|
| Dv3	| Ddv4 | Dv4 |
| Dsv3 | Ddsv4  | Dsv4 |
| Ev3	| Edv4  | Ev4 |
| Esv3 | Edsv4 |	Esv4 | 

## Can I resize a VM size that has a local temp disk to a VM size with no local temp disk?  
No. The only combinations allowed for resizing are: 

1. VM (with local temp disk) -> VM (with local temp disk); and 
2. VM (with no local temp disk) -> VM (with no local temp disk). 

> [!NOTE]
> If an image depends on the resource disk, or a pagefile or swapfile exists on the local temp disk, the diskless images will not work—instead, use the ‘with disk’ alternative. 

## Do these VM sizes support both Linux and Windows Operating Systems (OS)?
Yes.

## Will this break my custom scripts, custom images or OS images that have scratch files or page files on a local temp disk?
If the custom OS image points to the local temp disk, the image might not work correctly with this diskless size.
