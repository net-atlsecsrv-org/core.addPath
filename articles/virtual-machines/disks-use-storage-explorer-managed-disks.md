# Use Azure Storage Explorer to manage Azure managed disks

Storage Explorer 1.10.0 enables users to upload, download, and copy managed disks, as well as create snapshots. Because of these additional capabilities, you can use Storage Explorer to migrate data from on-premises to Azure, and migrate data across Azure regions.

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you'll need the following:
- An Azure subscription
- One or more Azure managed disks
- The latest version of [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)

## Connect to an Azure subscription

If your Storage Explorer isn't connected to Azure, you will not be able to use it to manage resources. This section goes over connecting it to your Azure account so that you can manage resources using Storage Explorer.

1. Launch Azure Storage Explorer and click the **plug-in** icon on the left.
