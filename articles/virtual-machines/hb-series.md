# HB-series

HB-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by memory bandwidth, such as fluid dynamics, explicit finite element analysis, and weather modeling. HB VMs feature 60 AMD EPYC 7551 processor cores, 4 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no simultaneous multithreading. An HB VM provides up to 260 GB/sec of memory bandwidth.
