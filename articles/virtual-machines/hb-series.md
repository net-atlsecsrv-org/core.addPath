# HB-series

HB-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by memory bandwidth, such as fluid dynamics, explicit finite element analysis, and weather modeling. HB VMs feature 60 AMD EPYC 7551 processor cores, 4 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no simultaneous multithreading. An HB VM provides up to 260 GB/sec of memory bandwidth.

HB-series VMs feature 100 Gb/sec Mellanox EDR InfiniBand. These VMs are connected in a non-blocking fat tree for optimized and consistent RDMA performance. These VMs support Adaptive Routing and the Dynamic Connected Transport (DCT, in additional to standard RC and UD transports). These features enhance application performance, scalability, and consistency, and usage of them is strongly recommended.
