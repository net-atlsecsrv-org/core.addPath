# List, update, and delete image resources 

You can manage your shared image gallery resources using the Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-gallery-list-cli.md](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-gallery-list-cli.md)]

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-shared-images-update-delete-cli](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-shared-images-update-delete-cli.md)]

## Next steps

[Azure Image Builder (preview)](./linux/image-builder-overview.md) can help automate image version creation, you can even use it to update and [create a new image version from an existing image version](./linux/image-builder-gallery-update-image-version.md).
