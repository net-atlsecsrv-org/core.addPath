# NCv3-series

NCv3-series VMs are powered by [NVIDIA Tesla V100](https://www.nvidia.com/data-center/tesla-v100/) GPUs. These GPUs can provide 1.5x the computational performance of the NCv2-series. Customers can take advantage of these updated GPUs for traditional HPC workloads such as reservoir modeling, DNA sequencing, protein analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and others. The NC24rs v3 configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads. In addition to the GPUs, the NCv3-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 (Broadwell) CPUs.

Premium Storage:  Supported

Premium Storage caching:  Supported

Live Migration: Not Supported

Memory Preserving Updates: Not Supported

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this VM series, the vCPU (core) quota in your subscription is initially set to 0 in each region. [Request a vCPU quota increase](../azure-supportability/resource-manager-core-quotas-request.md) for this series in an [available region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed.

The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) for supported operating systems and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](./extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-driver-setup.md) or [N-series GPU driver setup for Linux](./linux/n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.
