# Dv4 and Dsv4-series

The Dv4 and Dsv4-series runs on the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. It features a sustained all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz.

## Dv4-series

Dv4-series sizes run on the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake). The Dv4-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory and remote storage options for most production workloads. Dv4-series VMs feature [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html).

Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium storage disks, use the Dsv4 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Dsv4 sizes are the same as Dv4-series.
