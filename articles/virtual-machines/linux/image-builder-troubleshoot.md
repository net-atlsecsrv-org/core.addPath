# Troubleshoot Azure Image Builder Service

This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve common issues you may encounter when using Azure Image Builder Service.

AIB failures can happen in 2 areas:
- Image Template submission
- Image Build

## Troubleshoot image template submission errors

Image template submission errors are returned at submission only. There isn't an error log for image template submission errors. If there was an error during submission, you can return the error by checking the status of the template, specifically reviewing the `ProvisioningState` and `ProvisioningErrorMessage`/`provisioningError`.

```azurecli
az image builder show --name $imageTemplateName  --resource-group $imageResourceGroup
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzImageBuilderTemplate -ImageTemplateName  <imageTemplateName> -ResourceGroupName <imageTemplateResourceGroup> | Select-Object ProvisioningState, ProvisioningErrorMessage
```
> [!NOTE]
> For PowerShell, you will need to install the [Azure Image Builder PowerShell Modules](../windows/image-builder-powershell.md#prerequisites).

The following sections include problem resolution guidance for common image template submission errors.

### Update/Upgrade of image templates is currently not supported

#### Error

```text
'Conflict'. Details: Update/Upgrade of image templates is currently not supported
```

#### Cause

The template already exists.

#### Solution

If you submit an image configuration template and the submission fails, a failed template artifact still exists. Delete the failed template.

### The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'

#### Error

```text
Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates 'helloImageTemplateforSIG01' failed with message '{
  "status": "Failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "ResourceDeploymentFailure",
    "message": "The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "InternalOperationError",
        "message": "Internal error occurred."
```
#### Cause

In most cases, the resource deployment failure error occurs due to missing permissions.

#### Solution

Depending on your scenario, Azure Image Builder may need permissions to:
- Source image or Shared Image Gallery resource group
- Distribution image or Shared Image Gallery resource
- The storage account, container, or blob that the File customizer is accessing. 

For more information on configuring permissions, see [Configure Azure Image Builder Service permissions using Azure CLI](image-builder-permissions-cli.md) or [Configure Azure Image Builder Service permissions using PowerShell](image-builder-permissions-powershell.md)

### Error getting managed image

#### Error

```text
Build (Managed Image) step failed: Error getting Managed Image '/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/mymanagedmg1': Error getting managed image (...): compute.
ImagesClient#Get: Failure responding to request: StatusCode=403 -- Original Error: autorest/azure: Service returned an error.
Status=403 Code="AuthorizationFailed" Message="The client '......' with object id '......' does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Compute/images/read' over scope 
```
#### Cause

Missing permissions.

#### Solution

Depending on your scenario, Azure Image Builder may need permissions to:
* Source image or Shared Image Gallery resource group
* Distribution image or Shared Image Gallery resource
* The storage account, container, or blob that the File customizer is accessing. 

For more information on configuring permissions, see [Configure Azure Image Builder Service permissions using Azure CLI](image-builder-permissions-cli.md) or [Configure Azure Image Builder Service permissions using PowerShell](image-builder-permissions-powershell.md)

### Build  step failed for image version

#### Error
```text
Build (Shared Image Version) step failed for Image Version '/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/.../images/... /versions/0.23768.4001': Error getting Image Version '/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/.../images/.../versions/0.23768.4001': Error getting image version '... :0.23768.4001': compute.GalleryImageVersionsClient#Get: Failure responding to request: StatusCode=404 -- Original Error: autorest/azure: Service returned an error. 
Status=404 Code="ResourceNotFound" Message="The Resource 'Microsoft.Compute/galleries/.../images/.../versions/0.23768.4001' under resource group '<rgName>' was not found."
```
#### Cause

Azure Image Builder cannot locate the source image.

#### Solution

Ensure the source image is correct and exists in the location of the Azure Image Builder Service.

### Downloading external file to local file

#### Error

```text
Downloading external file (<myFile>) to local file (xxxxx.0.customizer.fp) [attempt 1 of 10] failed: Error downloading '<myFile>' to 'xxxxx.0.customizer.fp'..
```

#### Cause

The file name or location is incorrect, or the location is not reachable.

#### Solution

Ensure the file is reachable. Verify the name and location are correct.

## Troubleshoot build failures

For image build failures, you can get the error from the `lastrunstatus`, and then review the details in the customization.log.


```azurecli
az image builder show --name $imageTemplateName  --resource-group $imageResourceGroup
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzImageBuilderTemplate -ImageTemplateName  <imageTemplateName> -ResourceGroupName <imageTemplateResourceGroup> | Select-Object LastRunStatus, LastRunStatusMessage
```

### Customization log

When the image build is running, logs are created and stored in a storage account. Azure Image Builder creates the storage account in the temporary resource group when you create an image template artifact.

The storage account name uses the following pattern: **IT_\<ImageResourceGroupName\>_\<TemplateName\>_\<GUID\>**

For example, *IT_aibmdi_helloImageTemplateLinux01*.

You can view the customization.log in storage account in the resource group by selecting **Storage Account** > **Blobs** > `packerlogs`.  Then select **directory > customization.log**.


### Understanding the customization log

The log is verbose. It covers the image build including any issues with the image distribution, such as Shared Image Gallery replication. These errors are surfaced in the error message of the image template status.

The customization.log includes the following stages:

1. Deploy the build VM and dependencies using ARM templates to the IT_ staging resource group stage. This stage includes multiple POSTs to the Azure Image Builder resource provider:
    ```text
    Azure request method="POST" request="https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subID>/resourceGroups/IT_aibImageRG200_window2019VnetTemplate01_dec33089-1cc3-cccc-cccc-ccccccc/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
    ..
    PACKER OUT ==> azure-arm: Deploying deployment template ...
    ..
    ```

2. Status of the deployments stage. This stage includes status of each resource deployment:
    ```text
    PACKER ERR 2020/04/30 23:28:50 packer: 2020/04/30 23:28:50 Azure request method="GET" request="https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subID>/resourcegroups/IT_aibImageRG200_window2019VnetTemplate01_dec33089-1cc3-4505-ae28-6661e43fac48/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/pkrdp51lc0339jg/operationStatuses/08586133176207523519?[REDACTED]" body=""
    ```

3. Connect to the build VM stage.

    If Windows, the Azure Image Builder Service connects using WinRM:
    ```text
    PACKER ERR 2020/04/30 23:30:50 packer: 2020/04/30 23:30:50 Waiting for WinRM, up to timeout: 10m0s
    ..
    PACKER OUT     azure-arm: WinRM connected.
    ```

    If Linux, the Azure Image Builder Service will connect using SSH:
    ```text
    PACKER OUT ==> azure-arm: Waiting for SSH to become available...
    PACKER ERR 2019/12/10 17:20:51 packer: 2020/04/10 17:20:51 [INFO] Waiting for SSH, up to timeout: 20m0s
    PACKER OUT ==> azure-arm: Connected to SSH!
    ```

4. Run customizations stage. When customizations run, you can identify them by reviewing the customization.log. Search for *(telemetry)*.
    ```text
    (telemetry) Starting provisioner windows-update
    (telemetry) ending windows-update
    (telemetry) Starting provisioner powershell
    (telemetry) ending powershell
    (telemetry) Starting provisioner file
    (telemetry) ending file
    (telemetry) Starting provisioner windows-restart
    (telemetry) ending windows-restart
    
    (telemetry) Finalizing. - This means the build hasfinished
    ```
5. De-provision stage. Azure Image Builder adds a hidden customizer. This de-provision step is responsible for preparing the VM for de-provisioning. It runs Windows Sysprep (using c:\DeprovisioningScript.ps1), or in Linux waagent deprovision (using /tmp/DeprovisioningScript.sh). 

    For example:
    ```text
    PACKER ERR 2020/03/04 23:05:04 [INFO] (telemetry) Starting provisioner powershell
    PACKER ERR 2020/03/04 23:05:04 packer: 2020/03/04 23:05:04 Found command: if( TEST-PATH c:\DeprovisioningScript.ps1 ){cat c:\DeprovisioningScript.ps1} else {echo "Deprovisioning script [c:\DeprovisioningScript.ps1] could not be found. Image build may fail or the VM created from the Image may not boot. Please make sure the deprovisioning script is not accidentally deleted by a Customizer in the Template."}
    ```

6. Clean up stage. Once the build has completed, Azure Image Builder resources are deleted.
    ```text
    PACKER ERR 2020/02/04 02:04:23 packer: 2020/02/04 02:04:23 Azure request method="DELETE" request="https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subId>/resourceGroups/IT_aibDevOpsImg_t_vvvvvvv_yyyyyy-de5f-4f7c-92f2-xxxxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/pkrnijamvpo08eo?[REDACTED]" body=""
    ```
## Tips for troubleshooting script/inline customization
- Test the code before supplying it to Image Builder
- Ensure Azure Policy's and Firewalls allow connectivity to remote resources.
- Output comments to the console, such as using `Write-Host` or `echo`, this will allow you to search the customization.log.

## Troubleshoot common build errors

### Packer build command failure

#### Error

```text
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "lastRunStatus": {
   "startTime": "2020-04-30T23:24:06.756985789Z",
   "endTime": "2020-04-30T23:39:14.268729811Z",
   "runState": "Failed",
   "message": "Failed while waiting for packerizer: Microservice has failed: Failed while processing request: Error when executing packerizer: Packer build command has failed: exit status 1. During the image build, a failure has occurred, please review the build log to identify which build/customization step failed. For more troubleshooting steps go to https://aka.ms/azvmimagebuilderts. Image Build log location: https://xxxxxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net/packerlogs/xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx/customization.log. OperationId: xxxxxx-5a8c-4379-xxxx-8d85493bc791. Use this operationId to search packer logs."
```

#### Cause

Customization failure.

#### Solution

Review log to locate customizers failures. Search for *(telemetry)*. 

For example:
```text
(telemetry) Starting provisioner windows-update
(telemetry) ending windows-update
(telemetry) Starting provisioner powershell
(telemetry) ending powershell
(telemetry) Starting provisioner file
(telemetry) ending file
(telemetry) Starting provisioner windows-restart
(telemetry) ending windows-restart

(telemetry) Finalizing. - This means the build has finished
```

### Timeout exceeded

#### Error

```text
Deployment failed. Correlation ID: xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx. Failed in building/customizing image: Failed while waiting for packerizer: Timeout waiting for microservice to complete: 'context deadline exceeded'
```

#### Cause

The build exceeded the build timeout. This error is seen in the 'lastrunstatus'.

#### Solution

1. Review the customization.log. Identify the last customizer to run. Search for `(telemetry)` starting from the bottom of the log. 

2. Check script customizations. The customizations may not be suppressing user interaction for commands, such as `quiet` options. For example, `apt-get install -y` results in the script execution waiting for user interaction.

3. If you are using the `File` customizer to download artifacts greater than 20 MB, see workarounds section.

4. Review errors and dependencies in script that may cause the script to wait.

5. If you expect that the customizations need more time, increase [buildTimeoutInMinutes](image-builder-json.md). The default is four hours.

6. If you have resource-intensive actions, such as downloading gigabytes of files, consider the underlying build VM size. The service uses a Standard_D1_v2 VM. The VM has, 1 vCPU and 3.5 GB of memory. If you are downloading 50 GB, this will likely exhaust the VM resources and cause communication failures between the Azure Image Builder Service and build VM. Retry the build with a larger memory VM, by setting the [VM_Size](image-builder-json.md#vmprofile).

### Long file download time

#### Error
```text

[086cf9c4-0457-4e8f-bfd4-908cfe3fe43c] PACKER OUT 
```
#### Cause 

File customizer is downloading a large file.

#### Solution

The file customizer is only suitable for small file downloads less than 20 MB. For larger file downloads, use a script or inline command. For example, on Linux you can use `wget` or `curl`. On Windows, you can use`Invoke-WebRequest`.

### Error waiting on shared image gallery

#### Error

```text
Deployment failed. Correlation ID: XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX. Failed in distributing 1 images out of total 1: {[Error 0] [Distribute 0] Error publishing MDI to shared image gallery:/subscriptions/<subId>/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/xxxxx/images/xxxxxx, Location:eastus. Error: Error returned from SIG client while publishing MDI to shared image gallery for dstImageLocation: eastus, dstSubscription: <subId>, dstResourceGroupName: XXXXXX, dstGalleryName: XXXXXX, dstGalleryImageName: XXXXXX. Error: Error waiting on shared image gallery future for resource group: XXXXXX, gallery name: XXXXXX, gallery image name: XXXXXX.Error: Future#WaitForCompletion: context has been cancelled: StatusCode=200 -- Original Error: context deadline exceeded}
```

#### Cause

Image Builder timed out waiting for the image to be added and replicated to the Shared Image Gallery (SIG). If the image is being injected into the SIG, it can be assumed the image build was successful. However, the overall process failed, because the image builder was waiting on shared image gallery to complete the replication. Even though the build has failed, the replication continues. You can get the properties of the image version by checking the distribution *runOutput*.

```bash
$runOutputName=<distributionRunOutput>
az resource show \
    --ids "/subscriptions/$subscriptionID/resourcegroups/$imageResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates/$imageTemplateName/runOutputs/$runOutputName"  \
    --api-version=2019-05-01-preview
```

#### Solution

Increase the **buildTimeoutInMinutes**.
 
### Low Windows resource information events

#### Cause

Time out caused by waiting for required Azure resources to be created.

#### Solution

Rerun the build to try again.

### Resource not found

```
#### Cause

The cause may be a timing issue due to the D1_V2 VM size. If customizations are limited and execute in less than three seconds, sysprep commands are run by Azure Image Builder to de-provision. When Azure Image Builder de-provisions, the sysprep command checks for the *WindowsAzureGuestAgent*, which may not be fully installed causing the timing issue. 

#### Solution

Increase the VM size. Or, you can add a 60-second PowerShell sleep customization to avoid the timing issue.

```
#### Cause
Image Builder service uses port 22(Linux), or 5986(Windows)to connect to the build VM, this occurs when the service is disconnected from the build VM during an image build. Reasons for disconnection can vary, but enabling or configuring firewalls in script can block the ports above.

#### Solution
Review your scripts for firewall changes/enablement, or changes to SSH or WinRM, and ensure any changes allow for constant connectivity between the service and build VM on the ports above. For more information on Image Builder networking, please review the [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-networking).

## DevOps task 

### Troubleshooting the task
The task will only fail if an error occurs during customization, when this happens the task will report failure and leave the staging resource group, with the logs, so you can identify the issue. 

To locate the log, you need to know the template name, go into pipeline > failed build > drill into the AIB DevOps task, then you will see the log and a template name:
```text
start reading task parameters...
found build at:  /home/vsts/work/r1/a/_ImageBuilding/webapp
end reading parameters
getting storage account details for aibstordot1556933914
created archive /home/vsts/work/_temp/temp_web_package_21475337782320203.zip
Source for image:  { type: 'SharedImageVersion',
  imageVersionId: '/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<galleryName>/images/<imageDefName>/versions/<imgVersionNumber>' }
template name:  t_1556938436xxx
``` 

Go to the portal, search for the template name in resource group, then look for the resource group with IT_*.
Go to the storage account > blobs > containers > logs.

### Troubleshooting successful builds
There maybe some cases where you need to investigate successful builds, and want to review the log. As mentioned, if the image build is successful, the staging resource group that contains the logs will be deleted as part of the clean up. However, what you can do, is introduce a sleep after the inline command, then get the logs as the build is paused. To do this follow these steps:
 
1. Update the inline command, and add:
Write-Host / Echo “Sleep” – this will allow you to search in the log
2. Add a sleep for at least 10mins, you can use [Start-Sleep](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/start-sleep), or `Sleep` Linux command.
3. Use the method above to identify the log location, and then keep downloading/checking the log until it gets to the sleep.

```
#### Cause

If the build was not canceled by a user, it was canceled by Azure DevOps User Agent. Most likely the 1-hour timeout has occurred due to Azure DevOps capabilities. If you are using a private project and agent, you get 60 minutes of build time. If the build exceeds the timeout, DevOps cancels the running task.

For more information on Azure DevOps capabilities and limitations, see [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops#capabilities-and-limitations)
 
#### Solution

You can host your own DevOps agents, or look to reduce the time of your build. For example, if you are distributing to the shared image gallery, replicate to one region. If you want to replicate asynchronously. 

### Slow Windows Logon: 'Please wait for the Windows Modules Installer'

#### Error
After you create a Windows 10 image with Image Builder, then create a VM from the image, you RDP, and have to wait minutes at the first logon seeing a blue screen with the message:
```text
Please wait for the Windows Modules Installer
```

#### Solution
Firstly in the image build check that there are no outstanding reboots required by adding a Windows Restart customizer as the last customization, and that all software installation is complete. Lastly, add [/mode:vm](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep-command-line-options) option to the default sysprep that AIB uses, see below, 'VMs created from AIB images do not create successfully' > 'Overriding the Commands'  

 
## VMs created from AIB images do not create successfully

By default, the Azure Image Builder runs *de-provision* code at the end of each image customization phase to *generalize* the image. Generalize is a process where the image is set up to be reused to create multiple VMs and you can pass in VM settings, such as hostname, username, etc. For Windows, Azure Image Builder executes *Sysprep*, and for Linux Azure Image Builder runs `waagent -deprovision`. 

For Windows, Azure Image Builder uses a generic Sysprep command. However, this may not be suitable for every successful Windows generalization. Azure Image Builder allows you to customize the Sysprep command. Note Azure Image Builder is an image automation tool. It's responsible for running Sysprep command successfully. But, you may need different Sysprep commands to make your image reusable. For Linux, Azure Image Builder uses a generic `waagent -deprovision+user` command. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Linux Agent documentation](https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent#command-line-options).

If you are migrating an existing customization and you are using different Sysprep/waagent commands, you can try the image builder generic commands. If the VM creation fails, use your previous Sysprep/waagent commands.

> [!NOTE]
> If AIB creates a Windows custom image successfully, and you create a VM from it then find the VM will not create successfully (For example, the VM creation command does not complete/timeouts), you will need to review the Windows Server Sysprep documentation. Or, you can raise a support request with the Windows Server Sysprep Customer Services Support team, who can troubleshoot and advise on the correct Sysprep command.

### Command Locations and Filenames

Windows:

```
c:\DeprovisioningScript.ps1
```

Linux:
```bash
/tmp/DeprovisioningScript.sh
```

### Sysprep Command: Windows

```PowerShell
Write-Output '>>> Waiting for GA Service (RdAgent) to start ...'
while ((Get-Service RdAgent).Status -ne 'Running') { Start-Sleep -s 5 }
Write-Output '>>> Waiting for GA Service (WindowsAzureTelemetryService) to start ...'
while ((Get-Service WindowsAzureTelemetryService) -and ((Get-Service WindowsAzureTelemetryService).Status -ne 'Running')) { Start-Sleep -s 5 }
Write-Output '>>> Waiting for GA Service (WindowsAzureGuestAgent) to start ...'
while ((Get-Service WindowsAzureGuestAgent).Status -ne 'Running') { Start-Sleep -s 5 }
Write-Output '>>> Sysprepping VM ...'
if( Test-Path $Env:SystemRoot\system32\Sysprep\unattend.xml ) {
  Remove-Item $Env:SystemRoot\system32\Sysprep\unattend.xml -Force
}
& $Env:SystemRoot\System32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe /oobe /generalize /quiet /quit
while($true) {
  $imageState = (Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\State).ImageState
  Write-Output $imageState
  if ($imageState -eq 'IMAGE_STATE_GENERALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE') { break }
  Start-Sleep -s 5
}
Write-Output '>>> Sysprep complete ...'
```

### Deprovision Command: Linux

```bash
/usr/sbin/waagent -force -deprovision+user && export HISTSIZE=0 && sync
```

### Overriding the Commands

To override the commands, use the PowerShell or shell script provisioners to create the command files with the exact file name and put them in the directories listed previously. Azure Image Builder reads these commands and output is written to the *customization.log*.
