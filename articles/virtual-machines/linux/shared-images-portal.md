#Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn about how to create shared VM images to minimize the number of post-deployment configuration tasks.

# Create a shared image gallery using the Azure portal

A [Shared Image Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md) simplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap deployment tasks like preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. 

The Shared Image Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others in your organization, within or across regions, within an AAD tenant. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group shared images. 

The gallery is a top-level resource that provides full role-based access control (RBAC). Images can be versioned, and you can choose to replicate each image version to a different set of Azure regions. The gallery only works with Managed Images.

The Shared Image Gallery feature has multiple resource types. We will be using or building these in this article:

| Resource | Description|
|----------|------------|
| **Managed image** | This is a basic image that can be used alone or used to create an **image version** in an image gallery. Managed images are created from generalized VMs. A managed image is a special type of VHD that can be used to make multiple VMs and can now be used to create shared image versions. |
| **Image gallery** | Like the Azure Marketplace, an **image gallery** is a repository for managing and sharing images, but you control who has access. |
| **Image definition** | Images are defined within a gallery and carry information about the image and requirements for using it internally. This includes whether the image is Windows or Linux, release notes, and minimum and maximum memory requirements. It is a definition of a type of image. |
| **Image version** | An **image version** is what you use to create a VM when using a gallery. You can have multiple versions of an image as needed for your environment. Like a managed image, when you use an **image version** to create a VM, the image version is used to create new disks for the VM. Image versions can be used multiple times. |


## Before you begin

To complete the example in this article, you must have an existing managed image. You can follow [Tutorial: Create a custom image of an Azure VM with Azure PowerShell](tutorial-custom-images.md) to create one if needed. If the managed image contains a data disk, the data disk size cannot be more than 1 TB.

When working through this article, replace the resource group and VM names where needed.

 
[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-shared-images-portal](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-shared-images-portal.md)]

## Create VMs from an image

Once the image version is complete, you can create one or more new VMs. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot use the portal to deploy a VM from an image in another azure tenant. To create a VM from an image shared between tenants, you must use the [Azure CLI](shared-images.md#create-a-vm) or [Powershell](../windows/shared-images.md#create-vms-from-an-image).


This example creates a VM named *myVMfromImage*, in the *myResourceGroup* in the *East US* datacenter.

1. On the page for your image version, select **Create VM** from the menu at the top of the page.
1. For **Resource group**, select **Create new** and type *myResourceGroup* for the name.
1. In **Virtual machine name**, type *myVM*.
1. For **Region**, select *East US*.
1. For **Availability options**, leave the default of *No infrastructure redundancy required*.
1. The value for **Image** should be automatically filled in if you started from the page for the image version.
1. For **Size**, choose a VM size from the list of available sizes and then click "Select".
1. Under **Administrator account**,  select **Password** or **SSH public key**, then enter your information.
1. If you want to allow remote access to the VM, under **Public inbound ports**, choose **Allow selected ports** and then select **SSH (22)** from the drop-down. If you don't want to allow remote access to the VM, leave **None** selected for **Public inbound ports**.
1. When you are finished, select the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.
1. After the VM passes validation, select **Create** at the bottom of the page to start the deployment.


## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the virtual machine, select **Delete**, then confirm the name of the resource group to delete.

If you want to delete individual resources, you need to delete them in reverse order. For example, to delete an image definition, you need to delete all of the image versions created from that image.

## Next steps

You can also create Shared Image Gallery resource using templates. There are several Azure Quickstart Templates available: 

- [Create a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-create/)
- [Create an Image Definition in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-definition-create/)
- [Create an Image Version in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-version-create/)
- [Create a VM from Image Version](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-vm-from-sig/)

For more information about Shared Image Galleries, see the [Overview](shared-image-galleries.md). If you run into issues, see [Troubleshooting shared image galleries](troubleshooting-shared-images.md).
