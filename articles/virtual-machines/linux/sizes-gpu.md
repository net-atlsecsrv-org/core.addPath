# GPU optimized virtual machine sizes

## Supported distributions and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs running Linux, NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed. The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](../extensions/hpccompute-gpu-linux.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as the Azure CLI or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](../extensions/hpccompute-gpu-linux.md) for supported distributions and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](../extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Linux](n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported distributions, drivers, and installation and verification steps.

* You shouldn't install X server or other systems that use the `Nouveau` driver on Ubuntu NC VMs. Before installing NVIDIA GPU drivers, you need to disable the `Nouveau` driver.
