# Configure prerequisites

Before using the Marketplace offer to deploy a self-managed OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 cluster in Azure, a few prerequisites must be configured.  Read the [OpenShift prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/openshift-container-platform-3x-prerequisites) article for instructions to create an ssh key (without a passphrase), Azure key vault, key vault secret, and a service principal.

 
## Deploy using the Marketplace offer

The simplest way to deploy a self-managed OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 cluster into Azure is to use the [Azure Marketplace offer](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/osatesting.open-shift-azure-proxy).

This option is the simplest, but it also has limited customization capabilities. The Marketplace offer deploys OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.82 and includes the following configuration options:

- **Master Nodes**: Three (3) Master Nodes with configurable instance type.
- **Infra Nodes**: Three (3) Infra Nodes with configurable instance type.
- **Nodes**: The number of Nodes (between 1 and 9) and the instance type are configurable.
- **Disk Type**: Managed Disks are used.
- **Networking**: Support for new or existing Network and custom CIDR range.
- **CNS**: CNS can be enabled.
- **Metrics**: Hawkular Metrics can be enabled.
- **Logging**: EFK Logging can be enabled.
- **Azure Cloud Provider**: Enabled by default, can be disabled.

In the upper left of the Azure portal, click **Create a resource**, enter 'openshift container platform' into the search box and hit Enter.

## Connect to the OpenShift cluster

When the deployment finishes, retrieve the connection from the output section of the deployment. Connect to the OpenShift console with your browser by using the **OpenShift Console URL**. you can also SSH to the Bastion host. Following is an example where the admin username is clusteradmin and the bastion public IP DNS FQDN is bastiondns4hawllzaavu6g.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:

```bash
$ ssh clusteradmin@bastiondns4hawllzaavu6g.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

## Clean up resources

Use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) command to remove the resource group, OpenShift cluster, and all related resources when they're no longer needed.

```azurecli 
az group delete --name openshiftrg
```
