# Azure Instance Metadata service

The Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides information about currently running virtual machine instances and can be used to manage and configure your virtual machines.
This includes the SKU, storage, network configurations, and upcoming maintenance events. For a complete list of the data that is available, see [metadata APIs](#metadata-apis). 
Instance Metadata Service is available for both the VM and virtual machine scale set Instances. It is only available for running VMs created/managed using [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/). 

Azure's Instance Metadata Service is a REST Endpoint that is available at a well-known non-routable IP address (`169.254.169.254`), it can be accessed only from within the VM.

## Security

The Instance Metadata Service endpoint is accessible only from within the running virtual machine instance on a non-routable IP address. In addition, any request with a `X-Forwarded-For` header is rejected by the service.
Requests must also contain a `Metadata: true` header to ensure that the actual request was directly intended and not a part of unintentional redirection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Instance Metadata Service is not a channel for sensitive data. The end point is open to all processes on the VM. Information exposed through this service should be considered as shared information to all applications running inside the VM.

## Usage

### Accessing Azure Instance Metadata Service

To access Instance Metadata Service, create a VM from [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/) or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and follow the samples below.
More examples of how to query IMDS can be found at [Azure Instance Metadata Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/azureimds).

Below is the sample code to retrieve all metadata for an instance, to access specific data source, see [Metadata API](#metadata-apis) section.

### Data output

By default, the Instance Metadata Service returns data in JSON format (`Content-Type: application/json`). However, different APIs return data in different formats if requested.
The following table is a reference of other data formats APIs may support.

API | Default Data Format | Other Formats
--------|---------------------|--------------
/instance | json | text
/scheduledevents | json | none
/attested | json | none

To access a non-default response format, specify the requested format as a query string parameter in the request. For example:

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2017-08-01&format=text"
```

> [!NOTE]
> For leaf nodes the `format=json` doesn't work. For these queries `format=text` needs to be explicitly specified if the default format is json.

### Versioning

The Instance Metadata Service is versioned and specifying the API version in the HTTP request is mandatory.

Follow are the supported service versions: 2017-04-02, 2017-08-01, 2017-12-01, 2018-02-01, 2018-04-02, 2018-10-01, 2019-02-01, 2019-03-11, 2019-04-30, 2019-06-01, 2019-06-04, 2019-08-01, 2019-08-15.

Note when new version is released, it will take a while to roll out to all regions. Currently version 2019-11-01 is still getting deployed and may not be available in all regions.

As newer versions are added, older versions can still be accessed for compatibility if your scripts have dependencies on specific data formats.

When no version is specified, an error is returned with a list of the newest supported versions.

> [!NOTE]
> The response is a JSON string. The following example indicates the error condition when version is not specified, the response is pretty-printed for readability.

**Request**

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance"
```

**Response**

```json
{
    "error": "Bad request. api-version was not specified in the request. For more information refer to aka.ms/azureimds",
    "newest-versions": [
        "2018-10-01",
        "2018-04-02",
        "2018-02-01"
    ]
}
```

### Sample 1: Tracking VM running on Azure

As a service provider, you may require to track the number of VMs running your software or have agents that need to track uniqueness of the VM. To be able to get a unique ID for a VM, use the `vmId` field from Instance Metadata Service.

**Request**

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/vmId?api-version=2017-08-01&format=text"
```

**Response**

```text
5c08b38e-4d57-4c23-ac45-aca61037f084
```

### Sample 2: Placement of containers, data-partitions based fault/update domain

For certain scenarios, placement of different data replicas is of prime importance. For example, [HDFS replica placement](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#Replica_Placement:_The_First_Baby_Steps)
or container placement via an [orchestrator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/) may you require to know the `platformFaultDomain` and `platformUpdateDomain` the VM is running on.
You can also use [Availability Zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md) for the instances to make these decisions.
You can query this data directly via the Instance Metadata Service.

**Request**

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/platformFaultDomain?api-version=2017-08-01&format=text"
```

**Response**

```text
0
```

### Sample 3: Getting more information about the VM during support case

As a service provider, you may get a support call where you would like to know more information about the VM. Asking the customer to share the compute metadata can provide basic information for the support professional to know about the kind of VM on Azure.

**Request**

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute?api-version=2019-06-01"
```

```

## Storage Metadata

Storage metadata is part of the instance API under instance/compute/storageProfile endpoint.
It provides details about the storage disks associated with the VM. 

The storage profile of a VM is divided into three categories - image reference, OS disk, and data disks.

The image reference object contains the following information about the OS image:

Data    | Description
--------|-----------------
id      | Resource ID
offer   | Offer of the platform or marketplace image
publisher | Image publisher
sku     | Image sku
version | Version of the platform or marketplace image

The OS disk object contains the following information about the OS disk used by the VM:

Data    | Description
--------|-----------------
caching | Caching requirements
createOption | Information about how the VM was created
diffDiskSettings | Ephemeral disk settings
diskSizeGB | Size of the disk in GB
image   | Source user image virtual hard disk
lun     | Logical unit number of the disk
managedDisk | Managed disk parameters
name    | Disk name
vhd     | Virtual hard disk
writeAcceleratorEnabled | Whether or not writeAccelerator is enabled on the disk

The data disks array contains a list of data disks attached to the VM. Each data disk object contains the following information:

Data    | Description
--------|-----------------
caching | Caching requirements
createOption | Information about how the VM was created
diffDiskSettings | Ephemeral disk settings
diskSizeGB | Size of the disk in GB
encryptionSettings | Encryption settings for the disk
image   | Source user image virtual hard disk
managedDisk | Managed disk parameters
name    | Disk name
osType  | Type of OS included in the disk
vhd     | Virtual hard disk
writeAcceleratorEnabled | Whether or not writeAccelerator is enabled on the disk

The following is an example of how to query the VM's storage information.

## VM Tags

VM tags are included the instance API under instance/compute/tags endpoint.
Tags may have been applied to your Azure VM to logically organize them into a taxonomy. The tags assigned to a VM can be retrieved by using the request below.

**Request**

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/tags?api-version=2018-10-01&format=text"
```

**Response**

```text
Department:IT;Environment:Test;Role:WebRole
```

The `tags` field is a string with the tags delimited by semicolons. This can be a problem if semicolons are used in the tags themselves. If a parser is written to programmatically extract the tags, you should rely on the `tagsList` field which is a JSON array with no delimiters, and consequently, easier to parse.

**Request**

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/tagsList?api-version=2019-06-04&format=json"
```

**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Department",
    "value": "IT"
  },
  {
    "name": "Environment",
    "value": "Test"
  },
  {
    "name": "Role",
    "value": "WebRole"
  }
]
```

## Attested Data

Part of the scenario served by Instance Metadata Service is to provide guarantees that the data provided is coming from Azure. We sign part of this information so that marketplace images can be sure that it's their image running on Azure.

### Sample 1: Getting attested Data

> [!NOTE]
> All API responses are JSON strings. The following example responses are pretty-printed for readability.

***Request***

```bash
curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/attested/document?api-version=2018-10-01&nonce=1234567890"

```

Api-version is a mandatory field. Refer to the [usage section](#usage) for supported API versions.
Nonce is an optional 10-digit string. If not provided, IMDS returns the current UTC timestamp in its place. Due to IMDS's caching mechanism, a previously cached nonce value may be returned.

 ***Response***

> [!NOTE]
> The response is a JSON string. The following example response is pretty-printed for readability.

```json

}
```

The signature blob is a [pkcs7](https://aka.ms/pkcs7) signed version of document. It contains the certificate used for signing along with the VM details like vmId, sku, nonce, subscriptionId, timeStamp for creation and expiry of the document and the plan information about the image. The plan information is only populated for Azure Marketplace images. The certificate can be extracted from the response and used to validate that the response is valid and is coming from Azure.

### Sample 2: Validating that the VM is running in Azure

Marketplace vendors want to ensure that their software is licensed to run only in Azure. If someone copies the VHD out to on-premise, then they should have the ability to detect that. By calling into Instance Metadata Service, Marketplace vendors can get signed data that guarantees response only from Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> Requires jq to be installed.

***Request***

```bash
  # Get the signature
   curl  --silent -H Metadata:True http://169.254.169.254/metadata/attested/document?api-version=2019-04-30 | jq -r '.["signature"]' > signature
  # Decode the signature
  base64 -d signature > decodedsignature
  #Get PKCS7 format
  openssl pkcs7 -in decodedsignature -inform DER -out sign.pk7
  # Get Public key out of pkc7
  openssl pkcs7 -in decodedsignature -inform DER  -print_certs -out signer.pem
  #Get the intermediate certificate
  wget -q -O intermediate.cer "$(openssl x509 -in signer.pem -text -noout | grep " CA Issuers -" | awk -FURI: '{print $2}')"
  openssl x509 -inform der -in intermediate.cer -out intermediate.pem
  #Verify the contents
  openssl smime -verify -in sign.pk7 -inform pem -noverify
 ```

 **Response**

```json
Verification successful
{"nonce":"20181128-001617",
  "plan":
    {
     "name":"",
     "product":"",

"subscriptionId": "xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx",
"sku": "RS3-Pro"
}
```

Data | Description
-----|------------
nonce | User supplied optional string with the request. If no nonce was supplied in the request, the current UTC timestamp is returned
plan | [Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/createorupdate#plan) for a VM in it's an Azure Marketplace Image, contains name, product, and publisher
timestamp/createdOn | The UTC timestamp at which the first signed document was created
timestamp/expiresOn | The UTC timestamp at which the signed document expires
vmId |  [Unique identifier](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/accessing-and-using-azure-vm-unique-id/) for the VM
subscriptionId | Azure subscription for the Virtual Machine, introduced in `2019-04-30`
sku | Specific SKU for the VM image, introduced in `2019-11-01`

#### Sample 3: Verifying the signature

Once you get the signature above, you can verify that the signature is from Microsoft. Also you can verify the intermediate certificate and the certificate chain. Lastly, you can verify the subscription ID is correct.

> [!NOTE]
> The certificate for Public cloud and sovereign cloud will be different.

 Cloud | Certificate
---------|-----------------
[All Generally Available Global Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)     | *.metadata.azure.com
[Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/government/)              | *.metadata.azure.us
[Azure China 21Vianet](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/china/)         | *.metadata.azure.cn
[Azure Germany](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/germany/)                    | *.metadata.microsoftazure.de

There is a known issue around the certificate used for signing. The certificates may not have an exact match of `metadata.azure.com` for public cloud. Hence the certification validation should allow a common name from any `.metadata.azure.com` subdomain.

```bash

# Verify the subject name for the main certificate
openssl x509 -noout -subject -in signer.pem
# Verify the issuer for the main certificate
openssl x509 -noout -issuer -in signer.pem
#Validate the subject name for intermediate certificate
openssl x509 -noout -subject -in intermediate.pem
# Verify the issuer for the intermediate certificate
openssl x509 -noout -issuer -in intermediate.pem
# Verify the certificate chain, for Azure China 21Vianet the intermediate certificate will be from DigiCert Global Root CA
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile /etc/ssl/certs/Baltimore_CyberTrust_Root.pem -untrusted intermediate.pem signer.pem
```

In cases where the intermediate certificate cannot be downloaded due to network constraints during validation, the intermediate certificate can be pinned. However, Azure will roll over the certificates as per standard PKI practice. The pinned certificates would need to be updated when rollover happens. Whenever a change to update the intermediate certificate is planned, the Azure blog will be updated and Azure customers will be notified. The intermediate certificates can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/pki/mscorp/cps/default.htm). The intermediate certificates for each of the regions can be different.

> [!NOTE]
>The intermediate certificate for Azure China 21Vianet will be from DigiCert Global Root CA instead of Baltimore.
Also if you had pinned the intermediate certificates for Azure China as part of root chain authority change, the intermediate certificates will have to be updated.

## Managed Identity via Metadata Service
User can enable the managed identity on a VM, and then leverage Instance Metadata Service to pass the token for accessing Azure services. Applications running on a VM now can request a token from the Azure Instance Metadata service endpoint, and then use the token to authenticate to cloud services, including key vault.
For detailed steps to enable this feature, see [Acquire an access token](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token.md).

## Scheduled Events via Metadata Service
You can obtain the status of the scheduled events via metadata service, then user can specify a set of action to execute upon these events.  See [Scheduled Events](scheduled-events.md) for details. 

## Regional Availability

The service is **generally available** in all Azure regions. This includes: 
1. [All Generally Available Global Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)
2. [Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/government/)  
3. [Azure China 21Vianet](https://www.azure.cn/) 
4. [Azure Germany](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/germany/)

## Error and Debugging

If there is a data element not found or a malformed request, the Instance Metadata Service returns standard HTTP errors. For example:

HTTP Status Code | Reason
----------------|-------
200 OK |
400 Bad Request | Missing `Metadata: true` header or missing the format when querying a leaf node
404 Not Found | The requested element doesn't exist
405 Method Not Allowed | Only `GET` requests are supported
410 Gone | Retry after some time for a max of 70 seconds
429 Too Many Requests | The API currently supports a maximum of 5 queries per second
500 Service Error     | Retry after some time

### Known issues and FAQ

1. I am getting the error `400 Bad Request, Required metadata header not specified`. What does this mean?
   * The Instance Metadata Service requires the header `Metadata: true` to be passed in the request. Passing this header in the REST call allows access to the Instance Metadata Service.
2. Why am I not getting compute information for my VM?
   * Currently the Instance Metadata Service only supports instances created with Azure Resource Manager. In the future, support for  Cloud Service VMs might be added.
3. I created my Virtual Machine through Azure Resource Manager a while back. Why am I not see compute metadata information?
   * For any VMs created after Sep 2016, add a [Tag](../../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md) to start seeing compute metadata. For older VMs (created before Sep 2016), add/remove extensions or data disks to the VM to refresh metadata.
4. I am not seeing all data populated for new version
   * For any VMs created after Sep 2016, add a [Tag](../../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md) to start seeing compute metadata. For older VMs (created before Sep 2016), add/remove extensions or data disks to the VM to refresh metadata.
5. Why am I getting the error `500 Internal Server Error`?
   * Retry your request based on exponential back off system. If the issue persists contact  Azure support.
6. Where do I share additional questions/comments?
   * Send your comments on https://feedback.azure.com.
7. Would this work for Virtual Machine Scale Set Instance?
   * Yes Metadata service is available for Scale Set Instances.
8. How do I get support for the service?
   * To get support for the service, create a support issue in Azure portal for the VM where you are not able to get metadata response after long retries.
9. I get request timed out for my call to the service?
   * Metadata calls must be made from the primary IP address assigned to the primary network card of the VM, in addition in case you have changed your routes there must be a route for 169.254.0.0/16 address out of your network card.
10. I updated my tags in virtual machine scale set but they don't appear in the instances unlike VMs?
    * Currently for ScaleSets tags only show to the VM on a reboot/reimage/or a disk change to the instance.
