# Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in Azure with PowerShell

The Azure PowerShell module is used to create and manage Azure resources from the PowerShell command line or in scripts. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure PowerShell module to deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) in Azure. This quickstart uses the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS marketplace image from Canonical. To see your VM in action, you'll also SSH to the VM and install the NGINX web server.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. 

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press enter to run it.

## Create SSH key pair

You need an SSH key pair to complete this quickstart. If you already have an SSH key pair, you can skip this step.

Open a bash shell and use [ssh-keygen](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/) to create an SSH key pair. If you don't have a bash shell on your local computer, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash).  

```azurepowershell-interactive
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

For more detailed information on how to create SSH key pairs, including the use of PuTTy, see [How to use SSH keys with Windows](ssh-from-windows.md).

If you create your SSH key pair using the Cloud Shell, it will be stored in a container image in a [storage account that is automatically created by Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/persisting-shell-storage.md). Don't delete the storage account, or the files share within it, until after you have retrieved your keys or you will lose access to the VM. 

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
```

## Create virtual network resources

Create a virtual network, subnet, and a public IP address. These resources are used to provide network connectivity to the VM and connect it to the internet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a subnet configuration
$subnetConfig = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
  -Name "mySubnet" `
  -AddressPrefix 192.168.1.0/24

# Create a virtual network
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "EastUS" `
  -Name "myVNET" `
  -AddressPrefix 192.168.0.0/16 `
  -Subnet $subnetConfig

# Create a public IP address and specify a DNS name
$pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "EastUS" `
  -AllocationMethod Static `
  -IdleTimeoutInMinutes 4 `
  -Name "mypublicdns$(Get-Random)"
```

Create an Azure Network Security Group and traffic rule. The Network Security Group secures the VM with inbound and outbound rules. In the following example, an inbound rule is created for TCP port 22 that allows SSH connections. To allow incoming web traffic, an inbound rule for TCP port 80 is also created.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create an inbound network security group rule for port 22
$nsgRuleSSH = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "myNetworkSecurityGroupRuleSSH"  `
  -Protocol "Tcp" `
  -Direction "Inbound" `
  -Priority 1000 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix * `
  -SourcePortRange * `
  -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 22 `
  -Access "Allow"

# Create an inbound network security group rule for port 80
$nsgRuleWeb = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "myNetworkSecurityGroupRuleWWW"  `
  -Protocol "Tcp" `
  -Direction "Inbound" `
  -Priority 1001 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix * `
  -SourcePortRange * `
  -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 80 `
  -Access "Allow"

# Create a network security group
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "EastUS" `
  -Name "myNetworkSecurityGroup" `
  -SecurityRules $nsgRuleSSH,$nsgRuleWeb
```

Create a virtual network interface card (NIC) with [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface). The virtual NIC connects the VM to a subnet, Network Security Group, and public IP address.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a virtual network card and associate with public IP address and NSG
$nic = New-AzNetworkInterface `
  -Name "myNic" `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "EastUS" `
  -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id `
  -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id `
  -NetworkSecurityGroupId $nsg.Id
```

## Create a virtual machine

To create a VM in PowerShell, you create a configuration that has settings like the image to use, size, and authentication options. Then the configuration is used to build the VM.

Define the SSH credentials, OS information, and VM size. In this example, the SSH key is stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Define a credential object
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString ' ' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("azureuser", $securePassword)

# Create a virtual machine configuration
$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig `
  -VMName "myVM" `
  -VMSize "Standard_D1" | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem `
  -Linux `
  -ComputerName "myVM" `
  -Credential $cred `
  -DisablePasswordAuthentication | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage `
  -PublisherName "Canonical" `
  -Offer "UbuntuServer" `
  -Skus "16.04-LTS" `
  -Version "latest" | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface `
  -Id $nic.Id

# Configure the SSH key
$sshPublicKey = cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Add-AzVMSshPublicKey `
  -VM $vmconfig `
  -KeyData $sshPublicKey `
  -Path "/home/azureuser/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Now, combine the previous configuration definitions to create with [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm):

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location eastus -VM $vmConfig
```

It will take a few minutes for your VM to be deployed. When the deployment is finished, move on to the next section.

## Connect to the VM

Create an SSH connection with the VM using the public IP address. To see the public IP address of the VM, use the [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" | Select "IpAddress"
```

Using the same bash shell you used to create your SSH key pair (like the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) or your local bash shell) paste the SSH connection command into the shell to create an SSH session.

```bash
ssh azureuser@10.111.12.123
```

When prompted, the login user name is *azureuser*. If a passphrase is used with your SSH keys, you need to enter that when prompted.


## Install NGINX

To see your VM in action, install the NGINX web server. From your SSH session, update your package sources and then install the latest NGINX package.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

When done, type `exit` to leave the SSH session.


## View the web server in action

Use a web browser of your choice to view the default NGINX welcome page. Enter the public IP address of the VM as the web address. The public IP address can be found on the VM overview page or as part of the SSH connection string you used earlier.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) cmdlet to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple virtual machine, created a Network Security Group and rule, and installed a basic web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Linux VMs.
