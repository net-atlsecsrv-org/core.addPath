# Benchmark your application on Azure Disk Storage

Benchmarking is the process of simulating different workloads on your application and measuring the application performance for each workload. Using the steps described in the [designing for high performance article](../premium-storage-performance.md). By running benchmarking tools on the VMs hosting the application, you can determine the performance levels that your application can achieve with Premium Storage. In this article, we provide you examples of benchmarking a Standard DS14 VM provisioned with Azure Premium Storage disks.

We have used common benchmarking tools Iometer and FIO, for Windows and Linux respectively. These tools spawn multiple threads simulating a production like workload, and measure the system performance. Using the tools you can also configure parameters like block size and queue depth, which you normally cannot change for an application. This gives you more flexibility to drive the maximum performance on a high scale VM provisioned with premium disks for different types of application workloads. To learn more about each benchmarking tool visit [Iometer](http://www.iometer.org/) and [FIO](http://freecode.com/projects/fio).

To follow the examples below, create a Standard DS14 VM and attach 11 Premium Storage disks to the VM. Of the 11 disks, configure 10 disks with host caching as "None" and stripe them into a volume called NoCacheWrites. Configure host caching as "ReadOnly" on the remaining disk and create a volume called CacheReads with this disk. Using this setup, you are able to see the maximum Read and Write performance from a Standard DS14 VM. For detailed steps about creating a DS14 VM with premium disks, go to [Designing for high performance](../premium-storage-performance.md).

## Next steps

Proceed to our article on [designing for high performance](../premium-storage-performance.md).

In that article, you create a checklist similar to your existing application for the prototype. Using Benchmarking tools you can simulate the workloads and measure performance on the prototype application. By doing so, you can determine which disk offering can match or surpass your application performance requirements. Then you can implement the same guidelines for your production application.
