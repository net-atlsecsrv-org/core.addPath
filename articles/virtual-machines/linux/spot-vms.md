# Use Spot VMs in Azure


[!INCLUDE [common-spot-vms](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-spot-vms.md)]  



## Next steps
Use the [CLI](spot-cli.md), [portal](../windows/spot-portal.md) or [PowerShell](../windows/spot-powershell.md) to deploy Spot VMs.

You can also deploy a [scale set with Spot VM instances](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot.md).
