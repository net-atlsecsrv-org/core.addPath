# Technical deep dive on platform-supported migration from classic to Azure Resource Manager

Let's take a deep-dive on migrating from the Azure classic deployment model to the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. We look at resources at a resource and feature level to help you understand how the Azure platform migrates resources between the two deployment models. For more information, please read the service announcement article: [Platform-supported migration of IaaS resources from classic to Azure Resource Manager](migration-classic-resource-manager-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
