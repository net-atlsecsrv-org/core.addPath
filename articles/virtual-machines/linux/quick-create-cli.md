# Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine with the Azure CLI

This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure command-line interface (CLI) to deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) in Azure. The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts.

In this tutorial, we will be installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. To show the VM in action, you'll connect to it using SSH and install the NGINX web server.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. 

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also open Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com/bash](https://shell.azure.com/bash). Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and select **Enter** to run it.

If you prefer to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires Azure CLI version 2.0.30 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create virtual machine

Create a VM with the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) command.

The following example creates a VM named *myVM* and adds a user account named *azureuser*. The `--generate-ssh-keys` parameter is used to automatically generate an SSH key, and put it in the default key location (*~/.ssh*). To use a specific set of keys instead, use the `--ssh-key-value` option.

```azurecli-interactive
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```

It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources. The following example output shows the VM create operation was successful.

```output
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.68.254.142",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}
```

Note your own `publicIpAddress` in the output from your VM. This address is used to access the VM in the next steps.

## Open port 80 for web traffic

By default, only SSH connections are opened when you create a Linux VM in Azure. Use [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm) to open TCP port 80 for use with the NGINX web server:

```azurecli-interactive
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

## Connect to virtual machine

SSH to your VM as normal. Replace **publicIpAddress** with the public IP address of your VM as noted in the previous output from your VM:

```bash
ssh azureuser@publicIpAddress
```

## Install web server

To see your VM in action, install the NGINX web server. Update your package sources and then install the latest NGINX package.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

When done, type `exit` to leave the SSH session.

## View the web server in action

Use a web browser of your choice to view the default NGINX welcome page. Use the public IP address of your VM as the web address. The following example shows the default NGINX web site:

![View the NGINX welcome page](./media/quick-create-cli/view-the-nginx-welcome-page.png)

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources. 

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple virtual machine, open a network port for web traffic, and installed a basic web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Linux VMs.
