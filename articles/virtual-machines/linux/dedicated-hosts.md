# Preview: Azure Dedicated Hosts

Azure Dedicated Host is a service that provides physical servers - able to host one or more virtual machines - dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our data centers, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. Then, you can place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration best meets your needs.

## Next steps

- You can deploy a dedicated host using the [Azure CLI](dedicated-hosts-cli.md), [portal](dedicated-hosts-portal.md), and [PowerShell](../windows/dedicated-hosts-powershell.md).

- For more information, see the [Dedicated hosts](dedicated-hosts.md) overview.

- There is sample template, found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/201-vm-dedicated-hosts/README.md), that uses both zones and fault domains for maximum resiliency in a region.
