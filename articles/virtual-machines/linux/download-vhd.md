# Download a Linux VHD from Azure

In this article, you learn how to download a Linux virtual hard disk (VHD) file from Azure using the Azure portal. 

## Stop the VM

A VHD canâ€™t be downloaded from Azure if it's attached to a running VM. If you want to keep the VM running, you can [create a snapshot and then download the snapshot](#alternative-snapshot-the-vm-disk).

To stop the VM:

1.	Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.	On the left menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
3.	Select the VM from the list.
4.	On the page for the VM, select **Stop**.

### Alternative: Snapshot the VM disk

Take a snapshot of the disk to download.

1. Select the VM in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Disks** in the left menu and then select the disk you want to snapshot. The details of the disk will be displayed.  
3. Select **Create Snapshot** from the menu at the top of the page. The **Create snapshot** page will open.
4. In **Name**, type a name for the snapshot. 
5. For **Snapshot type**, select **Full** or **Incremental**.
6. When you are done, select **Review + create**.

Your snapshot will be created shortly, and may then be used to download or create another VM from.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't stop the VM first, the snapshot will not be clean. The snapshot will be in the same state as if the VM had been power cycled or crashed at the point in time when the snapshot was made.  While usually safe, it could cause problems if the running applications running a the time were not crash resistant.
>  
> This method is only recommended for VMs with a single OS disk. VMs with one or more data disks should be stopped before download or before creating a snapshot for the OS disk and each data disk.

## Generate SAS URL

To download the VHD file, you need to generate a [shared access signature (SAS)](../../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/toc.json) URL. When the URL is generated, an expiration time is assigned to the URL.

1. On the menu of the page for the VM, select **Disks**.
2. Select the operating system disk for the VM, and then select **Disk Export**.
1. If the needed, update the value of **URL expires in (seconds)** to give you enough time to complete the download. The default is 3600 seconds (one hour).
3. Select **Generate URL**.
 
      
## Download VHD

1.	Under the URL that was generated, select **Download the VHD file**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/download-vhd/export-download.PNG" alt-text="Shows the button to download the VHD.":::

2.	You may need to select **Save** in the browser to start the download. The default name for the VHD file is *abcd*.
