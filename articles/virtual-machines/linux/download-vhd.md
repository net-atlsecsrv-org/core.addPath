# Download a Linux VHD from Azure

In this article, you learn how to download a Linux virtual hard disk (VHD) file from Azure using the Azure portal. 

## Stop the VM

A VHD canâ€™t be downloaded from Azure if it's attached to a running VM. You need to stop the VM to download the VHD. 

1.	Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.	On the left menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
3.	Select the VM from the list.
4.	On the page for the VM, select **Stop**.

## Generate SAS URL

To download the VHD file, you need to generate a [shared access signature (SAS)](../../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/toc.json) URL. When the URL is generated, an expiration time is assigned to the URL.

1. On the menu of the page for the VM, select **Disks**.
2. Select the operating system disk for the VM, and then select **Disk Export**.
1. If the needed, update the value of **URL expires in (seconds)** to give you enough time to complete the download. The default is 3600 seconds (one hour).
3. Select **Generate URL**.
 
      
## Download VHD
