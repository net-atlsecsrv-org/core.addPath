# Create a shared image gallery with the Azure CLI

A [Shared Image Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md) simplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. 

The Shared Image Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others in your organization, within or across regions, within an AAD tenant. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group shared images. 

The gallery is a top-level resource that provides full role-based access control (RBAC). Images can be versioned, and you can choose to replicate each image version to a different set of Azure regions. The gallery only works with Managed Images.

The Shared Image Gallery feature has multiple resource types. We will be using or building these in this article:

| Resource | Description|
|----------|------------|
| **Managed image** | This is a basic image that can be used alone or used to create an **image version** in an image gallery. Managed images are created from generalized VMs. A managed image is a special type of VHD that can be used to make multiple VMs and can now be used to create shared image versions. |
| **Image gallery** | Like the Azure Marketplace, an **image gallery** is a repository for managing and sharing images, but you control who has access. |
| **Image definition** | Images are defined within a gallery and carry information about the image and requirements for using it internally. This includes whether the image is Windows or Linux, release notes, and minimum and maximum memory requirements. It is a definition of a type of image. |
| **Image version** | An **image version** is what you use to create a VM when using a gallery. You can have multiple versions of an image as needed for your environment. Like a managed image, when you use an **image version** to create a VM, the image version is used to create new disks for the VM. Image versions can be used multiple times. |



[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-shared-images-cli](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-shared-images-cli.md)]

## Create a VM

Create a VM from the latest image version using [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create).

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create\
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --name myVM \
   --image "/subscriptions/subscription ID where the gallery is located>/resourceGroups/myGalleryRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/images/myImageDefinition" \
   --generate-ssh-keys
```

You can also use a specific version by using the image version ID for the `--image` parameter. For example, to use image version *1.0.0* type: `--image "/subscriptions/<subscription ID where the gallery is located>/resourceGroups/myGalleryRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/images/myImageDefinition/versions/1.0.0"`.

## Next steps
[Azure Image Builder (preview)](image-builder-overview.md) can help automate image version creation, you can even use it to update and [create a new image version from an existing image version](image-builder-gallery-update-image-version.md). 

You can also create Shared Image Gallery resources using templates. There are several Azure Quickstart Templates available: 

- [Create a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-create/)
- [Create an Image Definition in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-definition-create/)
- [Create an Image Version in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-version-create/)
- [Create a VM from Image Version](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-vm-from-sig/)

For more information about Shared Image Galleries, see the [Overview](shared-image-galleries.md). If you run into issues, see [Troubleshooting shared image galleries](troubleshooting-shared-images.md).
