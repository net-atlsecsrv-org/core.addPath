# Find and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks
When you delete a virtual machine (VM) in Azure, by default, any disks that are attached to the VM aren't deleted. This feature helps to prevent data loss due to the unintentional deletion of VMs. After a VM is deleted, you will continue to pay for unattached disks. This article shows you how to find and delete any unattached disks and reduce unnecessary costs. 


## Managed disks: Find and delete unattached disks 

The following script looks for unattached [managed disks](managed-disks-overview.md) by examining the value of the **ManagedBy** property. When a managed disk is attached to a VM, the **ManagedBy** property contains the resource ID of the VM. When a managed disk is unattached, the **ManagedBy** property is null. The script examines all the managed disks in an Azure subscription. When the script locates a managed disk with the **ManagedBy** property set to null, the script determines that the disk is unattached.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>First, run the script by setting the **deleteUnattachedDisks** variable to 0. This action lets you find and view all the unattached managed disks.
>
>After you review all the unattached disks, run the script again and set the **deleteUnattachedDisks** variable to 1. This action lets you delete all the unattached managed disks.
>

```azurecli

# Set deleteUnattachedDisks=1 if you want to delete unattached Managed Disks
# Set deleteUnattachedDisks=0 if you want to see the Id of the unattached Managed Disks
deleteUnattachedDisks=0

unattachedDiskIds=$(az disk list --query '[?managedBy==`null`].[id]' -o tsv)
for id in ${unattachedDiskIds[@]}
do
    if (( $deleteUnattachedDisks == 1 ))
    then

        echo "Deleting unattached Managed Disk with Id: "$id
        az disk delete --ids $id --yes
        echo "Deleted unattached Managed Disk with Id: "$id

    else
        echo $id
    fi
done
```

## Unmanaged disks: Find and delete unattached disks 

Unmanaged disks are VHD files that are stored as [page blobs](/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#about-page-blobs) in [Azure storage accounts](../../storage/common/storage-create-storage-account.md). The following script looks for unattached unmanaged disks (page blobs) by examining the value of the **LeaseStatus** property. When an unmanaged disk is attached to a VM, the **LeaseStatus** property is set to **Locked**. When an unmanaged disk is unattached, the **LeaseStatus** property is set to **Unlocked**. The script examines all the unmanaged disks in all the Azure storage accounts in an Azure subscription. When the script locates an unmanaged disk with a **LeaseStatus** property set to **Unlocked**, the script determines that the disk is unattached.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>First, run the script by setting the **deleteUnattachedVHDs** variable to 0. This action lets you find and view all the unattached unmanaged VHDs.
>
>After you review all the unattached disks, run the script again and set the **deleteUnattachedVHDs** variable to 1. This action lets you delete all the unattached unmanaged VHDs.

```azurecli
   
# Set deleteUnattachedVHDs=1 if you want to delete unattached VHDs
# Set deleteUnattachedVHDs=0 if you want to see the details of the unattached VHDs
deleteUnattachedVHDs=0

storageAccountIds=$(az storage account list --query [].[id] -o tsv)

for id in ${storageAccountIds[@]}
do
    connectionString=$(az storage account show-connection-string --ids $id --query connectionString -o tsv)
    containers=$(az storage container list --connection-string $connectionString --query [].[name] -o tsv)

    for container in ${containers[@]}
    do 
        
        blobs=$(az storage blob list -c $container --connection-string $connectionString --query "[?properties.blobType=='PageBlob' && ends_with(name,'.vhd')].[name]" -o tsv)
        
        for blob in ${blobs[@]}
        do
            leaseStatus=$(az storage blob show -n $blob -c $container --connection-string $connectionString --query "properties.lease.status" -o tsv)
            
            if [ "$leaseStatus" == "unlocked" ]
            then 

                if (( $deleteUnattachedVHDs == 1 ))
                then 

                    echo "Deleting VHD: "$blob" in container: "$container" in storage account: "$id

                    az storage blob delete --delete-snapshots include  -n $blob -c $container --connection-string $connectionString

                    echo "Deleted VHD: "$blob" in container: "$container" in storage account: "$id
                else
                    echo "StorageAccountId: "$id" container: "$container" VHD: "$blob
                fi

            fi
        done
    done
done 
```
