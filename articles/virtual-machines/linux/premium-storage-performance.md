# Azure premium storage: design for high performance
[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-premium-storage-introduction](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-premium-storage-introduction.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes, what appears to be a disk performance issue is actually a network bottleneck. In these situations, you should optimize your [network performance](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth.md).
>
> If you are looking to benchmark your disk, see our article on [Benchmarking a disk](disks-benchmarks.md).
>
> If your VM supports accelerated networking, you should make sure it is enabled. If it is not enabled, you can enable it on already deployed VMs on both [Windows](../../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell.md#enable-accelerated-networking-on-existing-vms) and [Linux](../../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli.md#enable-accelerated-networking-on-existing-vms).

Before you begin, if you are new to Premium Storage, first read the [Select an Azure disk type for IaaS VMs](disks-types.md) and [Azure Storage scalability and performance targets for storage accounts](../../storage/common/storage-scalability-targets.md).
