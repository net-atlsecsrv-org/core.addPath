# Scalability and performance targets for VM disks on Linux

[!INCLUDE [azure-storage-limits-vm-disks](../../../includes/azure-storage-limits-vm-disks.md)]

See [Linux VM sizes](../sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) for additional details.

## Managed virtual machine disks

Sizes denoted with an asterisk are currently in preview. See our [FAQ](../faq-for-disks.md#new-disk-sizes-managed-and-unmanaged) to learn what regions they are available in.

[!INCLUDE [azure-storage-limits-vm-disks-managed](../../../includes/azure-storage-limits-vm-disks-managed.md)]
