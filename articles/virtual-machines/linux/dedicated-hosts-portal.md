# Preview: Deploy VMs to dedicated hosts using the portal

This article guides you through how to create an Azure [dedicated host](dedicated-hosts.md) to host your virtual machines (VMs). 

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-dedicated-hosts-portal](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-dedicated-hosts-portal.md)]

## Create a VM

1. Choose **Create a resource** in the upper left corner of the Azure portal.
1. In the search box above the list of Azure Marketplace resources, search for and select **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS** by Canonical, then choose **Create**.
1. In the **Basics** tab, under **Project details**, make sure the correct subscription is selected and then select *myDedicatedHostsRG* as the **Resource group**. 
1. Under **Instance details**, type *myVM* for the **Virtual machine name** and choose *East US* for your **Location**.
1. In **Availability options** select **Availability zone**, select *1* from the drop-down.
1. For the size, select **Change size**. In the list of available sizes, choose one from the Esv3 series, like **Standard E2s v3**. You may need to clear the filter in order to see all of the available sizes.
1. Under **Administrator account**, select **SSH public key**, type your user name, then paste your public key into the text box. Remove any leading or trailing white space in your public key.

1. Under **Inbound port rules** > **Public inbound ports**, choose **Allow selected ports** and then select **SSH (22)** from the drop-down. 
1. At the top of the page, select the **Advanced** tab and in the **Host** section, select *myHostGroup* for **Host group** and *myHost* for the **Host**.

1. Leave the remaining defaults and then select the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.
1. When you see the message that validation has passed, select **Create**.

It will take a few minutes for your VM to be deployed.

## Next steps

- For more information, see the [Dedicated hosts](dedicated-hosts.md) overview.

- There is sample template, found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/201-vm-dedicated-hosts/README.md), that uses both zones and fault domains for maximum resiliency in a region.

- You can also deploy a dedicated host using the [Azure CLI](dedicated-hosts-cli.md).
