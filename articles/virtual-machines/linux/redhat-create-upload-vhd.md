# Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure

In this article, you will learn how to prepare a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machine for use in Azure. The versions of RHEL that are covered in this article are 6.7+ and 7.1+. The hypervisors for preparation that are covered in this article are Hyper-V, kernel-based virtual machine (KVM), and VMware. For more information about eligibility requirements for participating in Red Hat's Cloud Access program, see [Red Hat's Cloud Access website](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access) and [Running RHEL on Azure](https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/ccsp/microsoft-azure). For ways to automate building RHEL images, see [Azure Image Builder](../image-builder-overview.md).

## Hyper-V Manager

This section shows you how to prepare a [RHEL 6](#rhel-6-using-hyper-v-manager), [RHEL 7](#rhel-7-using-hyper-v-manager), or [RHEL 8](#rhel-8-using-hyper-v-manager) virtual machine using Hyper-V Manager.

### Prerequisites
This section assumes that you have already obtained an ISO file from the Red Hat website and installed the RHEL image to a virtual hard disk (VHD). For more details about how to use Hyper-V Manager to install an operating system image, see [Install the Hyper-V Role and Configure a Virtual Machine](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh846766(v=ws.11)).

**RHEL installation notes**

* Azure does not support the VHDX format. Azure supports only fixed VHD. You can use Hyper-V Manager to convert the disk to VHD format, or you can use the convert-vhd cmdlet. If you use VirtualBox, select **Fixed size** as opposed to the default dynamically allocated option when you create the disk.
* Azure supports Gen1 (BIOS boot) & Gen2 (UEFI boot) Virtual machines.
* The maximum size that's allowed for the VHD is 1,023 GB.
* Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is supported and may be used on the OS disk or data disks in Azure virtual machines. However, in general it is recommended to use standard partitions on the OS disk rather than LVM. This practice will avoid LVM name conflicts with cloned virtual machines, particularly if you ever need to attach an operating system disk to another identical virtual machine for troubleshooting. See also  [LVM](/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/linux/configure-lvm) and [RAID](/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/linux/configure-raid) documentation.
* **Kernel support for mounting Universal Disk Format (UDF) file systems is required**. At first boot on Azure, the UDF-formatted media that is attached to the guest passes the provisioning configuration to the Linux virtual machine. The Azure Linux Agent must be able to mount the UDF file system to read its configuration and provision the virtual machine, without this, provisioning will fail!
* Do not configure a swap partition on the operating system disk. More information about this can be found in the following steps.

* All VHDs on Azure must have a virtual size aligned to 1MB. When converting from a raw disk to VHD you must ensure that the raw disk size is a multiple of 1MB before conversion. More details can be found in the steps below. See also [Linux Installation Notes](create-upload-generic.md#general-linux-installation-notes) for more information.

### RHEL 6 using Hyper-V Manager

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the virtual machine.

1. Click **Connect** to open a console window for the virtual machine.

1. In RHEL 6, NetworkManager can interfere with the Azure Linux agent. Uninstall this package by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo rpm -e --nodeps NetworkManager
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    ```

1. Move (or remove) the udev rules to avoid generating static rules for the Ethernet interface. These rules cause problems when you clone a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure or Hyper-V:

    ```console
    # sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules

    # sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo chkconfig network on
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-6-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this modification, open `/boot/grub/menu.lst` in a text editor, and ensure that the default kernel includes the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 rootdelay=300
    ```

    This will also ensure that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues.
    
    In addition, we recommended that you remove the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```
    
    Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port.  You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more. This configuration might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.


1. Ensure that the secure shell (SSH) server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo yum install WALinuxAgent

    # sudo chkconfig waagent on
    ```

    Installing the WALinuxAgent package removes the NetworkManager and NetworkManager-gnome packages if they were not already removed in step 3.

1. Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    The Azure Linux Agent can automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. Note that the local resource disk is a temporary disk and that it might be emptied if the virtual machine is deprovisioned. After you install the Azure Linux Agent in the previous step, modify the following parameters in /etc/waagent.conf appropriately:

    ```config-cong
    ResourceDisk.Format=y
    ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
    ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=2048    ## NOTE: set this to whatever you need it to be.
    ```

1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary) by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```console
    # Note: if you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image,
    # skip the deprovision step
    # sudo waagent -force -deprovision

    # export HISTSIZE=0

    # logout
    ```

1. Click **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.


### RHEL 7 using Hyper-V Manager

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the virtual machine.

1. Click **Connect** to open a console window for the virtual machine.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes
    NM_CONTROLLED=yes
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo systemctl enable network
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this modification, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    
    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="serial console"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1
    ```
   
    This will also ensure that all console messages are sent to the first serial port and enable interaction with the serial console, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new RHEL 7 naming conventions for NICs.

    ```config
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```
   
    Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.

1. After you are done editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```console
    # sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > If uploading an UEFI enabled VM, the command to update grub is `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg`.

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent, cloud-init and other necesary utilities by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo yum install -y WALinuxAgent cloud-init cloud-utils-growpart gdisk hyperv-daemons

    # sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    # sudo systemctl enable cloud-init.service
    ```

1. Configure cloud-init to handle the provisioning:

    1. Configure waagent for cloud-init:

    ```console
    sed -i 's/Provisioning.Agent=auto/Provisioning.Agent=cloud-init/g' /etc/waagent.conf
    sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.Format=y/ResourceDisk.Format=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
    sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image, set `Provisioning.Agent=disabled` on the `/etc/waagent.conf` config.
    
    1. Configure mounts:

    ```console
    echo "Adding mounts and disk_setup to init stage"
    sed -i '/ - mounts/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    sed -i '/ - disk_setup/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - mounts' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - disk_setup' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    ```
    
    1. Configure Azure datasource:

    ```console
    echo "Allow only Azure datasource, disable fetching network setting via IMDS"
    cat > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91-azure_datasource.cfg <<EOF
    datasource_list: [ Azure ]
    datasource:
        Azure:
            apply_network_config: False
    EOF
    ```

    1. If configured, remove existing swapfile:

    ```console
    if [[ -f /mnt/resource/swapfile ]]; then
    echo "Removing swapfile" #RHEL uses a swapfile by defaul
    swapoff /mnt/resource/swapfile
    rm /mnt/resource/swapfile -f
    fi
    ```
    1. Configure cloud-init logging:
    ```console
    echo "Add console log file"
    cat >> /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg <<EOF

    # This tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
    # 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
    # there without needing to look on the console.
    output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}
    EOF

    ```

1. Swap configuration 
    Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    Previously, the Azure Linux Agent was used automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. However this is now handled by cloud-init, you **must not** use the Linux Agent to format the resource disk create the swap file, modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

    ```console
    ResourceDisk.Format=n
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
    ```

    If you want mount, format and create swap you can either:
    * Pass this in as a cloud-init config every time you create a VM
    * Use a cloud-init directive baked into the image that will do this every time the VM is created:

        ```console
        cat > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg << EOF
        #cloud-config
        # Generated by Azure cloud image build
        disk_setup:
          ephemeral0:
            table_type: mbr
            layout: [66, [33, 82]]
            overwrite: True
        fs_setup:
          - device: ephemeral0.1
            filesystem: ext4
          - device: ephemeral0.2
            filesystem: swap
        mounts:
          - ["ephemeral0.1", "/mnt"]
          - ["ephemeral0.2", "none", "swap", "sw", "0", "0"]
        EOF
        ```
1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Deprovision

	Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image, skip the deprovision step. Running the command `waagent -force -deprovision` will render the source machine unusable, this step is intended only to create a generalized image.
	```console
	# sudo waagent -force -deprovision

	# export HISTSIZE=0

	# logout
	```
    

1. Click **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.

### RHEL 8 using Hyper-V Manager

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the virtual machine.

1. Click **Connect** to open a console window for the virtual machine.

1. Ensure that the Network Manager service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
    ```

1. Configure the network interface to automatically start at boot and use DHCP:

    ```console
    # nmcli con mod eth0 connection.autoconnect yes ipv4.method auto
    ```


1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure and enable the serial console. 

    1. Remove current GRUB parameters:
    ```console
    # grub2-editenv - unset kernelopts
    ```

    1. Edit `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and add the following paramters:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="serial console"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
    ```
   
   This will also ensure that all console messages are sent to the first serial port and enable interaction with the serial console, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new naming conventions for NICs.
   
   1. Additionally, we recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```config
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```
   
    Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.

1. After you are done editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```console
    # sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```
    And for an UEFI enabled VM, run the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent, cloud-init and other necesary utilities by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo yum install -y WALinuxAgent cloud-init cloud-utils-growpart gdisk hyperv-daemons

    # sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    # sudo systemctl enable cloud-init.service
    ```

1. Configure cloud-init to handle the provisioning:

    1. Configure waagent for cloud-init:

    ```console
    sed -i 's/Provisioning.Agent=auto/Provisioning.Agent=cloud-init/g' /etc/waagent.conf
    sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.Format=y/ResourceDisk.Format=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
    sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image, set `Provisioning.Agent=disabled` on the `/etc/waagent.conf` config.
    
    1. Configure mounts:

    ```console
    echo "Adding mounts and disk_setup to init stage"
    sed -i '/ - mounts/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    sed -i '/ - disk_setup/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - mounts' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - disk_setup' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
    ```
    
    1. Configure Azure datasource:

    ```console
    echo "Allow only Azure datasource, disable fetching network setting via IMDS"
    cat > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91-azure_datasource.cfg <<EOF
    datasource_list: [ Azure ]
    datasource:
        Azure:
            apply_network_config: False
    EOF
    ```

    1. If configured, remove existing swapfile:

    ```console
    if [[ -f /mnt/resource/swapfile ]]; then
    echo "Removing swapfile" #RHEL uses a swapfile by defaul
    swapoff /mnt/resource/swapfile
    rm /mnt/resource/swapfile -f
    fi
    ```
    1. Configure cloud-init logging:
    ```console
    echo "Add console log file"
    cat >> /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg <<EOF

    # This tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
    # 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
    # there without needing to look on the console.
    output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}
    EOF

    ```

1. Swap configuration 
    Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    Previously, the Azure Linux Agent was used automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. However this is now handled by cloud-init, you **must not** use the Linux Agent to format the resource disk create the swap file, modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

    ```console
    ResourceDisk.Format=n
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
    ```

    If you want mount, format and create swap you can either:
    * Pass this in as a cloud-init config every time you create a VM
    * Use a cloud-init directive baked into the image that will do this every time the VM is created:

        ```console
        cat > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg << EOF
        #cloud-config
        # Generated by Azure cloud image build
        disk_setup:
          ephemeral0:
            table_type: mbr
            layout: [66, [33, 82]]
            overwrite: True
        fs_setup:
          - device: ephemeral0.1
            filesystem: ext4
          - device: ephemeral0.2
            filesystem: swap
        mounts:
          - ["ephemeral0.1", "/mnt"]
          - ["ephemeral0.2", "none", "swap", "sw", "0", "0"]
        EOF
        ```
1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Deprovision

	Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

	```console
	# sudo waagent -force -deprovision

	# export HISTSIZE=0

	# logout
	```
    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image, skip the deprovision step. Running the command `waagent -force -deprovision` will render the source machine unusable, this step is intended only to create a generalized image.


1. Click **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.


## KVM

This section shows you how to use KVM to prepare a [RHEL 6](#rhel-6-using-kvm) or [RHEL 7](#rhel-7-using-kvm) distro to upload to Azure. 

### RHEL 6 using KVM

1. Download the KVM image of RHEL 6 from the Red Hat website.

1. Set a root password.

    Generate an encrypted password, and copy the output of the command:

    ```console
    # openssl passwd -1 changeme
    ```

    Set a root password with guestfish:

    ```console
    # guestfish --rw -a <image-name>
    > <fs> run
    > <fs> list-filesystems
    > <fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
    > <fs> vi /etc/shadow
    > <fs> exit
    ```

   Change the second field of the root user from "!!" to the encrypted password.

1. Create a virtual machine in KVM from the qcow2 image. Set the disk type to **qcow2**, and set the virtual network interface device model to **virtio**. Then, start the virtual machine, and sign in as root.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    ```

1. Move (or remove) the udev rules to avoid generating static rules for the Ethernet interface. These rules cause problems when you clone a virtual machine in Azure or Hyper-V:

    ```console
    # sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules

    # sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```console
    # chkconfig network on
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this configuration, open `/boot/grub/menu.lst` in a text editor, and ensure that the default kernel includes the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 rootdelay=300
    ```

    This will also ensure that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues.
    
    In addition, we recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

    Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.


1. Add Hyper-V modules to initramfs:  

    Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, and add the following content:

    ```config-conf
    add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```config-conf
    # dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Uninstall cloud-init:

    ```console
    # yum remove cloud-init
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time:

    ```console
    # chkconfig sshd on
    ```

    Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to include the following lines:

    ```config
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-6-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent by running the following command:

    ```console
    # yum install WALinuxAgent

    # chkconfig waagent on
    ```

1. The Azure Linux Agent can automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. Note that the local resource disk is a temporary disk, and it might be emptied if the virtual machine is deprovisioned. After you install the Azure Linux Agent in the previous step, modify the following parameters in **/etc/waagent.conf** appropriately:

    ```config-conf
    ResourceDisk.Format=y
    ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
    ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=2048    ## NOTE: set this to whatever you need it to be.
    ```

1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary) by running the following command:

    ```console-conf
    # subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```console
    # Note: if you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image,
    # skip the deprovision step
    # sudo rm -rf /var/lib/waagent/
    # sudo rm -f /var/log/waagent.log

    # waagent -force -deprovision+user
    # rm -f ~/.bash_history
    

    # export HISTSIZE=0

    # logout
    ```

1. Shut down the virtual machine in KVM.

1. Convert the qcow2 image to the VHD format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There is a known bug in qemu-img versions >=2.2.1 that results in an improperly formatted VHD. The issue has been fixed in QEMU 2.6. It is recommended to use either qemu-img 2.2.0 or lower, or update to 2.6 or higher. Reference: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1490611.
    >

    First convert the image to raw format:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw rhel-6.9.qcow2 rhel-6.9.raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```console
    # MB=$((1024*1024))
    # size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-6.9.raw" | \
      gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')

    # rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    # qemu-img resize rhel-6.9.raw $rounded_size
    ```

    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-sized VHD:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-6.9.raw rhel-6.9.vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **2.6+** include the `force_size` option:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-6.9.raw rhel-6.9.vhd
    ```

		
### RHEL 7 using KVM

1. Download the KVM image of RHEL 7 from the Red Hat website. This procedure uses RHEL 7 as the example.

1. Set a root password.

    Generate an encrypted password, and copy the output of the command:

    ```console
    # openssl passwd -1 changeme
    ```

    Set a root password with guestfish:

    ```console
    # guestfish --rw -a <image-name>
    > <fs> run
    > <fs> list-filesystems
    > <fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
    > <fs> vi /etc/shadow
    > <fs> exit
    ```

   Change the second field of root user from "!!" to the encrypted password.

1. Create a virtual machine in KVM from the qcow2 image. Set the disk type to **qcow2**, and set the virtual network interface device model to **virtio**. Then, start the virtual machine, and sign in as root.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes
    NM_CONTROLLED=yes
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo systemctl enable network
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this configuration, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    ```

   This command also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. The command also turns off the new RHEL 7 naming conventions for NICs. In addition, we recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

    Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.

1. After you are done editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```console
    # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Add Hyper-V modules into initramfs.

    Edit `/etc/dracut.conf` and add content:

    ```config-conf
    add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```config-conf
    # dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Uninstall cloud-init:

    ```console
    # yum remove cloud-init
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time:

    ```console
    # systemctl enable sshd
    ```

    Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to include the following lines:

    ```config
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```config
    # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent by running the following command:

    ```console
    # yum install WALinuxAgent
    ```

    Enable the waagent service:

    ```console
    # systemctl enable waagent.service
    ```

1. Install cloud-init
Follow the steps in 'Prepare a RHEL 7 virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager', step 12, 'Install cloud-init to handle the provisioning.'

1. Swap configuration 

    Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.
    Follow the steps in 'Prepare a RHEL 7 virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager', step 13, 'Swap configuration'


1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary) by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager unregister
    ```


1. Deprovision

    Follow the steps in 'Prepare a RHEL 7 virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager', step 15, 'Deprovision'

1. Shut down the virtual machine in KVM.

1. Convert the qcow2 image to the VHD format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There is a known bug in qemu-img versions >=2.2.1 that results in an improperly formatted VHD. The issue has been fixed in QEMU 2.6. It is recommended to use either qemu-img 2.2.0 or lower, or update to 2.6 or higher. Reference: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1490611.
    >

    First convert the image to raw format:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw rhel-7.4.qcow2 rhel-7.4.raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```console
    # MB=$((1024*1024))
    # size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-7.4.raw" | \
      gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')

    # rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    # qemu-img resize rhel-7.4.raw $rounded_size
    ```

    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-sized VHD:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **2.6+** include the `force_size` option:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

## VMware

This section shows you how to prepare a [RHEL 6](#rhel-6-using-vmware) or [RHEL 7](#rhel-6-using-vmware)  distro from VMware.

### Prerequisites
This section assumes that you have already installed a RHEL virtual machine in VMware. For details about how to install an operating system in VMware, see [VMware Guest Operating System Installation Guide](https://partnerweb.vmware.com/GOSIG/home.html).

* When you install the Linux operating system, we recommend that you use standard partitions rather than LVM, which is often the default for many installations. This will avoid LVM name conflicts with cloned virtual machine, particularly if an operating system disk ever needs to be attached to another virtual machine for troubleshooting. LVM or RAID can be used on data disks if preferred.
* Do not configure a swap partition on the operating system disk. You can configure the Linux agent to create a swap file on the temporary resource disk. You can find more information about this in the steps that follow.
* When you create the virtual hard disk, select **Store virtual disk as a single file**.

### RHEL 6 using VMware
1. In RHEL 6, NetworkManager can interfere with the Azure Linux agent. Uninstall this package by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo rpm -e --nodeps NetworkManager
    ```

1. Create a file named **network** in the /etc/sysconfig/ directory that contains the following text:

    ```console
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    ```

1. Move (or remove) the udev rules to avoid generating static rules for the Ethernet interface. These rules cause problems when you clone a virtual machine in Azure or Hyper-V:

    ```console
    # sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules

    # sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo chkconfig network on
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```console
    # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-6-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0"
    ```

   This will also ensure that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. In addition, we recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```
   
    Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.

1. Add Hyper-V modules to initramfs:

    Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, and add the following content:

    ```config-conf
    add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```config-cong
    # dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo yum install WALinuxAgent

    # sudo chkconfig waagent on
    ```

1. Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    The Azure Linux Agent can automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. Note that the local resource disk is a temporary disk, and it might be emptied if the virtual machine is deprovisioned. After you install the Azure Linux Agent in the previous step, modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

    ```config-conf
    ResourceDisk.Format=y
    ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
    ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=2048    ## NOTE: set this to whatever you need it to be.
    ```

1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary) by running the following command:

    ```console
    # sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```console
    # Note: if you are migrating a specific virtual machine and do not wish to create a generalized image,
    # skip the deprovision step
    # sudo rm -rf /var/lib/waagent/
    # sudo rm -f /var/log/waagent.log

    # waagent -force -deprovision+user
    # rm -f ~/.bash_history
    

    # export HISTSIZE=0

    # logout
    ```

1. Shut down the virtual machine, and convert the VMDK file to a .vhd file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There is a known bug in qemu-img versions >=2.2.1 that results in an improperly formatted VHD. The issue has been fixed in QEMU 2.6. It is recommended to use either qemu-img 2.2.0 or lower, or update to 2.6 or higher. Reference: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1490611.

    First convert the image to raw format:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw rhel-6.9.vmdk rhel-6.9.raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```console
    # MB=$((1024*1024))
    # size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-6.9.raw" | \
      gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')

    # rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    # qemu-img resize rhel-6.9.raw $rounded_size
    ```

    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-sized VHD:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-6.9.raw rhel-6.9.vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **2.6+** include the `force_size` option:

    ```console
    # qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-6.9.raw rhel-6.9.vhd
    ```

### RHEL 7 using VMware

1. Place the kickstart file where the installation system can access it.

1. In Hyper-V Manager, create a new virtual machine. On the **Connect Virtual Hard Disk** page, select **Attach a virtual hard disk later**, and complete the New Virtual Machine Wizard.

1. Open the virtual machine settings:

	a.  Attach a new virtual hard disk to the virtual machine. Make sure to select **VHD Format** and **Fixed Size**.

	b.  Attach the installation ISO to the DVD drive.

	c.  Set the BIOS to boot from CD.

1. Start the virtual machine. When the installation guide appears, press **Tab** to configure the boot options.

1. Enter `inst.ks=<the location of the kickstart file>` at the end of the boot options, and press **Enter**.

1. Wait for the installation to finish. When it's finished, the virtual machine will be shut down automatically. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.

## Known issues
### The Hyper-V driver could not be included in the initial RAM disk when using a non-Hyper-V hypervisor

In some cases, Linux installers might not include the drivers for Hyper-V in the initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs) unless Linux detects that it is running in a Hyper-V environment.

When you're using a different virtualization system (that is, VirtualBox, Xen, etc.) to prepare your Linux image, you might need to rebuild initrd to ensure that at least the hv_vmbus and hv_storvsc kernel modules are available on the initial RAM disk. This is a known issue at least on systems that are based on the upstream Red Hat distribution.

To resolve this issue, add Hyper-V modules to initramfs and rebuild it:

Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, and add the following content:

```config-conf
add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
```

Rebuild initramfs:

```console
# dracut -f -v
```

For more details, see the information about [rebuilding initramfs](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1958).

## Next steps
* You're now ready to use your Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual hard disk to create new virtual machines in Azure. If this is the first time that you're uploading the .vhd file to Azure, see [Create a Linux VM from a custom disk](upload-vhd.md#option-1-upload-a-vhd).
* For more details about the hypervisors that are certified to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see [the Red Hat website](https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors).
* To learn more about using production-ready RHEL BYOS images, go to the documentation page for [BYOS](../workloads/redhat/byos.md).
