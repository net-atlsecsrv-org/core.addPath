# Managed disk bursting
[!INCLUDE [managed-disks-bursting](../../../includes/managed-disks-bursting.md)]

## Virtual Machine level bursting
VM level bursting support is enabled in all regions in Public Cloud on these supported sizes: 
- [Lsv2-series](../lsv2-series.md)

Bursting is enabled by default for virtual machines that support it.

## Disk level bursting
Bursting is also available on our [premium SSDs](disks-types.md#premium-ssd) for disk sizes P20 and smaller in all regions in Azure Public, Government, and China Clouds. Disk bursting is enabled by default on all new and existing deployments of the disk sizes that support it.
