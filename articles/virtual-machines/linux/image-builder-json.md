# Preview: Create an Azure Image Builder template 

Azure Image Builder uses a .json file to pass information into the Image Builder service. In this article we will go over the sections of the json file, so you can build your own. To see examples of full .json files, see the [Azure Image Builder GitHub](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/tree/master/quickquickstarts).

This is the basic template format:

```json
 { 
    "type": "Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates", 
    "apiVersion": "2020-02-14", 
    "location": "<region>", 
    "tags": {
        "<name": "<value>",
        "<name>": "<value>"
     },
    "identity":{},			 
    "dependsOn": [], 
    "properties": { 
        "buildTimeoutInMinutes": <minutes>, 
        "vmProfile": 
            {
            "vmSize": "<vmSize>",
            "osDiskSizeGB": <sizeInGB>,
            "vnetConfig": {
                "subnetId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<vnetRgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/<subnetName>"
                }
            },
        "source": {}, 
        "customize": {}, 
        "distribute": {} 
      } 
 } 
```



## Type and API version

The `type` is the resource type, which must be `"Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates"`. The `apiVersion` will change over time as the API changes, but should be `"2020-02-14"` for preview.

```json
    "type": "Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates",
    "apiVersion": "2020-02-14",
```

## Location

The location is the region where the custom image will be created. For the Image Builder preview, the following regions are supported:

- East US
- East US 2
- West Central US
- West US
- West US 2
- North Europe
- West Europe


```json
    "location": "<region>",
```
## vmProfile
By default Image Builder will use a "Standard_D1_v2" build VM, you can override this, for example, if you want to customize an Image for a GPU VM, you need a GPU VM size. This is optional.

```json
 {
    "vmSize": "Standard_D1_v2"
 },
```

## osDiskSizeGB

By default, Image Builder will not change the size of the image, it will use the size from the source image. You can **only** increase the size of the OS Disk (Win and Linux), this is optional, and a value of 0 means leave the same size as the source image. You cannot reduce the OS Disk size to smaller than the size from the source image.

```json
 {
    "osDiskSizeGB": 100
 },
```

## vnetConfig
If you do not specify any VNET properties, then Image Builder will create its own VNET, Public IP, and NSG. The Public IP is used for the service to communicate with the build VM, however if you do not want a Public IP or want Image Builder to have access to your existing VNET resources, such as configuration servers (DSC, Chef, Puppet, Ansible), file shares etc., then you can specify a VNET. For more information, review the [networking documentation](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/master/aibNetworking.md#networking-with-azure-vm-image-builder), this is optional.

```json
    "vnetConfig": {
        "subnetId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<vnetRgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/<subnetName>"
        }
    }
```
## Tags

These are key/value pairs you can specify for the image that's generated.

## Depends on (optional)

This optional section can be used to ensure that dependencies are completed before proceeding. 

```json
    "dependsOn": [],
```

For more information, see [Define resource dependencies](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/define-resource-dependency.md#dependson).

## Identity

Required - For Image Builder to have permissions to read/write images, read in scripts from Azure Storage you must create an Azure User-Assigned Identity, that has permissions to the individual resources. For details on how Image Builder permissions work, and relevant steps, please review the [documentation](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/master/aibPermissions.md#azure-vm-image-builder-permissions-explained-and-requirements).


```json
    "identity": {
    "type": "UserAssigned",
          "userAssignedIdentities": {
            "<imgBuilderId>": {}
        }
        },
```


Image Builder support for a User-Assigned Identity:
* Supports a single identity only
* Does not support custom domain names

To learn more, see [What is managed identities for Azure resources?](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).
For more information on deploying this feature, see [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on an Azure VM using Azure CLI](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md#user-assigned-managed-identity).

## Properties: source

Image Builder currently only supports HyperV generation 1 images and VMs, the `source` section contains information about the source image that will be used by Image Builder.

The API requires a 'SourceType' that defines the source for the image build, currently there are three types:
- PlatformImage - indicated the source image is a Marketplace image.
- ManagedImage - use this when starting from a regular managed image.
- SharedImageVersion - this is used when you are using an image version in a Shared Image Gallery as the source.


> [!NOTE]
> When using existing Windows custom images, you can run the Sysprep command up to 8 times on a single Windows image, for more information, see the [sysprep](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--generalize--a-windows-installation#limits-on-how-many-times-you-can-run-sysprep) documentation.

### PlatformImage source 
Azure Image Builder supports Windows Server and client, and Linux  Azure Marketplace images, see [here](../windows/image-builder-overview.md#os-support) for the full list. 

```json
        "source": {
            "type": "PlatformImage",
                "publisher": "Canonical",
                "offer": "UbuntuServer",
                "sku": "18.04-LTS",
                "version": "latest"
        },
```


The properties here are the same that are used to create VM's, using AZ CLI, run the below to get the properties: 
 
```azurecli-interactive
az vm image list -l westus -f UbuntuServer -p Canonical --output table –-all 
```

You can use 'latest' in the version, the version is evaluated when the image build takes place, not when the template is submitted. If you use this functionality with the Shared Image Gallery destination, you can avoid resubmitting the template, and rerun the image build at intervals, so your images are recreated from the most recent images.

#### Support for Market Place Plan Information
You can also specify plan information, for example:
```json
    "source": {
        "type": "PlatformImage",
        "publisher": "RedHat",
        "offer": "rhel-byos",
        "sku": "rhel-lvm75",
        "version": "latest",
        "planInfo": {
            "planName": "rhel-lvm75",
            "planProduct": "rhel-byos",
            "planPublisher": "redhat"
       }
```
### ManagedImage source

Sets the source image as an existing managed image of a generalized VHD or VM.

> [!NOTE]
> The source managed image must be of a supported OS and the image must same region as your Azure Image Builder template. 

```json
        "source": { 
            "type": "ManagedImage", 
                "imageId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/{destinationResourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/<imageName>"
        }
```

The `imageId` should be the ResourceId of the managed image. Use `az image list` to list available images.


### SharedImageVersion source
Sets the source image an existing image version in a Shared Image Gallery.

> [!NOTE]
> The source managed image must be of a supported OS and the image must same region as your Azure Image Builder template, if not, please replicate the image version to the Image Builder Template region.


```json
        "source": { 
            "type": "SharedImageVersion", 
            "imageVersionID": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/p  roviders/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<sharedImageGalleryName>/images/<imageDefinitionName/versions/<imageVersion>" 
   } 
```

The `imageVersionId` should be the ResourceId of the image version. Use [az sig image-version list](/cli/azure/sig/image-version#az-sig-image-version-list) to list image versions.


## Properties: buildTimeoutInMinutes

By default, the Image Builder will run for 240 minutes. After that, it will timeout and stop, whether or not the image build is complete. If the timeout is hit, you will see an error similar to this:

```text
[ERROR] Failed while waiting for packerizer: Timeout waiting for microservice to
[ERROR] complete: 'context deadline exceeded'
```

If you do not specify a buildTimeoutInMinutes value, or set it to 0, this will use the default value. You can increase or decrease the value, up to the maximum of 960mins (16hrs). For Windows, we do not recommend setting this below 60 minutes. If you find you are hitting the timeout, review the [logs](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/master/troubleshootingaib.md#collecting-and-reviewing-aib-image-build-logs), to see if the customization step is waiting on something like user input. 

If you find you need more time for customizations to complete, set this to what you think you need, with a little overhead. But, do not set it too high because you might have to wait for it to timeout before seeing an error. 


## Properties: customize

Image Builder supports multiple ‘customizers’. Customizers are functions that are used to customize your image, such as running scripts, or rebooting servers. 

When using `customize`: 
- You can use multiple customizers, but they must have a unique `name`.
- Customizers execute in the order specified in the template.
- If one customizer fails, then the whole customization component will fail and report back an error.
- It is strongly advised you test the script thoroughly before using it in a template. Debugging the script on your own VM will be easier.
- Do not put sensitive data in the scripts. 
- The script locations need to be publicly accessible, unless you are using [MSI](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/tree/master/quickquickstarts/7_Creating_Custom_Image_using_MSI_to_Access_Storage).

```json
        "customize": [
            {
                "type": "Shell",
                "name": "<name>",
                "scriptUri": "<path to script>",
                "sha256Checksum": "<sha256 checksum>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Shell",
                "name": "<name>",
                "inline": [
                    "<command to run inline>",
                ]
            }

        ],
```		

 
The customize section is an array. Azure Image Builder will run through the customizers in sequential order. Any failure in any customizer will fail the build process. 

> [!NOTE]
> Inline commands can be viewed in the image template definition and by Microsoft Support when helping with a support case. If you have sensitive information, it should be moved into scripts in Azure Storage, where access requires authentication.
 
### Shell customizer

The shell customizer supports running shell scripts, these must be publicly accessible for the IB to access them.

```json
    "customize": [ 
        { 
            "type": "Shell", 
            "name": "<name>", 
            "scriptUri": "<link to script>",
            "sha256Checksum": "<sha256 checksum>"       
		}, 
    ], 
        "customize": [ 
        { 
            "type": "Shell", 
            "name": "<name>", 
            "inline": "<commands to run>"
		}, 
	], 
```

OS Support: Linux 
 
Customize properties:

- **type** – Shell 
- **name** - name for tracking the customization 
- **scriptUri** - URI to the location of the file 
- **inline** - array of shell commands, separated by commas.
- **sha256Checksum** - Value of sha256 checksum of the file, you generate this locally, and then Image Builder will checksum and validate.
    * To generate the sha256Checksum, using a terminal on Mac/Linux run: `sha256sum <fileName>`


For commands to run with super user privileges, they must be prefixed with `sudo`.

> [!NOTE]
> Inline commands are stored as part of the image template definition, you can see these when you dump out the image definition, and these are also visible to Microsoft Support in the event of a support case for troubleshooting purposes. If you have sensitive commands or values, it is strongly recommended these are moved into scripts, and use a user identity to authenticate to Azure Storage.

### Windows restart customizer 
The Restart customizer allows you to restart a Windows VM and wait for it come back online, this allows you to install software that requires a reboot.  

```json 
     "customize": [ 

            {
                "type": "WindowsRestart",
                "restartCommand": "shutdown /r /f /t 0", 
                "restartCheckCommand": "echo Azure-Image-Builder-Restarted-the-VM  > c:\\buildArtifacts\\azureImageBuilderRestart.txt",
                "restartTimeout": "5m"
            }
  
        ],
```

OS Support: Windows
 
Customize properties:
- **Type**: WindowsRestart
- **restartCommand** - Command to execute the restart (optional). The default is `'shutdown /r /f /t 0 /c \"packer restart\"'`.
- **restartCheckCommand** – Command to check if restart succeeded (optional). 
- **restartTimeout** - Restart timeout specified as a string of magnitude and unit. For example, `5m` (5 minutes) or `2h` (2 hours). The default is: '5m'

### Linux restart  
There is no Linux Restart customizer, however, if you are installing drivers, or components that require a restart, you can install them and invoke a restart using the Shell customizer, there is a 20min SSH timeout to the build VM.

### PowerShell customizer 
The shell customizer supports running PowerShell scripts and inline command, the scripts must be publicly accessible for the IB to access them.

```json 
     "customize": [
        { 
             "type": "PowerShell",
             "name":   "<name>",  
             "scriptUri": "<path to script>",
             "runElevated": "<true false>",
             "sha256Checksum": "<sha256 checksum>" 
        }, 	
        { 
             "type": "PowerShell", 
             "name": "<name>", 
             "inline": "<PowerShell syntax to run>", 
             "validExitCodes": "<exit code>",
             "runElevated": "<true or false>" 
         } 
 	], 
```

OS support: Windows and Linux

Customize properties:

- **type** – PowerShell.
- **scriptUri** - URI to the location of the PowerShell script file. 
- **inline** – Inline commands to be run, separated by commas.
- **validExitCodes** – Optional, valid codes that can be returned from the script/inline command, this will avoid reported failure of the script/inline command.
- **runElevated** – Optional, boolean, support for running commands and scripts with elevated permissions.
- **sha256Checksum** - Value of sha256 checksum of the file, you generate this locally, and then Image Builder will checksum and validate.
    * To generate the sha256Checksum, using a PowerShell on Windows [Get-Hash](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-6)


### File customizer

The File customizer lets image builder download a file from a GitHub or Azure storage. If you have an image build pipeline that relies on build artifacts, you can then set the file customizer to download from the build share, and move the artifacts into the image.  

```json
     "customize": [ 
         { 
            "type": "File", 
             "name": "<name>", 
             "sourceUri": "<source location>",
             "destination": "<destination>",
             "sha256Checksum": "<sha256 checksum>"
         }
     ]
```

OS support: Linux and Windows 

File customizer properties:

- **sourceUri** - an accessible storage endpoint, this can be GitHub or Azure storage. You can only download one file, not an entire directory. If you need to download a directory, use a compressed file, then uncompress it using the Shell or PowerShell customizers. 
- **destination** – this is the full destination path and file name. Any referenced path and subdirectories must exist, use the Shell or PowerShell customizers to set these up beforehand. You can use the script customizers to create the path. 

This is supported by Windows directories and Linux paths, but there are some differences: 
- Linux OS’s – the only path Image builder can write to is /tmp.
- Windows – No path restriction, but the path must exist.
 
 
If there is an error trying to download the file, or put it in a specified directory, the customize step will fail, and this will be in the customization.log.

> [!NOTE]
> The file customizer is only suitable for small file downloads, < 20MB. For larger file downloads use a script or inline command, the use code to download files, such as, Linux `wget` or `curl`, Windows, `Invoke-WebRequest`.

Files in the File customizer can be downloaded from Azure Storage using [MSI](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/tree/master/quickquickstarts/7_Creating_Custom_Image_using_MSI_to_Access_Storage).

### Windows Update Customizer
This customizer is built on the [community Windows Update Provisioner](https://packer.io/docs/provisioners/community-supported.html) for Packer, which is an open source project maintained by the Packer community. Microsoft tests and validate the provisioner with the Image Builder service, and will support investigating issues with it, and work to resolve issues, however the open source project is not officially supported by Microsoft. For detailed documentation on and help with the Windows Update Provisioner please see the project repository.

```json
     "customize": [
            {
                "type": "WindowsUpdate",
                "searchCriteria": "IsInstalled=0",
                "filters": [
                    "exclude:$_.Title -like '*Preview*'",
                    "include:$true"
                            ],
                "updateLimit": 20
            }
               ], 
OS support: Windows
```

Customize properties:
- **type**  – WindowsUpdate.
- **searchCriteria** - Optional, defines which type of updates are installed (Recommended, Important etc.), BrowseOnly=0 and IsInstalled=0 (Recommended) is the default.
- **filters** – Optional, allows you to specify a filter to include or exclude updates.
- **updateLimit** – Optional, defines how many updates can be installed, default 1000.
 
 

### Generalize 
By default, Azure Image Builder will also run ‘deprovision’ code at the end of each image customization phase, to ‘generalize’ the image. Generalizing is a process where the image is set up so it can be reused to create multiple VMs. For Windows VMs, Azure Image Builder uses Sysprep. For Linux, Azure Image Builder runs ‘waagent -deprovision’. 

The commands Image Builder users to generalize may not be suitable for every situation, so Azure Image Builder will allow you to customize this command, if needed. 

If you are migrating existing customization, and you are using different Sysprep/waagent commands, you can use the Image Builder generic commands, and if the VM creation fails, use your own Sysprep or waagent commands.

If Azure Image Builder creates a Windows custom image successfully, and you create a VM from it, then find that the VM creation fails or does not complete successfully, you will need to review the Windows Server Sysprep documentation or raise a support request with the Windows Server Sysprep Customer Services Support team, who can troubleshoot and advise on the correct Sysprep usage.


#### Default Sysprep command
```powershell
Write-Output '>>> Waiting for GA Service (RdAgent) to start ...'
while ((Get-Service RdAgent).Status -ne 'Running') { Start-Sleep -s 5 }
Write-Output '>>> Waiting for GA Service (WindowsAzureTelemetryService) to start ...'
while ((Get-Service WindowsAzureTelemetryService) -and ((Get-Service WindowsAzureTelemetryService).Status -ne 'Running')) { Start-Sleep -s 5 }
Write-Output '>>> Waiting for GA Service (WindowsAzureGuestAgent) to start ...'
while ((Get-Service WindowsAzureGuestAgent).Status -ne 'Running') { Start-Sleep -s 5 }
Write-Output '>>> Sysprepping VM ...'
if( Test-Path $Env:SystemRoot\system32\Sysprep\unattend.xml ) {
  Remove-Item $Env:SystemRoot\system32\Sysprep\unattend.xml -Force
}
& $Env:SystemRoot\System32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe /oobe /generalize /quiet /quit
while($true) {
  $imageState = (Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\State).ImageState
  Write-Output $imageState
  if ($imageState -eq 'IMAGE_STATE_GENERALIZE_RESEAL_TO_OOBE') { break }
  Start-Sleep -s 5
}
Write-Output '>>> Sysprep complete ...'
```
#### Default Linux deprovision command

```bash
/usr/sbin/waagent -force -deprovision+user && export HISTSIZE=0 && sync
```

#### Overriding the Commands
To override the commands, use the PowerShell or Shell script provisioners to create the command files with the exact file name, and put them in the correct directories:

* Windows: c:\DeprovisioningScript.ps1
* Linux: /tmp/DeprovisioningScript.sh

Image Builder will read these commands, these are written out to the AIB logs, ‘customization.log’. See [troubleshooting](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/master/troubleshootingaib.md#collecting-and-reviewing-aib-logs) on how to collect logs.
 
## Properties: distribute

Azure Image Builder supports three distribution targets: 

- **managedImage** - managed image.
- **sharedImage** - Shared Image Gallery.
- **VHD** - VHD in a storage account.

You can distribute an image to both of the target types in the same configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The default AIB sysprep command does not include "/mode:vm", however this maybe required when create images that will have the HyperV role installed. If you need to add this command argument, you must override the sysprep command.

Because you can have more than one target to distribute to, Image Builder maintains a state for every distribution target that can be accessed by querying the `runOutputName`.  The `runOutputName` is an object you can query post distribution for information about that distribution. For example, you can query the location of the VHD, or regions where the image version was replicated to, or SIG Image version created. This is a property of every distribution target. The `runOutputName` must be unique to each distribution target. Here is an example, this is querying a Shared Image Gallery distribution:

```bash
subscriptionID=<subcriptionID>
imageResourceGroup=<resourceGroup of image template>
runOutputName=<runOutputName>

az resource show \
        --ids "/subscriptions/$subscriptionID/resourcegroups/$imageResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates/ImageTemplateLinuxRHEL77/runOutputs/$runOutputName"  \
        --api-version=2020-02-14
```

Output:
```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxx/resourcegroups/rheltest/providers/Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates/ImageTemplateLinuxRHEL77/runOutputs/rhel77",
  "identity": null,
  "kind": null,
  "location": null,
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "rhel77",
  "plan": null,
  "properties": {
    "artifactId": "/subscriptions/xxxxxx/resourceGroups/aibDevOpsImg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/devOpsSIG/images/rhel/versions/0.24105.52755",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "resourceGroup": "rheltest",
  "sku": null,
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates/runOutputs"
}
```

### Distribute: managedImage

The image output will be a managed image resource.

```json
"distribute": [
        {
"type":"managedImage",
       "imageId": "<resource ID>",
       "location": "<region>",
       "runOutputName": "<name>",
       "artifactTags": {
            "<name": "<value>",
             "<name>": "<value>"
               }
         }]
```
 
Distribute properties:
- **type** – managedImage 
- **imageId** – Resource ID of the destination image, expected format: /subscriptions/\<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/\<destinationResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/\<imageName>
- **location** - location of the managed image.  
- **runOutputName** – unique name for identifying the distribution.  
- **artifactTags** - Optional user specified key value pair tags.
 
 
> [!NOTE]
> The destination resource group must exist.
> If you want the image distributed to a different region, it will increase the deployment time . 

### Distribute: sharedImage 
The Azure Shared Image Gallery is a new Image Management service that allows managing of image region replication, versioning and sharing custom images. Azure Image Builder supports distributing with this service, so you can distribute images to regions supported by Shared Image Galleries. 
 
A Shared Image Gallery is made up of: 
 
- Gallery - Container for multiple shared images. A gallery is deployed in one region.
- Image definitions - a conceptual grouping for images. 
- Image versions - this is an image type used for deploying a VM or scale set. Image versions can be replicated to other regions where VMs need to be deployed.
 
Before you can distribute to the Image Gallery, you must create a gallery and an image definition, see [Shared images](../shared-images-cli.md). 

```json
{
    "type": "sharedImage",
    "galleryImageId": "<resource ID>",
    "runOutputName": "<name>",
    "artifactTags": {
        "<name>": "<value>",
        "<name>": "<value>"
    },
    "replicationRegions": [
        "<region where the gallery is deployed>",
        "<region>"
    ]
}
``` 

Distribute properties for shared image galleries:

- **type** - sharedImage  
- **galleryImageId** – ID of the shared image gallery, this can specified in two formats:
    * Automatic versioning - Image Builder will generate a monotonic version number for you, this is useful for when you want to keep rebuilding images from the same template: The format is: `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<sharedImageGalleryName>/images/<imageGalleryName>`.
    * Explicit versioning - You can pass in the version number you want image builder to use. The format is:
    `/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<sharedImageGalName>/images/<imageDefName>/versions/<version e.g. 1.1.1>`

- **runOutputName** – unique name for identifying the distribution.  
- **artifactTags** - Optional user specified key value pair tags.
- **replicationRegions** - Array of regions for replication. One of the regions must be the region where the Gallery is deployed. Adding regions will mean an increase of build time, as the build does not complete until the replication has completed.
- **excludeFromLatest** (optional) This allows you to mark the image version you create not be used as the latest version in the SIG definition, the default is 'false'.
- **storageAccountType** (optional) AIB supports specifying these types of storage for the image version that is to be created:
    * "Standard_LRS"
    * "Standard_ZRS"


> [!NOTE]
> If the image template and referenced `image definition` are not in the same location, you will see additional time to create images. Image Builder currently does not have a `location` parameter for the image version resource, we take it from its parent `image definition`. For example, if an image definition is in westus and you want the image version replicated to eastus, a  blob is copied to to westus, from this, an image version resource in westus is created, and then replicate to eastus. To avoid the additional replication time, ensure the `image definition` and image template are in the same location.


### Distribute: VHD  
You can output to a VHD. You can then copy the VHD, and use it to publish to Azure MarketPlace, or use with Azure Stack.  

```json
{ 
    "type": "VHD",
    "runOutputName": "<VHD name>",
    "tags": {
        "<name": "<value>",
        "<name>": "<value>"
    }
}
```
 
OS Support: Windows  and Linux

Distribute VHD parameters:

- **type** - VHD.
- **runOutputName** – unique name for identifying the distribution.  
- **tags** - Optional user specified key value pair tags.
 
Azure Image Builder does not allow the user to specify a storage account location, but you can query the status of the `runOutputs` to get the location.  

```azurecli-interactive
az resource show \
   --ids "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourcegroups/<imageResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates/<imageTemplateName>/runOutputs/<runOutputName>"  | grep artifactUri 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Once the VHD has been created, copy it to a different location, as soon as possible. The VHD is stored in a storage account in the temporary resource group created when the image template is submitted to the Azure Image Builder service. If you delete the image template, then you will lose the VHD. 

## Image Template Operations

### Starting an Image Build
To start a build, you need to invoke 'Run' on the Image Template resource, examples of `run` commands:

```PowerShell
Invoke-AzResourceAction -ResourceName $imageTemplateName -ResourceGroupName $imageResourceGroup -ResourceType Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates -ApiVersion "2020-02-14" -Action Run -Force
```


```bash
az resource invoke-action \
     --resource-group $imageResourceGroup \
     --resource-type  Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates \
     -n helloImageTemplateLinux01 \
     --action Run 
```

### Cancelling an Image Build
If you are running an image build that you believe is incorrect, waiting for user input, or you feel will never complete successfully, then you can cancel the build.

The build can be canceled any time. If the distribution phase has started you can still cancel, but you will need to clean up any images that may not be completed. The cancel command does not wait for cancel to complete, please monitor `lastrunstatus.runstate` for canceling progress, using these status [commands](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/master/troubleshootingaib.md#get-statuserror-of-the-template-submission-or-template-build-status).


Examples of `cancel` commands:

```powerShell
Invoke-AzResourceAction -ResourceName $imageTemplateName -ResourceGroupName $imageResourceGroup -ResourceType Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates -ApiVersion "2020-02-14" -Action Cancel -Force
```

```bash
az resource invoke-action \
     --resource-group $imageResourceGroup \
     --resource-type  Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages/imageTemplates \
     -n helloImageTemplateLinux01 \
     --action Cancel 
```

## Next steps

There are sample .json files for different scenarios in the [Azure Image Builder GitHub](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder).
