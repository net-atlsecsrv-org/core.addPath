# Azure Metadata Service: Scheduled Events for Linux VMs

Scheduled Events is an Azure Metadata Service that gives your application time to prepare for virtual machine (VM) maintenance. It provides information about upcoming maintenance events (for example, reboot) so that your application can prepare for them and limit disruption. It's available for all Azure Virtual Machines types, including PaaS and IaaS on both Windows and Linux. 

For information about Scheduled Events on Windows, see [Scheduled Events for Windows VMs](../windows/scheduled-events.md).

> [!Note] 
> Scheduled Events is generally available in all Azure Regions. See [Version and Region Availability](#version-and-region-availability) for latest release information.

## Why use Scheduled Events?

Many applications can benefit from time to prepare for VM maintenance. The time can be used to perform application-specific tasks that improve availability, reliability, and serviceability, including: 

- Checkpoint and restore.
- Connection draining.
- Primary replica failover.
- Removal from a load balancer pool.
- Event logging.
- Graceful shutdown.

With Scheduled Events, your application can discover when maintenance will occur and trigger tasks to limit its impact.  

Scheduled Events provides events in the following use cases:

- [Platform initiated maintenance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/maintenance-and-updates) (for example, VM reboot, live migration or memory preserving updates for host)
- Degraded hardware
- User-initiated maintenance (for example, a user restarts or redeploys a VM)
- [Low-Priority VM eviction](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/low-priority-scale-sets) in scale sets

## The Basics  

  Metadata Service exposes information about running VMs by using a REST endpoint that's accessible from within the VM. The information is available via a nonroutable IP so that it's not exposed outside the VM.

### Scope
Scheduled events are delivered to:

- Standalone Virtual Machines.
- All the VMs in a cloud service.
- All the VMs in an availability set.
- All the VMs in a scale set placement group. 

As a result, check the `Resources` field in the event to identify which VMs are affected.

### Endpoint Discovery
For VNET enabled VMs, Metadata Service is available from a static nonroutable IP, `169.254.169.254`. The full endpoint for the latest version of Scheduled Events is: 

 > `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2017-11-01`

If the VM is not created within a Virtual Network, the default cases for cloud services and classic VMs, additional logic is required to discover the IP address to use. 
To learn how to [discover the host endpoint](https://github.com/azure-samples/virtual-machines-python-scheduled-events-discover-endpoint-for-non-vnet-vm), see this sample.

### Version and Region Availability
The Scheduled Events service is versioned. Versions are mandatory; the current version is `2017-11-01`.

| Version | Release Type | Regions | Release Notes | 
| - | - | - | - | 
| 2017-11-01 | General Availability | All | <li> Added support for Low-priority VM eviction EventType 'Preempt'<br> | 
| 2017-08-01 | General Availability | All | <li> Removed prepended underscore from resource names for IaaS VMs<br><li>Metadata header requirement enforced for all requests | 
| 2017-03-01 | Preview | All | <li>Initial release


> [!NOTE] 
> Previous preview releases of Scheduled Events supported {latest} as the api-version. This format is no longer supported and will be deprecated in the future.

### Enabling and Disabling Scheduled Events
Scheduled Events is enabled for your service the first time you make a request for events. You should expect a delayed response in your first call of up to two minutes.

Scheduled Events is disabled for your service if it does not make a request for 24 hours.

### User-initiated Maintenance
User-initiated VM maintenance via the Azure portal, API, CLI, or PowerShell results in a scheduled event. You then can test the maintenance preparation logic in your application, and your application can prepare for user-initiated maintenance.

If you restart a VM, an event with the type `Reboot` is scheduled. If you redeploy a VM, an event with the type `Redeploy` is scheduled.

## Use the API

### Headers
When you query Metadata Service, you must provide the header `Metadata:true` to ensure the request wasn't unintentionally redirected. The `Metadata:true` header is required for all scheduled events requests. Failure to include the header in the request results in a "Bad Request" response from Metadata Service.

### Query for events
You can query for scheduled events by making the following call:

#### Bash
```
curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2017-08-01
```

A response contains an array of scheduled events. An empty array means that currently no events are scheduled.
In the case where there are scheduled events, the response contains an array of events. 
```
{
    "DocumentIncarnation": {IncarnationID},
    "Events": [
        {
            "EventId": {eventID},
            "EventType": "Reboot" | "Redeploy" | "Freeze" | "Preempt",
            "ResourceType": "VirtualMachine",
            "Resources": [{resourceName}],
            "EventStatus": "Scheduled" | "Started",
            "NotBefore": {timeInUTC},              
        }
    ]
}
```

### Event Properties
|Property  |  Description |
| - | - |
| EventId | Globally unique identifier for this event. <br><br> Example: <br><ul><li>602d9444-d2cd-49c7-8624-8643e7171297  |
| EventType | Impact this event causes. <br><br> Values: <br><ul><li> `Freeze`: The Virtual Machine is scheduled to pause for a few seconds. CPU and network connectivity may be suspended, but there is no impact on memory or open files.<li>`Reboot`: The Virtual Machine is scheduled for reboot (non-persistent memory is lost). <li>`Redeploy`: The Virtual Machine is scheduled to move to another node (ephemeral disks are lost). <li>`Preempt`: The Low-priority Virtual Machine is being deleted (ephemeral disks are lost).|
| ResourceType | Type of resource this event affects. <br><br> Values: <ul><li>`VirtualMachine`|
| Resources| List of resources this event affects. The list is guaranteed to contain machines from at most one [update domain](manage-availability.md), but it might not contain all machines in the UD. <br><br> Example: <br><ul><li> ["FrontEnd_IN_0", "BackEnd_IN_0"] |
| EventStatus | Status of this event. <br><br> Values: <ul><li>`Scheduled`: This event is scheduled to start after the time specified in the `NotBefore` property.<li>`Started`: This event has started.</ul> No `Completed` or similar status is ever provided. The event is no longer returned when the event is finished.
| NotBefore| Time after which this event can start. <br><br> Example: <br><ul><li> Mon, 19 Sep 2016 18:29:47 GMT  |

### Event Scheduling
Each event is scheduled a minimum amount of time in the future based on the event type. This time is reflected in an event's `NotBefore` property. 

|EventType  | Minimum notice |
| - | - |
| Freeze| 15 minutes |
| Reboot | 15 minutes |
| Redeploy | 10 minutes |
| Preempt | 30 seconds |

### Start an event 

After you learn of an upcoming event and finish your logic for graceful shutdown, you can approve the outstanding event by making a `POST` call to Metadata Service with `EventId`. This call indicates to Azure that it can shorten the minimum notification time (when possible). 

The following JSON sample is expected in the `POST` request body. The request should contain a list of `StartRequests`. Each `StartRequest` contains `EventId` for the event you want to expedite:
```
{
	"StartRequests" : [
		{
			"EventId": {EventId}
		}
	]
}
```

#### Bash sample
```
curl -H Metadata:true -X POST -d '{"StartRequests": [{"EventId": "f020ba2e-3bc0-4c40-a10b-86575a9eabd5"}]}' http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2017-11-01
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Acknowledging an event allows the event to proceed for all `Resources` in the event, not just the VM that acknowledges the event. Therefore, you can choose to elect a leader to coordinate the acknowledgement, which might be as simple as the first machine in the `Resources` field.

## Python sample 

The following sample queries Metadata Service for scheduled events and approves each outstanding event:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import json
import urllib2
import socket
import sys

metadata_url = "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2017-11-01"
headers = "{Metadata:true}"
this_host = socket.gethostname()

def get_scheduled_events():
   req = urllib2.Request(metadata_url)
   req.add_header('Metadata', 'true')
   resp = urllib2.urlopen(req)
   data = json.loads(resp.read())
   return data

def handle_scheduled_events(data):
    for evt in data['Events']:
        eventid = evt['EventId']
        status = evt['EventStatus']
        resources = evt['Resources']
        eventtype = evt['EventType']
        resourcetype = evt['ResourceType']
        notbefore = evt['NotBefore'].replace(" ","_")
        if this_host in resources:
            print "+ Scheduled Event. This host " + this_host + " is scheduled for " + eventtype + " not before " + notbefore
            # Add logic for handling events here


def main():
   data = get_scheduled_events()
   handle_scheduled_events(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
  sys.exit(0)
```
