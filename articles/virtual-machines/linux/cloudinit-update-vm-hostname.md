# Use cloud-init to set hostname for a Linux VM in Azure
This article shows you how to use [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io) to configure a specific hostname on a virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine scale sets (VMSS) at provisioning time in Azure. These cloud-init scripts run on first boot once the resources have been provisioned by Azure. For more information about how cloud-init works natively in Azure and the supported Linux distros, see [cloud-init overview](using-cloud-init.md)

## Set the hostname with cloud-init
By default, the hostname is the same as the VM name when you create a new virtual machine in Azure.  To run a cloud-init script to change this default hostname when you create a VM in Azure with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm), specify the cloud-init file with the `--custom-data` switch.  

To see upgrade process in action, create a file in your current shell named *cloud_init_hostname.txt* and paste the following configuration. For this example, create the file in the Cloud Shell not on your local machine. You can use any editor you wish. Enter `sensible-editor cloud_init_hostname.txt` to create the file and see a list of available editors. Choose #1 to use the **nano** editor. Make sure that the whole cloud-init file is copied correctly, especially the first line.  

```yaml
#cloud-config
hostname: myhostname
```

Before deploying this image, you need to create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Now, create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) and specify the cloud-init file with `--custom-data cloud_init_hostname.txt` as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name centos74 \
  --image OpenLogic:CentOS:7-CI:latest \
  --custom-data cloud_init_hostname.txt \
  --generate-ssh-keys 
```

Once created, the Azure CLI shows information about the VM. Use the `publicIpAddress` to SSH to your VM. Enter your own address as follows:

```bash
ssh <publicIpAddress>
```

To see the VM name, use the `hostname` command as follows:

```bash
hostname
```

The VM should report the hostname as that value set in the cloud-init file, as shown in the following example output:

```bash
myhostname
```
