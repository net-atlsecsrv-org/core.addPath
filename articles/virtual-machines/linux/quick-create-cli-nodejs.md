# Create a Linux VM using the Azure classic CLI

This article shows how to quickly deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) on Azure by using the `azure vm quick-create` command in the Azure command-line interface (CLI). The `quick-create` command deploys a VM inside a basic, secure infrastructure that you can use to prototype or test a concept rapidly.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a VM using the Azure CLI, see [Create a VM with the Azure CLI](../windows/quick-create-cli.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

You can also quickly deploy a Linux VM by using the [Azure portal](quick-create-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

The article requires an [SSH public and private key files](mac-create-ssh-keys.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Quick commands

The following example shows how to deploy a CoreOS VM and attach your Secure Shell (SSH) key (your arguments might be different):

```azurecli
azure vm quick-create -M ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -Q CoreOS
```

## Detailed walkthrough

The following walkthrough has an UbuntuLTS VM being deployed, step by step, with explanations of what each step is doing.

## VM quick-create aliases

A quick way to choose a distribution is to use the Azure CLI aliases mapped to the most common OS distributions. The following table lists the aliases (as of Azure CLI version 0.10). All deployments that use `quick-create` default to VMs that are backed by solid-state drive (SSD) storage, which offers faster provisioning and high-performance disk access. (These aliases represent a tiny portion of the available distributions on Azure. Find more images in the Azure Marketplace by [searching for an image in PowerShell](../windows/cli-ps-findimage.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json), [on the web](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/virtual-machines/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio), or [upload your own custom image](create-upload-generic.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).)

| Alias | Publisher | Offer | SKU | Version |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| CentOS |OpenLogic |CentOS |7.2 |latest |
| CoreOS |CoreOS |CoreOS |Stable |latest |
| Debian |credativ |Debian |8 |latest |
| openSUSE |SUSE |openSUSE |13.2 |latest |
| RHEL |Red Hat |RHEL |7.2 |latest |
| UbuntuLTS |Canonical |Ubuntu Server |14.04.4-LTS |latest |

The following sections use the `UbuntuLTS` alias for the **ImageURN** option (`-Q`) to deploy an Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS Server.

The previous `quick-create` example only called out the `-M` flag to identify the SSH public key to upload while disabling SSH passwords, so you are prompted for the following arguments:

* resource group name (any string is typically fine for your first Azure resource group)
* VM name
* location (`westus` or `westeurope` are good defaults)
* linux (to let Azure know which OS you want)
* username

The following example specifies all the values so that no further prompting is required. So long as you have an `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` as a ssh-rsa format public key file, it works as is:

```azurecli
azure vm quick-create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVM \
  --location westus \
  --os-type Linux \
  --admin-username myAdminUser \
  --ssh-publickey-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
  --image-urn UbuntuLTS
```

The output should look like the following output block:

## Log in to the new VM
Log in to your VM by using the public IP address listed in the output. You can also use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that's listed:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ahmet@138.91.247.29
```

The login process should look something like the following output block:

```bash
Warning: Permanently added '138.91.247.29' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

## Next steps
The `azure vm quick-create` command is the way to quickly deploy a VM so you can log in to a bash shell and get working. However, using `vm quick-create` does not give you extensive control nor does it enable you to create a more complex environment.  To deploy a Linux VM that's customized for your infrastructure, you can follow any of these articles:

* [Create your own custom environment for a Linux VM using Azure CLI commands directly](create-cli-complete.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json)
* [Create an SSH Secured Linux VM on Azure using templates](create-ssh-secured-vm-from-template.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json)
