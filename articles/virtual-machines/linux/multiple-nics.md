# How to create a Linux virtual machine in Azure with multiple network interface cards


This article details how to create a VM with multiple NICs with the Azure CLI.

## Create supporting resources
Install the latest [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) and log in to an Azure account using [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index).

In the following examples, replace example parameter names with your own values. Example parameter names included *myResourceGroup*, *mystorageaccount*, and *myVM*.

First, create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Create the virtual network with [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet). The following example creates a virtual network named *myVnet* and subnet named *mySubnetFrontEnd*:

```azurecli
az network vnet create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVnet \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name mySubnetFrontEnd \
    --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
```

Create a subnet for the back-end traffic with [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet). The following example creates a subnet named *mySubnetBackEnd*:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --vnet-name myVnet \
    --name mySubnetBackEnd \
    --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24
```

Create a network security group with [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg). The following example creates a network security group named *myNetworkSecurityGroup*:

```azurecli
az network nsg create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myNetworkSecurityGroup
```

## Create and configure multiple NICs
Create two NICs with [az network nic create](/cli/azure/network/nic). The following example creates two NICs, named *myNic1* and *myNic2*, connected the network security group, with one NIC connecting to each subnet:

```azurecli
az network nic create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myNic1 \
    --vnet-name myVnet \
    --subnet mySubnetFrontEnd \
    --network-security-group myNetworkSecurityGroup
az network nic create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myNic2 \
    --vnet-name myVnet \
    --subnet mySubnetBackEnd \
    --network-security-group myNetworkSecurityGroup
```

## Create a VM and attach the NICs
When you create the VM, specify the NICs you created with `--nics`. You also need to take care when you select the VM size. There are limits for the total number of NICs that you can add to a VM. Read more about [Linux VM sizes](sizes.md).

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm). The following example creates a VM named *myVM*:

```azurecli
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --size Standard_DS3_v2 \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --nics myNic1 myNic2
```

Add routing tables to the guest OS by completing the steps in [Configure the guest OS for multiple NICs](#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

## Add a NIC to a VM
The previous steps created a VM with multiple NICs. You can also add NICs to an existing VM with the Azure CLI. Different [VM sizes](sizes.md) support a varying number of NICs, so size your VM accordingly. If needed, you can [resize a VM](change-vm-size.md).

Create another NIC with [az network nic create](/cli/azure/network/nic). The following example creates a NIC named *myNic3* connected to the back-end subnet and network security group created in the previous steps:

```azurecli
az network nic create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myNic3 \
    --vnet-name myVnet \
    --subnet mySubnetBackEnd \
    --network-security-group myNetworkSecurityGroup
```

To add a NIC to an existing VM, first deallocate the VM with [az vm deallocate](/cli/azure/vm). The following example deallocates the VM named *myVM*:


```azurecli
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

Add the NIC with [az vm nic add](/cli/azure/vm/nic). The following example adds *myNic3* to *myVM*:

```azurecli
az vm nic add \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --vm-name myVM \
    --nics myNic3
```

Start the VM with [az vm start](/cli/azure/vm):

```azurecli
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

Add routing tables to the guest OS by completing the steps in [Configure the guest OS for multiple NICs](#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

## Remove a NIC from a VM
To remove a NIC from an existing VM, first deallocate the VM with [az vm deallocate](/cli/azure/vm). The following example deallocates the VM named *myVM*:

```azurecli
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

Remove the NIC with [az vm nic remove](/cli/azure/vm/nic). The following example removes *myNic3* from *myVM*:

```azurecli
az vm nic remove \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --vm-name myVM \
    --nics myNic3
```

Start the VM with [az vm start](/cli/azure/vm):

```azurecli
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```


## Create multiple NICs using Resource Manager templates
Azure Resource Manager templates use declarative JSON files to define your environment. You can read an [overview of Azure Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md). Resource Manager templates provide a way to create multiple instances of a resource during deployment, such as creating multiple NICs. You use *copy* to specify the number of instances to create:

```json
"copy": {
    "name": "multiplenics"
    "count": "[parameters('count')]"
}
```

Read more about [creating multiple instances using *copy*](../../resource-group-create-multiple.md). 

You can also use a `copyIndex()` to then append a number to a resource name, which allows you to create `myNic1`, `myNic2`, etc. The following shows an example of appending the index value:

```json
"name": "[concat('myNic', copyIndex())]", 
```

You can read a complete example of [creating multiple NICs using Resource Manager templates](../../virtual-network/template-samples.md).

Add routing tables to the guest OS by completing the steps in [Configure the guest OS for multiple NICs](#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

## Configure guest OS for multiple NICs

The previous steps created a virtual network and subnet, attached NICs, then created a VM. A public IP address and network security group rules that allow SSH traffic were not created. To configure the guest OS for multiple NICs, you need to allow remote connections and run commands locally on the VM.

To allow SSH traffic, create a network security group rule with [az network nsg rule create](/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#az-network-nsg-rule-create) as follows:

```azurecli
az network nsg rule create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --nsg-name myNetworkSecurityGroup \
    --name allow_ssh \
    --priority 101 \
    --destination-port-ranges 22
```

Create a public IP address with [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create) and assign it to the first NIC with [az network nic ip-config update](/cli/azure/network/nic/ip-config#az-network-nic-ip-config-update):

```azurecli
az network public-ip create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPublicIP

az network nic ip-config update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --nic-name myNic1 \
    --name ipconfig1 \
    --public-ip myPublicIP
```

To view the public IP address of the VM, use [az vm show](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-show) as follows::

```azurecli
az vm show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM -d --query publicIps -o tsv
```

Now SSH to the public IP address of your VM. The default username provided in a previous step was *azureuser*. Provide your own username and public IP address:

```bash
ssh azureuser@137.117.58.232
```

To send to or from a secondary network interface, you have to manually add persistent routes to the operating system for each secondary network interface. In this article, *eth1* is the secondary interface. Instructions for adding persistent routes to the operating system vary by distro. See documentation for your distro for instructions.

When adding the route to the operating system, the gateway address is *.1* for whichever subnet the network interface is in. For example, if the network interface is assigned the address *10.0.2.4*, the gateway you specify for the route is *10.0.2.1*. You can define a specific network for the route's destination, or specify a destination of *0.0.0.0*, if you want all traffic for the interface to go through the specified gateway. The gateway for each subnet is managed by the virtual network.

Once you've added the route for a secondary interface, verify that the route is in your route table with `route -n`. The following example output is for the route table that has the two network interfaces added to the VM in this article:

```bash
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         10.0.1.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         10.0.2.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth1
10.0.1.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
10.0.2.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
168.63.129.16   10.0.1.1        255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
169.254.169.254 10.0.1.1        255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
```

Confirm that the route you added persists across reboots by checking your route table again after a reboot. To test connectivity, you can enter the following command, for example, where *eth1* is the name of a secondary network interface:

```bash
ping bing.com -c 4 -I eth1
```

## Next steps
Review [Linux VM sizes](sizes.md) when trying to creating a VM with multiple NICs. Pay attention to the maximum number of NICs each VM size supports.

To further secure your VMs, use just in time VM access. This feature opens network security group rules for SSH traffic when needed, and for a defined period of time. For more information, see [Manage virtual machine access using just in time](../../security-center/security-center-just-in-time.md).
