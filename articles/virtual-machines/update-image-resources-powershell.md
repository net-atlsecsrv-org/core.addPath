# List, update, and delete image resources using PowerShell 

You can manage your shared image gallery resources using Azure PowerShell.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-gallery-list-ps.md](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-gallery-list-ps.md)]

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-shared-images-update-delete-ps](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-shared-images-update-delete-ps.md)]

## Next steps

[Azure Image Builder (preview)](./linux/image-builder-overview.md) can help automate image version creation, you can even use it to update and [create a new image version from an existing image version](./linux/image-builder-gallery-update-image-version.md).
