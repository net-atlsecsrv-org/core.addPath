# Storage optimized virtual machine sizes

Storage optimized VM sizes offer high disk throughput and IO, and are ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases.  Examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, Cloudera, and Redis. This article provides information about the number of vCPUs, data disks, and NICs as well as local storage throughput and network bandwidth for each optimized size.

The [Lsv2-series](lsv2-series.md) features high throughput, low latency, directly mapped local NVMe storage running on the [AMD EPYC<sup>TM</sup> 7551 processor](https://www.amd.com/en/products/epyc-7000-series) with an all core boost of 2.55GHz and a max boost of 3.0GHz. The Lsv2-series VMs come in sizes from 8 to 80 vCPU in a simultaneous multi-threading configuration.  There is 8 GiB of memory per vCPU, and one 1.92TB NVMe SSD M.2 device per 8 vCPUs, with up to 19.2TB (10x1.92TB) available on the L80s v2.
