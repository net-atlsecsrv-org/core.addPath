# H-series

H-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by high CPU frequencies or large memory per core requirements. H-series VMs feature 8 or 16 Intel Xeon E5 2667 v3 processor cores, up to 14 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no hyperthreading. H-series features 56 Gb/sec Mellanox FDR InfiniBand in a non-blocking fat tree configuration for consistent RDMA performance. H-series VMs support Intel MPI 5.x and MS-MPI.

## Supported OS images (Linux)
 
The Azure Marketplace has many Linux distributions that support RDMA connectivity:
  
* **CentOS-based HPC** - For non-SR-IOV enabled VMs, CentOS-based version 6.5 HPC or a later version, up to 7.5 are suitable. For H-series VMs, versions 7.1 to 7.5 are recommended. RDMA drivers and Intel MPI 5.1 are installed on the VM.
  For SR-IOV VMs, CentOS-HPC 7.6 comes optimized and pre-loaded with the RDMA drivers and various MPI packages installed.
  For other RHEL/CentOS VM images, add the InfiniBandLinux extension to enable InfiniBand. This Linux VM extension installs Mellanox OFED drivers (on SR-IOV VMs) for RDMA connectivity. The following PowerShell cmdlet installs the latest version (version 1.0) of the InfiniBandDriverLinux extension on an existing RDMA-capable VM. The RDMA-capable VM is named *myVM* and is deployed in the resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *West US* region as follows:

  ```powershell
  Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "westus" -VMName "myVM" -ExtensionName "InfiniBandDriverLinux" -Publisher "Microsoft.HpcCompute" -Type "InfiniBandDriverLinux" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.0"
  ```
  Alternatively, VM extensions can be included in Azure Resource Manager templates for easy deployment with the following JSON element:
  ```json
  "properties":{
  "publisher": "Microsoft.HpcCompute",
  "type": "InfiniBandDriverLinux",
  "typeHandlerVersion": "1.0",
  } 
  ```
  
  The following command installs the latest version 1.0 InfiniBandDriverLinux extension on all RDMA-capable VMs in an existing virtual machine scale set named *myVMSS* deployed in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*:
  ```powershell
  $VMSS = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myVMSS"
  Add-AzVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $VMSS -Name "InfiniBandDriverLinux" -Publisher "Microsoft.HpcCompute" -Type "InfiniBandDriverLinux" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.0"
  Update-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "MyVMSS" -VirtualMachineScaleSet $VMSS
  Update-AzVmssInstance -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myVMSS" -InstanceId "*"
  ```
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > On the CentOS-based HPC images, kernel updates are disabled in the **yum** configuration file. This is because Linux RDMA drivers are distributed as an RPM package, and driver updates might not work if the kernel is updated.
  >
  

* **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server** - SLES 12 SP3 for HPC, SLES 12 SP3 for HPC (Premium), SLES 12 SP1 for HPC, SLES 12 SP1 for HPC (Premium), SLES 12 SP4 and SLES 15. RDMA drivers are installed and Intel MPI packages are distributed on the VM. Install MPI by running the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo rpm -v -i --nodeps /opt/intelMPI/intel_mpi_packages/*.rpm
  ```
  
* **Ubuntu** - Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS. Configure RDMA drivers on the VM and register with Intel to download Intel MPI:
