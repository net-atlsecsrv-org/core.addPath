# Create a Shared Image Gallery with the Azure CLI

A [Shared Image Gallery](./linux/shared-image-galleries.md) simplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. 

The Shared Image Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with.

## Next steps

Create an image version from a [VM](image-version-vm-cli.md), or a [managed image](image-version-managed-image-cli.md) using the Azure CLI.

For more information about Shared Image Galleries, see the [Overview](./linux/shared-image-galleries.md). If you run into issues, see [Troubleshooting shared image galleries](troubleshooting-shared-images.md).
