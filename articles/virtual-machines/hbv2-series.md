# HBv2-series

HBv2-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by memory bandwidth, such as fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and reservoir simulation. HBv2 VMs feature 120 AMD EPYC 7742 processor cores, 4 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no simultaneous multithreading. Each HBv2 VM provides up to 340 GB/sec of memory bandwidth, and up to 4 teraFLOPS of FP64 compute.

Premium Storage: Supported

Live Migration: Not Supported

Memory Preserving Updates: Not Supported
