# Deploy Spot VMs using Azure PowerShell


Using [Spot VMs](../spot-vms.md) allows you to take advantage of our unused capacity at a significant cost savings. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict Spot VMs. Therefore, Spot VMs are great for workloads that can handle interruptions like batch processing jobs, dev/test environments, large compute workloads, and more.

Pricing for Spot VMs is variable, based on region and SKU. For more information, see VM pricing for [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) and [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/). For more information about setting the max price, see [Spot VMs - Pricing](../spot-vms.md#pricing).

You have option to set a max price you are willing to pay, per hour, for the VM. The max price for a Spot VM can be set in US dollars (USD), using up to 5 decimal places. For example, the value `0.98765`would be a max price of $0.98765 USD per hour. If you set the max price to be `-1`, the VM won't be evicted based on price. The price for the VM will be the current price for spot or the price for a standard VM, which ever is less, as long as there is capacity and quota available.


## Create the VM

Create a spotVM using [New-AzVmConfig](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig) to create the configuration. Include `-Priority Spot` and set `-MaxPrice` to either:
- `-1` so the VM is not evicted based on price.
- a dollar amount, up to 5 digits. For example, `-MaxPrice .98765` means that the VM will be deallocated once the price for a spotVM goes about $.98765 per hour.


This example creates a spotVM that will not be deallocated based on pricing (only when Azure needs the capacity back). The eviction policy is set to deallocate the VM, so that it can be restarted at a later time. If you want to delete the VM and the underlying disk when the VM is evicted, set `-EvictionPolicy` to `Delete` in `New-AzVMConfig`.


```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroup = "mySpotRG"
$location = "eastus"
$vmName = "mySpotVM"
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location
$subnetConfig = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
   -Name mySubnet -AddressPrefix 192.168.1.0/24
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
   -Location $location -Name MYvNET -AddressPrefix 192.168.0.0/16 `
   -Subnet $subnetConfig
$pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name "mypublicdns$(Get-Random)" -AllocationMethod Static -IdleTimeoutInMinutes 4
$nsgRuleRDP = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myNetworkSecurityGroupRuleRDP  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound -Priority 1000 -SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 3389 -Access Allow
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name myNetworkSecurityGroup -SecurityRules $nsgRuleRDP
$nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name myNic -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id -NetworkSecurityGroupId $nsg.Id

# Create a virtual machine configuration and set this to be a Spot VM

$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize Standard_D1 -Priority "Spot" -MaxPrice -1 -EvictionPolicy Deallocate | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows -ComputerName $vmName -Credential $cred | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer -Skus 2016-Datacenter -Version latest | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -Id $nic.Id

New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location -VM $vmConfig
```

After the VM is created, you can query to see the max price for all of the VMs in the resource group.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup | `
   Select-Object Name,@{Name="maxPrice"; Expression={$_.BillingProfile.MaxPrice}}
```

## Next steps

You can also create a Spot VM using the [Azure CLI](../linux/spot-cli.md), [portal](spot-portal.md) or a [template](../linux/spot-template.md).

If you encounter an error, see [Error codes](../error-codes-spot.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
