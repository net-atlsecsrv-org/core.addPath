# Create a snapshot using the portal or PowerShell

A snapshot is a full, read-only copy of a virtual hard drive (VHD). You can take a snapshot of an OS or data disk VHD to use as a backup, or to troubleshoot virtual machine (VM) issues.

If you are going to use the snapshot to create a new VM, we recommend that you cleanly shut down the VM before taking a snapshot, to clear out any processes that are in progress.

## Use the Azure portal 

To create a snapshot, complete the following steps: 
1.	On the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource**.
2. Search for and select **Snapshot**.
3. In the **Snapshot** window, select **Create**. The **Create snapshot** window appears.
4. Enter a **Name** for the snapshot.
5. Select an existing [Resource group](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#resource-groups) or enter the name of a new one. 
6. Select an Azure datacenter **Location**.  
7. For **Source disk**, select the managed disk to snapshot.
8. Select the **Account type** to use to store the snapshot. Select **Standard_HDD**, unless you need the snapshot to be stored on a high-performing disk.
9. Select **Create**.

## Use PowerShell

The following steps show how to copy the VHD disk and create the snapshot configuration. You can then take a snapshot of the disk by using the [New-AzSnapshot](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azsnapshot) cmdlet. 

 

1. Set some parameters: 

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $resourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup' 
   $location = 'eastus' 
   $vmName = 'myVM'
   $snapshotName = 'mySnapshot'  
   ```

2. Get the VM:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $vm = Get-AzVM `
       -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
       -Name $vmName
   ```

3. Create the snapshot configuration. For this example, the snapshot is of the OS disk:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $snapshot =  New-AzSnapshotConfig `
       -SourceUri $vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk.ManagedDisk.Id `
       -Location $location `
       -CreateOption copy
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you would like to store your snapshot in zone-resilient storage, create it in a region that supports [availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md) and include the `-SkuName Standard_ZRS` parameter.   
   
4. Take the snapshot:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   New-AzSnapshot `
       -Snapshot $snapshot `
       -SnapshotName $snapshotName `
       -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName 
   ```


## Next steps

Create a virtual machine from a snapshot by creating a managed disk from a snapshot and then attaching the new managed disk as the OS disk. For more information, see the sample in [Create a VM from a snapshot with PowerShell](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-vm-from-snapshot.md?toc=%2fpowershell%2fmodule%2ftoc.json).
