# Deploy VMs to dedicated hosts using the Azure PowerShell

This article guides you through how to create an Azure [dedicated host](dedicated-hosts.md) to host your virtual machines (VMs). 

Make sure that you have installed Azure PowerShell version 2.8.0 or later, and you are signed in to an Azure account in with `Connect-AzAccount`. 

## Limitations

- Virtual machine scale sets are not currently supported on dedicated hosts.
- The sizes and hardware types available for dedicated hosts vary by region. Refer to the host [pricing page](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing) to learn more.

## Create a host group

A **host group** is a resource that represents a collection of dedicated hosts. You create a host group in a region and an availability zone, and add hosts to it. When planning for high availability, there are additional options. You can use one or both of the following options with your dedicated hosts: 
- Span across multiple availability zones. In this case, you are required to have a host group in each of the zones you wish to use.
- Span across multiple fault domains which are mapped to physical racks. 
 
In either case, you are need to provide the fault domain count for your host group. If you do not want to span fault domains in your group, use a fault domain count of 1. 

You can also decide to use both availability zones and fault domains. This example creates a host group in zone 1, with 2 fault domains. 


```azurepowershell-interactive
$rgName = "myDHResourceGroup"
$location = "EastUS"

New-AzResourceGroup -Location $location -Name $rgName
$hostGroup = New-AzHostGroup `
   -Location $location `
   -Name myHostGroup `
   -PlatformFaultDomain 2 `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Zone 1
```

## Create a host

Now let's create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you are required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series as well as the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

For more information about the host SKUs and pricing, see [Azure Dedicated Host pricing](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing).

If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you will be asked to specify the fault domain for your host. In this example, we set the fault domain for the host to 1.


```azurepowershell-interactive
$dHost = New-AzHost `
   -HostGroupName $hostGroup.Name `
   -Location $location -Name myHost `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Sku DSv3-Type1 `
   -AutoReplaceOnFailure 1 `
   -PlatformFaultDomain 1
```

## Create a VM

Create a virtual machine on the dedicated host. 

If you specified an availability zone when creating your host group, you are required to use the same zone when creating the virtual machine. For this example, because our host group is in zone 1, we need to create the VM in zone 1.  


```azurepowershell-interactive
$cred = Get-Credential
New-AzVM `
   -Credential $cred `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Location $location `
   -Name myVM `
   -HostId $dhost.Id `
   -Image Win2016Datacenter `
   -Zone 1 `
   -Size Standard_D4s_v3
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you create a virtual machine on a host which does not have enough resources, the virtual machine will be created in a FAILED state. 

## Check the status of the host

You can check the host health status and how many virtual machines you can still deploy to the host using [GetAzHost](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azhost) with the `-InstanceView` parameter.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzHost `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Name myHost `
   -HostGroupName $hostGroup.Name `
   -InstanceView
```

The output will look similar to this:

```
ResourceGroupName      : myDHResourceGroup
PlatformFaultDomain    : 1
AutoReplaceOnFailure   : True

## Add an existing VM 

You can add an existing VM to a dedicated host, but the VM must first be Stop\Deallocated. Before you move a VM to a dedicated host, make sure that the VM configuration is supported:

- The VM size must be in the same size family as the dedicated host. For example, if your dedicated host is DSv3, then the VM size could be Standard_D4s_v3, but it could not be a Standard_A4_v2. 
- The VM needs to be located in same region as the dedicated host.
- The VM can't be part of a proximity placement group. Remove the VM from the proximity placement group before moving it to a dedicated host. For more information, see [Move a VM out of a proximity placement group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/proximity-placement-groups#move-an-existing-vm-out-of-a-proximity-placement-group)
- The VM can't be in an availability set.
- If the VM is in an availability zone, it must be the same availability zone as the host group. The availability zone settings for the VM and the host group must match.

Replace the values of the variables with your own information.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$vmRGName = "movetohost"
$vmName = "myVMtoHost"
$dhRGName = "myDHResourceGroup"
$dhGroupName = "myHostGroup"
$dhName = "myHost"

$myDH = Get-AzHost `
   -HostGroupName $dhGroupName `
   -ResourceGroupName $dhRGName `
   -Name $dhName
   
$myVM = Get-AzVM `
   -ResourceGroupName $vmRGName `
   -Name $vmName
   
$myVM.Host = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Models.SubResource

$myVM.Host.Id = "$myDH.Id"

Stop-AzVM `
   -ResourceGroupName $vmRGName `
   -Name $vmName -Force
   
Update-AzVM `
   -ResourceGroupName $vmRGName `
   -VM $myVM -Debug
   
Start-AzVM `
   -ResourceGroupName $vmRGName `
   -Name $vmName
```


## Clean up

You are being charged for your dedicated hosts even when no virtual machines are deployed. You should delete any hosts you are currently not using to save costs.  

You can only delete a host when there are no any longer virtual machines using it. Delete the VMs using [Remove-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvm).

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name myVM
```

After deleting the VMs, you can delete the host using [Remove-AzHost](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azhost).

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzHost -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name myHost
```

Once you have deleted all of your hosts, you may delete the host group using [Remove-AzHostGroup](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azhostgroup). 

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzHost -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name myHost
```

You can also delete the entire resource group in a single command using [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup). This will delete all resources created in the group, including all of the VMs, hosts and host groups.
 
```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName
```


## Next steps

- There is sample template, found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/201-vm-dedicated-hosts/README.md), that uses both zones and fault domains for maximum resiliency in a region.

- You can also deploy dedicated hosts using the [Azure portal](dedicated-hosts-portal.md).
