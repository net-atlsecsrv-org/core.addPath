# Preview: Deploy VMs to dedicated hosts using the Azure PowerShell

This article guides you through how to create an Azure [dedicated host](dedicated-hosts.md) to host your virtual machines (VMs). 

Make sure that you have installed Azure PowerShell version 2.4.2 or later, and you are signed in to an Azure account in with `Connect-AzAccount`. To install version 2.4.2, open a PowerShell prompt and type:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.Compute -Repository PSGallery -RequiredVersion 2.4.2-preview -AllowPrerelease
```

You will need at least version 1.6.0 of the PowerShellGet module to enable preview module functionality in PowerShell. The latest versions of PowerShell Core have this automatically built in, but for older versions of PowerShell, you can run the following command to update to the latest version:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Repository PSGallery -Force
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Dedicated Hosts is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
>
> **Known preview limitations**
> - Virtual machine scale sets are not currently supported on dedicated hosts.
> - The preview initial release supports the following VM series: DSv3 and ESv3. 



## Create a host group

A **host group** is a resource that represents a collection of dedicated hosts. You create a host group in a region and an availability zone, and add hosts to it. When planning for high availability, there are additional options. You can use one or both of the following options with your dedicated hosts: 
- Span across multiple availability zones. In this case, you are required to have a host group in each of the zones you wish to use.
- Span across multiple fault domains which are mapped to physical racks. 
 
In either case, you are need to provide the fault domain count for your host group. If you do not want to span fault domains in your group, use a fault domain count of 1. 

You can also decide to use both availability zones and fault domains. This example creates a host group in zone 1, with 2 fault domains. 


```powershell
$rgName = "myDHResourceGroup"
$location = "East US"

New-AzResourceGroup -Location $location -Name $rgName
$hostGroup = New-AzHostGroup `
   -Location $location `
   -Name myHostGroup `
   -PlatformFaultDomain 2 `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Zone 1
```

## Create a host

Now let's create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you are required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series as well as the hardware generation for your dedicated host.  During the preview, we will support the following host SKU values: DSv3_Type1 and ESv3_Type1.


For more information about the host SKUs and pricing, see [Azure Dedicated Host pricing](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing).

If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you will be asked to specify the fault domain for your host. In this example, we set the fault domain for the host to 1.


```powershell
$dHost = New-AzHost `
   -HostGroupName $hostGroup.Name `
   -Location $location -Name myHost `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Sku DSv3-Type1 `
   -AutoReplaceOnFailure 1 `
   -PlatformFaultDomain 1
```

## Create a VM

Create a virtual machine on the dedicated host. 

If you specified an availability zone when creating your host group, you are required to use the same zone when creating the virtual machine. For this example, because our host group is in zone 1, we need to create the VM in zone 1.  


```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential
New-AzVM `
   -Credential $cred `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Location $location `
   -Name myVM `
   -HostId $dhost.Id `
   -Image Win2016Datacenter `
   -Zone 1 `
   -Size Standard_D4s_v3
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you create a virtual machine on a host which does not have enough resources, the virtual machine will be created in a FAILED state. 

## Check the status of the host

You can check the host health status and how many virtual machines you can still deploy to the host using [GetAzHost](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azhost) with the `-InstanceView` parameter.

```
Get-AzHost `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -Name myHost `
   -HostGroupName $hostGroup.Name `
   -InstanceView
```

The output will look similar to this:

```
ResourceGroupName      : myDHResourceGroup
PlatformFaultDomain    : 1
AutoReplaceOnFailure   : True

```

## Clean up

You are being charged for your dedicated hosts even when no virtual machines are deployed. You should delete any hosts you are currently not using to save costs.  

You can only delete a host when there are no any longer virtual machines using it. Delete the VMs using [Remove-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvm).

```powershell
Remove-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name myVM
```

After deleting the VMs, you can delete the host using [Remove-AzHost](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azhost).

```powershell
Remove-AzHost -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name myHost
```

Once you have deleted all of your hosts, you may delete the host group using [Remove-AzHostGroup](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azhostgroup). 

```powershell
Remove-AzHost -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name myHost
```

You can also delete the entire resource group in a single command using [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup). This will delete all resources created in the group, including all of the VMs, hosts and host groups.
 
```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName
```


## Next steps

- There is sample template, found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/201-vm-dedicated-hosts/README.md), that uses both zones and fault domains for maximum resiliency in a region.

- You can also deploy dedicated hosts using the [Azure portal](dedicated-hosts-portal.md).
