## Virtual machine uncached vs cached limits
 Virtual machines that are both premium storage enabled and premium storage caching enabled have two different storage bandwidth limits. Letâ€™s continue with looking at the Standard_D8s_v3 virtual machine as an example. Here is the documentation on the [Dsv3-series](../dv3-dsv3-series.md) and on it the Standard_D8s_v3:

Let's run a benchmarking test on this VM and disk combination that will do create IO activity and you can learn all about how to benchmark storage IO on Azure [here](disks-benchmarks.md). From the benchmarking tool, you can see that the VM and Disk combination is able to achieve 22,800 IOPS:
