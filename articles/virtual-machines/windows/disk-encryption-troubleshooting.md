# Azure Disk Encryption troubleshooting guide

This guide is for IT professionals, information security analysts, and cloud administrators whose organizations use Azure Disk Encryption. This article is to help with troubleshooting disk-encryption-related problems.

Before taking any of the steps below, first ensure that the VMs you are attempting to encrypt are among the [supported VM sizes and operating systems](disk-encryption-overview.md#supported-vms-and-operating-systems), and that you have met all the prerequisites:

- [Networking requirements](disk-encryption-overview.md#networking-requirements)
- [Group policy requirements](disk-encryption-overview.md#group-policy-requirements)
- [Encryption key storage requirements](disk-encryption-overview.md#encryption-key-storage-requirements)

## Troubleshooting Azure Disk Encryption behind a firewall

When connectivity is restricted by a firewall, proxy requirement, or network security group (NSG) settings, the ability of the extension to perform needed tasks might be disrupted. This disruption can result in status messages such as "Extension status not available on the VM." In expected scenarios, the encryption fails to finish. The sections that follow have some common firewall problems that you might investigate.

### Network security groups
Any network security group settings that are applied must still allow the endpoint to meet the documented network configuration [prerequisites](disk-encryption-overview.md#networking-requirements) for disk encryption.

### Azure Key Vault behind a firewall

When encryption is being enabled with [Azure AD credentials](disk-encryption-windows-aad.md#), the target VM must allow connectivity to both Azure Active Directory endpoints and Key Vault endpoints. Current Azure Active Directory authentication endpoints are maintained in sections 56 and 59 of the [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges) documentation. Key Vault instructions are provided in the documentation on how to [Access Azure Key Vault behind a firewall](../../key-vault/general/access-behind-firewall.md).

### Azure Instance Metadata Service 
The VM must be able to access the [Azure Instance Metadata service](../windows/instance-metadata-service.md) endpoint which uses a well-known non-routable IP address (`169.254.169.254`) that can be accessed only from within the VM.  Proxy configurations that alter local HTTP traffic to this address (for example, adding an X-Forwarded-For header) are not supported.

## Troubleshooting Windows Server 2016 Server Core

On Windows Server 2016 Server Core, the bdehdcfg component isn't available by default. This component is required by Azure Disk Encryption. It's used to split the system volume from OS volume, which is done only once for the life time of the VM. These binaries aren't required during later encryption operations.

To work around this issue, copy the following four files from a Windows Server 2016 Data Center VM to the same location on Server Core:

   ```
   \windows\system32\bdehdcfg.exe
   \windows\system32\bdehdcfglib.dll
   \windows\system32\en-US\bdehdcfglib.dll.mui
   \windows\system32\en-US\bdehdcfg.exe.mui
   ```

1. Enter the following command:

   ```
   bdehdcfg.exe -target default
   ```

1. This command creates a 550-MB system partition. Reboot the system.

1. Use DiskPart to check the volumes, and then proceed.  

For example:

```
DISKPART> list vol

  Volume ###  Ltr  Label        Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info
  ----------  ---  -----------  -----  ----------  -------  ---------  --------
  Volume 0     C                NTFS   Partition    126 GB  Healthy    Boot
  Volume 1                      NTFS   Partition    550 MB  Healthy    System
  Volume 2     D   Temporary S  NTFS   Partition     13 GB  Healthy    Pagefile
```

## Troubleshooting encryption status 

The portal may display a disk as encrypted even after it has been unencrypted within the VM.  This can occur when low-level commands are used to directly unencrypt the disk from within the VM, instead of using the higher level Azure Disk Encryption management commands.  The higher level commands not only unencrypt the disk from within the VM, but outside of the VM they also update important platform level encryption settings and extension settings associated with the VM.  If these are not kept in alignment, the platform will not be able to report encryption status or provision the VM properly.

To disable Azure Disk Encryption with PowerShell, use [Disable-AzVMDiskEncryption](/powershell/module/az.compute/disable-azvmdiskencryption) followed by [Remove-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvmdiskencryptionextension). Running Remove-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension before the encryption is disabled will fail.

To disable Azure Disk Encryption with CLI, use [az vm encryption disable](/cli/azure/vm/encryption).
