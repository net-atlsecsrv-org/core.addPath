## AsmMetadataParser
This is a collection of helper tools created as part of enterprise migrations from Azure Service Management to Azure Resource Manager. This tool allows you to replicate your infrastructure into another subscription which can be used for testing migration and iron out any issues before running the migration on your Production subscription.

## migAz
migAz is an additional option to migrate a complete set of classic IaaS resources to Azure Resource Manager IaaS resources. The migration can occur within the same subscription or between different subscriptions and subscription types (ex: CSP subscriptions).
