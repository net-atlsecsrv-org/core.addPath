# Create and manage a Windows virtual machine that has multiple NICs
Virtual machines (VMs) in Azure can have multiple virtual network interface cards (NICs) attached to them. A common scenario is to have different subnets for front-end and back-end connectivity. You can associate multiple NICs on a VM to multiple subnets, but those subnets must all reside in the same virtual network (vNet). This article details how to create a VM that has multiple NICs attached to it. You also learn how to add or remove NICs from an existing VM. Different [VM sizes](sizes.md) support a varying number of NICs, so size your VM accordingly.

## Prerequisites

In the following examples, replace example parameter names with your own values. Example parameter names include *myResourceGroup*, *myVnet*, and *myVM*.

 

## Create a VM with multiple NICs
First, create a resource group. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *EastUs* location:

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
```

### Create virtual network and subnets
A common scenario is for a virtual network to have two or more subnets. One subnet may be for front-end traffic, the other for back-end traffic. To connect to both subnets, you then use multiple NICs on your VM.

1. Define two virtual network subnets with [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig). The following example defines the subnets for *mySubnetFrontEnd* and *mySubnetBackEnd*:

    ```powershell
    $mySubnetFrontEnd = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "mySubnetFrontEnd" `
        -AddressPrefix "192.168.1.0/24"
    $mySubnetBackEnd = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "mySubnetBackEnd" `
        -AddressPrefix "192.168.2.0/24"
    ```

2. Create your virtual network and subnets with [New-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork). The following example creates a virtual network named *myVnet*:

    ```powershell
    $myVnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
        -Location "EastUs" `
        -Name "myVnet" `
        -AddressPrefix "192.168.0.0/16" `
        -Subnet $mySubnetFrontEnd,$mySubnetBackEnd
    ```


### Create multiple NICs
Create two NICs with [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface). Attach one NIC to the front-end subnet and one NIC to the back-end subnet. The following example creates NICs named *myNic1* and *myNic2*:

```powershell
$frontEnd = $myVnet.Subnets|?{$_.Name -eq 'mySubnetFrontEnd'}
$myNic1 = New-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myNic1" `
    -Location "EastUs" `
    -SubnetId $frontEnd.Id

$backEnd = $myVnet.Subnets|?{$_.Name -eq 'mySubnetBackEnd'}
$myNic2 = New-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myNic2" `
    -Location "EastUs" `
    -SubnetId $backEnd.Id
```

Typically you also create a [network security group](../../virtual-network/security-overview.md) to filter network traffic to the VM and a [load balancer](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md) to distribute traffic across multiple VMs.

### Create the virtual machine
Now start to build your VM configuration. Each VM size has a limit for the total number of NICs that you can add to a VM. For more information, see [Windows VM sizes](sizes.md).

1. Set your VM credentials to the `$cred` variable as follows:

    ```powershell
    $cred = Get-Credential
    ```

2. Define your VM with [New-AzVMConfig](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig). The following example defines a VM named *myVM* and uses a VM size that supports more than two NICs (*Standard_DS3_v2*):

    ```powershell
    $vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName "myVM" -VMSize "Standard_DS3_v2"
    ```

3. Create the rest of your VM configuration with [Set-AzVMOperatingSystem](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmoperatingsystem) and [Set-AzVMSourceImage](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmsourceimage). The following example creates a Windows Server 2016 VM:

    ```powershell
    $vmConfig = Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $vmConfig `
        -Windows `
        -ComputerName "myVM" `
        -Credential $cred `
        -ProvisionVMAgent `
        -EnableAutoUpdate
    $vmConfig = Set-AzVMSourceImage -VM $vmConfig `
        -PublisherName "MicrosoftWindowsServer" `
        -Offer "WindowsServer" `
        -Skus "2016-Datacenter" `
        -Version "latest"
   ```

4. Attach the two NICs that you previously created with [Add-AzVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmnetworkinterface):

    ```powershell
    $vmConfig = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vmConfig -Id $myNic1.Id -Primary
    $vmConfig = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vmConfig -Id $myNic2.Id
    ```

5. Create your VM with [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm):

    ```powershell
    New-AzVM -VM $vmConfig -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUs"
    ```

6. Add routes for secondary NICs to the OS by completing the steps in [Configure the operating system for multiple NICs](#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

## Add a NIC to an existing VM
To add a virtual NIC to an existing VM, you deallocate the VM, add the virtual NIC, then start the VM. Different [VM sizes](sizes.md) support a varying number of NICs, so size your VM accordingly. If needed, you can [resize a VM](resize-vm.md).

1. Deallocate the VM with [Stop-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/stop-azvm). The following example deallocates the VM named *myVM* in *myResourceGroup*:

    ```powershell
    Stop-AzVM -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```

2. Get the existing configuration of the VM with [Get-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm). The following example gets information for the VM named *myVM* in *myResourceGroup*:

    ```powershell
    $vm = Get-AzVm -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```

3. The following example creates a virtual NIC with [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface) named *myNic3* that is attached to *mySubnetBackEnd*. The virtual NIC is then attached to the VM named *myVM* in *myResourceGroup* with [Add-AzVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmnetworkinterface):

    ```powershell
    # Get info for the back end subnet
    $myVnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name "myVnet" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    $backEnd = $myVnet.Subnets|?{$_.Name -eq 'mySubnetBackEnd'}

    # Create a virtual NIC
    $myNic3 = New-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
        -Name "myNic3" `
        -Location "EastUs" `
        -SubnetId $backEnd.Id

    # Get the ID of the new virtual NIC and add to VM
    $nicId = (Get-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "MyNic3").Id
    Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nicId | Update-AzVm -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```

    ### Primary virtual NICs
    One of the NICs on a multi-NIC VM needs to be primary. If one of the existing virtual NICs on the VM is already set as primary, you can skip this step. The following example assumes that two virtual NICs are now present on a VM and you wish to add the first NIC (`[0]`) as the primary:
        
    ```powershell
    # List existing NICs on the VM and find which one is primary
    $vm.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces
    
    # Set NIC 0 to be primary
    $vm.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces[0].Primary = $true
    $vm.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces[1].Primary = $false
    
    # Update the VM state in Azure
    Update-AzVM -VM $vm -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```

4. Start the VM with [Start-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/start-azvm):

    ```powershell
    Start-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
    ```

5. Add routes for secondary NICs to the OS by completing the steps in [Configure the operating system for multiple NICs](#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

## Remove a NIC from an existing VM
To remove a virtual NIC from an existing VM, you deallocate the VM, remove the virtual NIC, then start the VM.

1. Deallocate the VM with [Stop-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/stop-azvm). The following example deallocates the VM named *myVM* in *myResourceGroup*:

    ```powershell
    Stop-AzVM -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```

2. Get the existing configuration of the VM with [Get-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm). The following example gets information for the VM named *myVM* in *myResourceGroup*:

    ```powershell
    $vm = Get-AzVm -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```

3. Get information about the NIC remove with [Get-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworkinterface). The following example gets information about *myNic3*:

    ```powershell
    # List existing NICs on the VM if you need to determine NIC name
    $vm.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces

    $nicId = (Get-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myNic3").Id   
    ```

4. Remove the NIC with [Remove-AzVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvmnetworkinterface) and then update the VM with [Update-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvm). The following example removes *myNic3* as obtained by `$nicId` in the preceding step:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -NetworkInterfaceIDs $nicId | `
        Update-AzVm -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```   

5. Start the VM with [Start-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/start-azvm):

    ```powershell
    Start-AzVM -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
    ```   

## Create multiple NICs with templates
Azure Resource Manager templates provide a way to create multiple instances of a resource during deployment, such as creating multiple NICs. Resource Manager templates use declarative JSON files to define your environment. For more information, see [overview of Azure Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md). You can use *copy* to specify the number of instances to create:

```json
"copy": {
    "name": "multiplenics",
    "count": "[parameters('count')]"
}
```

For more information, see [creating multiple instances by using *copy*](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/copy-resources.md). 

You can also use `copyIndex()` to append a number to a resource name. You can then create *myNic1*, *MyNic2* and so on. The following code shows an example of appending the index value:

```json
"name": "[concat('myNic', copyIndex())]", 
```

You can read a complete example of [creating multiple NICs by using Resource Manager templates](../../virtual-network/template-samples.md).

Add routes for secondary NICs to the OS by completing the steps in [Configure the operating system for multiple NICs](#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

## Configure guest OS for multiple NICs

Azure assigns a default gateway to the first (primary) network interface attached to the virtual machine. Azure does not assign a default gateway to additional (secondary) network interfaces attached to a virtual machine. Therefore, you are unable to communicate with resources outside the subnet that a secondary network interface is in, by default. Secondary network interfaces can, however, communicate with resources outside their subnet, though the steps to enable communication are different for different operating systems.

1. From a Windows command prompt, run the `route print` command, which returns output similar to the following output for a virtual machine with two attached network interfaces:

    ```
    ===========================================================================
    Interface List
    3...00 0d 3a 10 92 ce ......Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #3
    7...00 0d 3a 10 9b 2a ......Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #4
    ===========================================================================
    ```
 
    In this example, **Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #4** (interface 7) is the secondary network interface that doesn't have a default gateway assigned to it.

2. From a command prompt, run the `ipconfig` command to see which IP address is assigned to the secondary network interface. In this example, 192.168.2.4 is assigned to interface 7. No default gateway address is returned for the secondary network interface.

3. To route all traffic destined for addresses outside the subnet of the secondary network interface to the gateway for the subnet, run the following command:

    ```
    route add -p 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 192.168.2.1 METRIC 5015 IF 7
    ```

    The gateway address for the subnet is the first IP address (ending in .1) in the address range defined for the subnet. If you don't want to route all traffic outside the subnet, you could add individual routes to specific destinations, instead. For example, if you only wanted to route traffic from the secondary network interface to the 192.168.3.0 network, you enter the command:

      ```
      route add -p 192.168.3.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1 METRIC 5015 IF 7
      ```
  
4. To confirm successful communication with a resource on the 192.168.3.0 network, for example, enter the following command to ping 192.168.3.4 using interface 7 (192.168.2.4):

    ```
    ping 192.168.3.4 -S 192.168.2.4
    ```

    You may need to open ICMP through the Windows firewall of the device you're pinging with the following command:
  
      ```
      netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=Allow-ping protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow
      ```
  
5. To confirm the added route is in the route table, enter the `route print` command, which returns output similar to the following text:

    ```
    ===========================================================================
    Active Routes:
    Network Destination        Netmask          Gateway       Interface  Metric
              0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0      192.168.1.1      192.168.1.4     15
              0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0      192.168.2.1      192.168.2.4   5015
    ```

    The route listed with *192.168.1.1* under **Gateway**, is the route that is there by default for the primary network interface. The route with *192.168.2.1* under **Gateway**, is the route you added.

## Next steps
Review [Windows VM sizes](sizes.md) when you're trying to create a VM that has multiple NICs. Pay attention to the maximum number of NICs that each VM size supports.
