# Quickstart: Create a Windows virtual machine with the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure CLI to deploy a virtual machine (VM) in Azure that runs Windows Server 2016. To see your VM in action, you then RDP to the VM and install the IIS web server.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.30 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create virtual machine

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm). The following example creates a VM named *myVM*. This example uses *azureuser* for an administrative user name and *myPassword12* as the password. Update these values to something appropriate to your environment. These values are needed when you connect to the VM.

```azurecli-interactive
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image win2016datacenter \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --admin-password myPassword12
```

It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources. The following example output shows the VM create operation was successful.

```azurecli-interactive
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "52.174.34.95",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}
```

Note your own `publicIpAddress` in the output from your VM. This address is used to access the VM in the next steps.

## Open port 80 for web traffic

By default, only RDP connections are opened when you create a Windows VM in Azure. Use [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm) to open TCP port 80 for use with the IIS web server:

```azurecli-interactive
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

## Connect to virtual machine

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session from your local computer. Replace the IP address with the public IP address of your VM. When prompted, enter the credentials used when the VM was created:

```powershell
mstsc /v:publicIpAddress
```

## Install web server

To see your VM in action, install the IIS web server. Open a PowerShell prompt on the VM and run the following command:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
```

When done, close the RDP connection to the VM.

## View the web server in action

With IIS installed and port 80 now open on your VM from the Internet, use a web browser of your choice to view the default IIS welcome page. Use the public IP address of your VM obtained in a previous step. The following example shows the default IIS web site:

![IIS default site](./media/quick-create-powershell/default-iis-website.png)

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple virtual machine, open a network port for web traffic, and installed a basic web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Windows VMs.
