# Upload a generalized VHD to Azure to create a new VM

This topic covers uploading a generalized unmanaged disk to a storage account and then creating a new VM using the uploaded disk. A generalized VHD image has had all of your personal account information removed using Sysprep. 

If you want to create a VM from a specialized VHD in a storage account, see [Create a VM from a specialized VHD](sa-create-vm-specialized.md).

This topic covers using storage accounts, but we recommend customers move to using Managed Disks instead. For a complete walk-through of how to prepare, upload and create a new VM using managed disks, see [Create a new VM from a generalized VHD uploaded to Azure using Managed Disks](upload-generalized-managed.md).

 

## Prepare the VM

A generalized VHD has had all of your personal account information removed using Sysprep. If you intend to use the VHD as an image to create new VMs from, you should:
  
  * [Prepare a Windows VHD to upload to Azure](prepare-for-upload-vhd-image.md). 
  * Generalize the virtual machine using Sysprep

### Generalize a Windows virtual machine using Sysprep
This section shows you how to generalize your Windows virtual machine for use as an image. Sysprep removes all your personal account information, among other things, and prepares the machine to be used as an image. For details about Sysprep, see [How to Use Sysprep: An Introduction](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb457073.aspx).

Make sure the server roles running on the machine are supported by Sysprep. For more information, see [Sysprep Support for Server Roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/sysprep-support-for-server-roles)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are running Sysprep before uploading your VHD to Azure for the first time, make sure you have [prepared your VM](prepare-for-upload-vhd-image.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) before running Sysprep. 
> 
> 

1. Sign in to the Windows virtual machine.
2. Open the Command Prompt window as an administrator. Change the directory to **%windir%\system32\sysprep**, and then run `sysprep.exe`.
3. In the **System Preparation Tool** dialog box, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**, and make sure that the **Generalize** check box is selected.
4. In **Shutdown Options**, select **Shutdown**.
5. Click **OK**.
   
    ![Start Sysprep](./media/upload-generalized-managed/sysprepgeneral.png)
6. When Sysprep completes, it shuts down the virtual machine. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not restart the VM until you are done uploading the VHD to Azure or creating an image from the VM. If the VM accidentally gets restarted, run Sysprep to generalize it again.
>

## Upload the VHD

Upload the VHD to an Azure storage account.

### Log in to Azure
If you don't already have PowerShell version 1.4 or above installed, read [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview).

1. Open Azure PowerShell and sign in to your Azure account. A pop-up window opens for you to enter your Azure account credentials.
   
    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```
2. Get the subscription IDs for your available subscriptions.
   
    ```powershell
    Get-AzSubscription
    ```
3. Set the correct subscription using the subscription ID. Replace `<subscriptionID>` with the ID of the correct subscription.
   
    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscriptionID>"
    ```

### Get the storage account
You need a storage account in Azure to store the uploaded VM image. You can either use an existing storage account or create a new one. 

To show the available storage accounts, type:

```powershell
Get-AzStorageAccount
```

If you want to use an existing storage account, proceed to the Upload the VM image section.

If you need to create a storage account, follow these steps:

1. You need the name of the resource group where the storage account should be created. To find out all the resource groups that are in your subscription, type:
   
    ```powershell
    Get-AzResourceGroup
    ```

    To create a resource group named **myResourceGroup** in the **West US** region, type:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location "West US"
    ```

2. Create a storage account named **mystorageaccount** in this resource group by using the [New-AzStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstorageaccount) cmdlet:
   
    ```powershell
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name mystorageaccount -Location "West US" `
        -SkuName "Standard_LRS" -Kind "Storage"
    ```
 
### Start the upload 

Use the [Add-AzVhd](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvhd) cmdlet to upload the image to a container in your storage account. This example uploads the file **myVHD.vhd** from `"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\"` to a storage account named **mystorageaccount** in the **myResourceGroup** resource group. The file will be placed into the container named **mycontainer** and the new file name will be **myUploadedVHD.vhd**.

```powershell
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$urlOfUploadedImageVhd = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myUploadedVHD.vhd"
Add-AzVhd -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Destination $urlOfUploadedImageVhd `
    -LocalFilePath "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\myVHD.vhd"
```


If successful, you get a response that looks similar to this:

```powershell
MD5 hash is being calculated for the file C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\myVHD.vhd.
MD5 hash calculation is completed.
Elapsed time for the operation: 00:03:35
Creating new page blob of size 53687091712...
Elapsed time for upload: 01:12:49

LocalFilePath           DestinationUri
-------------           --------------
C:\Users\Public\Doc...  https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myUploadedVHD.vhd
```

Depending on your network connection and the size of your VHD file, this command may take a while to complete.


## Create a new VM 

You can now use the uploaded VHD to create a new VM. 

### Set the URI of the VHD

The URI for the VHD to use is in the format: https://**mystorageaccount**.blob.core.windows.net/**mycontainer**/**MyVhdName**.vhd. In this example the VHD named **myVHD** is in the storage account **mystorageaccount** in the container **mycontainer**.

```powershell
$imageURI = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myVhd.vhd"
```


### Create a virtual network
Create the vNet and subnet of the [virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

1. Create the subnet. The following sample creates a subnet named **mySubnet** in the resource group **myResourceGroup** with the address prefix of **10.0.0.0/24**.  
   
    ```powershell
    $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
    $subnetName = "mySubnet"
    $singleSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
    ```
2. Create the virtual network. The following sample creates a virtual network named **myVnet** in the **West US** location with the address prefix of **10.0.0.0/16**.  
   
    ```powershell
    $location = "WestUS"
    $vnetName = "myVnet"
    $vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $singleSubnet
    ```    

### Create a public IP address and network interface
To enable communication with the virtual machine in the virtual network, you need a [public IP address](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md) and a network interface.

1. Create a public IP address. This example creates a public IP address named **myPip**. 
   
    ```powershell
    $ipName = "myPip"
    $pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $ipName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AllocationMethod Dynamic
    ```       
2. Create the NIC. This example creates a NIC named **myNic**. 
   
    ```powershell
    $nicName = "myNic"
    $nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name $nicName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id
    ```

### Create the network security group and an RDP rule
To be able to log in to your VM using RDP, you need to have a security rule that allows RDP access on port 3389. 

This example creates an NSG named **myNsg** that contains a rule called **myRdpRule** that allows RDP traffic over port 3389. For more information about NSGs, see [Opening ports to a VM in Azure using PowerShell](nsg-quickstart-powershell.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).

```powershell
$nsgName = "myNsg"

$rdpRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myRdpRule -Description "Allow RDP" `
    -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 110 `
    -SourceAddressPrefix Internet -SourcePortRange * `
    -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange 3389

$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
    -Name $nsgName -SecurityRules $rdpRule
```


### Create a variable for the virtual network
Create a variable for the completed virtual network. 

```powershell
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vnetName
```

### Create the VM
The following PowerShell script shows how to set up the virtual machine configurations and use the uploaded VM image as the source for the new installation.



```powershell
# Enter a new user name and password to use as the local administrator account 
    # for remotely accessing the VM.
    $cred = Get-Credential

    # Name of the storage account where the VHD is located. This example sets the 
    # storage account name as "myStorageAccount"
    $storageAccName = "myStorageAccount"

    # Name of the virtual machine. This example sets the VM name as "myVM".
    $vmName = "myVM"

    # Size of the virtual machine. This example creates "Standard_D2_v2" sized VM. 
    # See the VM sizes documentation for more information: 
    # https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/
    $vmSize = "Standard_D2_v2"

    # Computer name for the VM. This examples sets the computer name as "myComputer".
    $computerName = "myComputer"

    # Name of the disk that holds the OS. This example sets the 
    # OS disk name as "myOsDisk"
    $osDiskName = "myOsDisk"

    # Assign a SKU name. This example sets the SKU name as "Standard_LRS"
    # Valid values for -SkuName are: Standard_LRS - locally redundant storage, Standard_ZRS - zone redundant
    # storage, Standard_GRS - geo redundant storage, Standard_RAGRS - read access geo redundant storage,
    # Premium_LRS - premium locally redundant storage. 
    $skuName = "Standard_LRS"

    # Get the storage account where the uploaded image is stored
    $storageAcc = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $rgName -AccountName $storageAccName

    # Set the VM name and size
    $vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize $vmSize

    #Set the Windows operating system configuration and add the NIC
    $vm = Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $vmConfig -Windows -ComputerName $computerName `
        -Credential $cred -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate
    $vm = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id

    # Create the OS disk URI
    $osDiskUri = '{0}vhds/{1}-{2}.vhd' `
        -f $storageAcc.PrimaryEndpoints.Blob.ToString(), $vmName.ToLower(), $osDiskName

    # Configure the OS disk to be created from the existing VHD image (-CreateOption fromImage).
    $vm = Set-AzVMOSDisk -VM $vm -Name $osDiskName -VhdUri $osDiskUri `
        -CreateOption fromImage -SourceImageUri $imageURI -Windows

    # Create the new VM
    New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location -VM $vm
```

## Verify that the VM was created
When complete, you should see the newly created VM in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **Browse** > **Virtual machines**, or by using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
    $vmList = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName
    $vmList.Name
```
