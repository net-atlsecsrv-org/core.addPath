# Time sync for Windows VMs in Azure

Time sync is important for security and event correlation. Sometimes it is used for distributed transactions implementation. Time accuracy between multiple computer systems is achieved through synchronization. Synchronization can be affected by multiple things, including reboots and network traffic between the time source and the computer fetching the time. 

Azure is now backed by infrastructure running Windows Server 2016. Windows Server 2016 has improved algorithms used to correct time and condition the local clock to synchronize with UTC.  Windows Server 2016 also improved the VMICTimeSync service that governs how VMs sync with the host for accurate time. Improvements include more accurate initial time on VM start or VM restore and interrupt latency correction for samples provided to Windows Time (W32time).

## Overview

Accuracy for a computer clock is gauged on how close the computer clock is to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time standard. UTC is defined by a multinational sample of precise atomic clocks that can only be off by one second in 300 years. But, reading UTC directly requires specialized hardware. Instead, time servers are synced to UTC and are accessed from other computers to provide scalability and robustness. Every computer has time synchronization service running that knows what time servers to use and periodically checks if computer clock needs to be corrected and adjusts time if needed. 

Azure hosts are synchronized to internal Microsoft time servers that take their time from Microsoft-owned Stratum 1 devices, with GPS antennas. Virtual machines in Azure can either depend on their host to pass the accurate time (*host time*) on to the VM or the VM can directly get time from a time server, or a combination of both. 

Virtual machine interactions with the host can also affect the clock. During [memory preserving maintenance](maintenance-and-updates.md#maintenance-that-doesnt-require-a-reboot), VMs are paused for up to 30 seconds. For example, before maintenance begins the VM clock shows 10:00:00 AM and lasts 28 seconds. After the VM resumes, the clock on the VM would still show 10:00:00 AM, which would be 28 seconds off. To correct for this, the VMICTimeSync service monitors what is happening on the host and prompts for changes to happen on the VMs to compensate.

The VMICTimeSync service operates in either sample or sync mode and will only influence the clock forward. In sample mode, which requires W32time to be running, the VMICTimeSync service polls the host every 5 seconds and provides time samples to W32time. Approximately every 30 seconds, the W32time service takes the latest time sample and uses it to influence the guest's clock. Sync mode activates if a guest has been resumed or if a guest's clock drifts more than 5 seconds behind the host's clock. In cases where the W32time service is properly running, the latter case should never happen.

Without time synchronization working, the clock on the VM would accumulate errors. When there is only one VM, the effect might not be significant unless the workload requires highly accurate timekeeping. But in most cases, we have multiple, interconnected VMs that use time to track transactions and the time needs to be consistent throughout the entire deployment. When time between VMs is different, you could see the following effects:

- Authentication will fail. Security protocols like Kerberos or certificate-dependent technology rely on time being consistent across the systems. 
- It's very hard to figure out what have happened in a system if logs (or other data) don't agree on time. The same event would look like it occurred at different times, making correlation difficult.
- If clock is off, the billing could be calculated incorrectly.

The best results for Windows deployments are achieved by using Windows Server 2016 as the guest operating system, which ensures you can use the latest improvements in time synchronization.

## Configuration options

There are three options for configuring time sync for your Windows VMs hosted in Azure:

- Host time and time.windows.com. This is the default configuration used in Azure Marketplace images.
- Host-only.
- Use another, external time server with or without using host time.


### Use the default

By default Windows OS VM images are configured for w32time to sync from two sources: 

- The NtpClient provider, which gets information from time.windows.com.
- The VMICTimeSync service, used to communicate the host time to the VMs and make corrections after the VM is paused for maintenance. Azure hosts use Microsoft-owned Stratum 1 devices to keep accurate time.

w32time would prefer the time provider in the following order of priority: stratum level, root delay, root dispersion, time offset. In most cases, w32time would prefer time.windows.com to the host because time.windows.com reports lower stratum. 

For domain joined machines the domain itself establishes time sync hierarchy, but the forest root still needs to take time from somewhere and the following considerations would still hold true.


### Host-only 

Because time.windows.com is a public NTP server, syncing time with it requires sending traffic over the internet, varying packet delays can negatively affect quality of the time sync. Removing time.windows.com by switching to host-only sync can sometimes improve your time sync results.

Switching to host-only time sync makes sense if you experience time sync issues using the default configuration. Try out the host-only sync to see if that would improve the time sync on VM. 

### External time server

If you have specific time sync requirements, there is also an option of using external time servers. External time servers can provide specific time, which can be useful for test scenarios, ensuring time uniformity with machines hosted in non-Microsoft datacenters, or handling leap seconds in a special way.

You can combine external servers with the VMICTimeSync service and VMICTimeProvider to provide results similar to the default configuration. 

## Check your configuration


Check if the NtpClient time provider is configured to use explicit NTP servers (NTP) or domain time sync (NT5DS).

```
w32tm /dumpreg /subkey:Parameters | findstr /i "type"
```

If the VM is using NTP, you will see the following output:

```
Value Name                 Value Type          Value Data
Type                       REG_SZ              NTP
```

To see what time server the NtpClient time provider is using, at an elevated command prompt type:

```
w32tm /dumpreg /subkey:Parameters | findstr /i "ntpserver"
```

If the VM is using the default, the output will look like this:

```
NtpServer                  REG_SZ              time.windows.com,0x8
```


To see what time provider is being used currently.

```
w32tm /query /source
```


Here is the output you could see and what it would mean:
	
- **time.windows.com** - in the default configuration, w32time would get time from time.windows.com. The time sync quality depends on internet connectivity to it and is affected by packet delays. This is the usual output from the default setup.
- **VM IC Time Synchronization Provider**  - the VM is syncing time from the host. This usually is the result if you opt-in for host-only time sync or the NtpServer is not available at the moment. 
- *Your domain server* - the current machine is in a domain and the domain defines the time sync hierarchy.
- *Some other server* - w32time was explicitly configured to get the time from that another server. Time sync quality depends on this time server quality.
- **Local CMOS Clock** - clock is unsynchronized. You can get this output if w32time hasn't had enough time to start after a reboot or when all the configured time sources are not available.


## Opt-in for host-only time sync

Azure is constantly working on improving time sync on hosts and can guarantee that all the time sync infrastructure is collocated in Microsoft-owned datacenters. If you have time sync issues with the default setup that prefers to use time.windows.com as the primary time source, you can use the following commands to opt-in to host-only time sync.

Mark the VMIC provider as enabled. 

```
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\TimeProviders\VMICTimeProvider /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

Mark the NTPClient provider as disabled.

```
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\TimeProviders\NtpClient /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

Restart the w32time Service.

```
net stop w32time && net start w32time
```


## Windows Server 2012 and R2 VMs 

Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 have different default settings for time sync. The w32time by default is configured in a way that prefers low overhead of the service over to precise time. 

If you want to move your Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 deployments to use the newer defaults that prefer precise time, you can apply the following settings.

Update the w32time poll and update intervals to match Windows Server 2016 settings.

```
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\Config /v MinPollInterval /t REG_DWORD /d 6 /f
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\Config /v MaxPollInterval /t REG_DWORD /d 10 /f
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\Config /v UpdateInterval /t REG_DWORD /d 100 /f
w32tm /config /update
```

For w32time to be able to use the new poll intervals, the NtpServers be marked as using them. If servers are annotated with 0x1 bitflag mask, that would override this mechanism and w32time would use SpecialPollInterval instead. Make sure that specified NTP servers are either using 0x8 flag or no flag at all:

Check what flags are being used for the used NTP servers.

```
w32tm /dumpreg /subkey:Parameters | findstr /i "ntpserver"
```
