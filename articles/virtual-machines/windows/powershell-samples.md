| [Create a fully configured virtual machine](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-vm.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) | Creates a resource group, a virtual machine, and all related resources.|
| [Create highly available virtual machines](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-nlb-vm.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) | Creates several virtual machines in a highly-available and load-balanced configuration.|
| [Create a VM and run a configuration script](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-vm-iis.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) | Creates a virtual machine and uses the Azure Custom Script extension to install IIS. |
| [Create a VM and run a DSC configuration](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-iis-using-dsc.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) | Creates a virtual machine and uses the Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension to install IIS. |
| [Upload a VHD and create VMs](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-upload-generalized-script.md) | Uploads a local VHD file to Azure, creates an image from the VHD, and then creates a VM from that image. |
| [Create a VM from a managed OS disk](./../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-vm-from-managed-os-disks.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) | Creates a virtual machine by attaching an existing Managed Disk as OS disk. |

|**Manage storage**||
| [Create a managed disk from a VHD in the same or a different subscription](../scripts/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-sample-create-managed-disk-from-vhd.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) | Creates a managed disk from a specialized VHD as an OS disk, or from a data VHD as a data disk, in the same or a different subscription.  |
