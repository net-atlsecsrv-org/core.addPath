# Create a VM from a specialized VHD in a storage account

Create a new VM by attaching a specialized unmanaged disk as the OS disk using Powershell. A specialized disk is a copy of VHD from an existing VM that maintains the user accounts, applications and other state data from your original VM. 

You have two options:
* [Upload a VHD](sa-create-vm-specialized.md#option-1-upload-a-specialized-vhd)
* [Copy the VHD of an existing Azure VM](sa-create-vm-specialized.md#option-2-copy-the-vhd-from-an-existing-azure-vm)

 


## Option 1: Upload a specialized VHD

You can upload the VHD from a specialized VM created with an on-premises virtualization tool, like Hyper-V, or a VM exported from another cloud.

### Prepare the VM
You can upload a specialized VHD that was created using an on-premises VM or a VHD exported from another cloud. A specialized VHD maintains the user accounts, applications and other state data from your original VM. If you intend to use the VHD as-is to create a new VM, ensure the following steps are completed. 
  
  * [Prepare a Windows VHD to upload to Azure](prepare-for-upload-vhd-image.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json). **Do not** generalize the VM using Sysprep.
  * Remove any guest virtualization tools and agents that are installed on the VM (i.e. VMware tools).
  * Ensure the VM is configured to pull its IP address and DNS settings via DHCP. This ensures that the server obtains an IP address within the VNet when it starts up. 


### Get the storage account
You need a storage account in Azure to store the uploaded VM image. You can either use an existing storage account or create a new one. 

To show the available storage accounts, type:

```powershell
Get-AzStorageAccount
```

If you want to use an existing storage account, proceed to the Upload the VM image section.

If you need to create a storage account, follow these steps:

1. You need the name of the resource group where the storage account should be created. To find out all the resource groups that are in your subscription, type:
   
    ```powershell
    Get-AzResourceGroup
    ```

    To create a resource group named **myResourceGroup** in the **West US** region, type:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location "West US"
    ```

2. Create a storage account named **mystorageaccount** in this resource group by using the [New-AzStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstorageaccount) cmdlet:
   
    ```powershell
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name mystorageaccount -Location "West US" `
        -SkuName "Standard_LRS" -Kind "Storage"
    ```
   
### Upload the VHD to your storage account
Use the [Add-AzVhd](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvhd) cmdlet to upload the image to a container in your storage account. This example uploads the file **myVHD.vhd** from `"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\"` to a storage account named **mystorageaccount** in the **myResourceGroup** resource group. The file will be placed into the container named **mycontainer** and the new file name will be **myUploadedVHD.vhd**.

```powershell
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$urlOfUploadedImageVhd = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myUploadedVHD.vhd"
Add-AzVhd -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Destination $urlOfUploadedImageVhd `
    -LocalFilePath "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\myVHD.vhd"
```


If successful, you get a response that looks similar to this:

```powershell
MD5 hash is being calculated for the file C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\myVHD.vhd.
MD5 hash calculation is completed.
Elapsed time for the operation: 00:03:35
Creating new page blob of size 53687091712...
Elapsed time for upload: 01:12:49

LocalFilePath           DestinationUri
-------------           --------------
C:\Users\Public\Doc...  https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myUploadedVHD.vhd
```

Depending on your network connection and the size of your VHD file, this command may take a while to complete.


## Option 2: Copy the VHD from an existing Azure VM

You can copy a VHD to another storage account to use when creating a new, duplicate VM.

### Before you begin
Make sure that you:

* Have information about the **source and destination storage accounts**. For the source VM, you need to have the storage account and container names. Usually, the container name will be **vhds**. You also need to have a destination storage account. If you don't already have one, you can create one using either the portal (**All Services** > Storage accounts > Add) or using the [New-AzStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstorageaccount) cmdlet. 
* Have downloaded and installed the [AzCopy tool](../../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy.md). 

### Deallocate the VM
Deallocate the VM, which frees up the VHD to be copied. 

* **Portal**: Click **Virtual machines** > **myVM** > Stop
* **Powershell**: Use [Stop-AzVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/stop-azvm) to stop (deallocate) the VM named **myVM** in resource group **myResourceGroup**.

```powershell
Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVM
```

The **Status** for the VM in the Azure portal changes from **Stopped** to **Stopped (deallocated)**.

### Get the storage account URLs
You need the URLs of the source and destination storage accounts. The URLs look like: `https://<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<containerName>/`. If you already know the storage account and container name, you can just replace the information between the brackets to create your URL. 

You can use the Azure portal or Azure Powershell to get the URL:

* **Portal**: Click the **>** for **All services** > **Storage accounts** > *storage account* > **Blobs** and your source VHD file is probably in the **vhds** container. Click **Properties** for the container, and copy the text labeled **URL**. You'll need the URLs of both the source and destination containers. 
* **Powershell**: Use [Get-AzVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm) to get the information for VM named **myVM** in the resource group **myResourceGroup**. In the results, look in the **Storage profile** section for the **Vhd Uri**. The first part of the Uri is the URL to the container and the last part is the OS VHD name for the VM.

```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
``` 

## Get the storage access keys
Find the access keys for the source and destination storage accounts. For more information about access keys, see [About Azure storage accounts](../../storage/common/storage-create-storage-account.md).

* **Portal**: Click **All services** > **Storage accounts** > *storage account* > **Access keys**. Copy the key labeled as **key1**.
* **Powershell**: Use [Get-AzStorageAccountKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccountkey) to get the storage key for the storage account **mystorageaccount** in the resource group **myResourceGroup**. Copy the key labeled **key1**.

```powershell
Get-AzStorageAccountKey -Name mystorageaccount -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
```

### Copy the VHD
You can copy files between storage accounts using AzCopy. For the destination container, if the specified container doesn't exist, it will be created for you. 

To use AzCopy, open a command prompt on your local machine and navigate to the folder where AzCopy is installed. It will be similar to *C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy*. 

To copy all of the files within a container, you use the **/S** switch. This can be used to copy the OS VHD and all of the data disks if they are in the same container. This example shows how to copy all of the files in the container **mysourcecontainer** in storage account **mysourcestorageaccount** to the container **mydestinationcontainer** in the **mydestinationstorageaccount** storage account. Replace the names of the storage accounts and containers with your own. Replace `<sourceStorageAccountKey1>` and `<destinationStorageAccountKey1>` with your own keys.

```
AzCopy /Source:https://mysourcestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mysourcecontainer `
    /Dest:https://mydestinationatorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mydestinationcontainer `
    /SourceKey:<sourceStorageAccountKey1> /DestKey:<destinationStorageAccountKey1> /S
```

If you only want to copy a specific VHD in a container with multiple files, you can also specify the file name using the /Pattern switch. In this example, only the file named **myFileName.vhd** will be copied.

```
AzCopy /Source:https://mysourcestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mysourcecontainer `
  /Dest:https://mydestinationatorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mydestinationcontainer `
  /SourceKey:<sourceStorageAccountKey1> /DestKey:<destinationStorageAccountKey1> `
  /Pattern:myFileName.vhd
```


When it is finished, you will get a message that looks something like:

```
Finished 2 of total 2 file(s).
[2016/10/07 17:37:41] Transfer summary:
-----------------
Total files transferred: 2
Transfer successfully:   2
Transfer skipped:        0
Transfer failed:         0
Elapsed time:            00.00:13:07
```

### Troubleshooting
* When you use AZCopy, if you see the error "Server failed to authenticate the request", make sure the value of the Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature. If you are using Key 2 or the secondary storage key, try using the primary or 1st storage key.

## Create the new VM 

You need to create networking and other VM resources to be used by the new VM.

### Create the subNet and vNet

Create the vNet and subNet of the [virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

1. Create the subNet. This example creates a subnet named **mySubNet**, in the resource group **myResourceGroup**, and sets the subnet address prefix to **10.0.0.0/24**.
   
    ```powershell
    $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
    $subnetName = "mySubNet"
    $singleSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
    ```
2. Create the vNet. This example sets the virtual network name to be **myVnetName**, the location to **West US**, and the address prefix for the virtual network to **10.0.0.0/16**. 
   
    ```powershell
    $location = "West US"
    $vnetName = "myVnetName"
    $vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $singleSubnet
    ```    
   ### Create the network security group and an RDP rule
   To be able to log in to your VM using RDP, you need to have an security rule that allows RDP access on port 3389. Because the VHD for the new VM was created from an existing specialized VM, after the VM is created you can use an existing account from the source virtual machine that had permission to log on using RDP.
   This needs to be completed prior to creating the network interface it will be associated with.  
   This example sets the NSG name to **myNsg** and the RDP rule name to **myRdpRule**.

```powershell
$nsgName = "myNsg"

$rdpRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myRdpRule -Description "Allow RDP" `
    -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 110 `
    -SourceAddressPrefix Internet -SourcePortRange * `
    -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange 3389
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
    -Name $nsgName -SecurityRules $rdpRule
	
```

For more information about endpoints and NSG rules, see [Opening ports to a VM in Azure using PowerShell](nsg-quickstart-powershell.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).

### Create a public IP address and NIC
To enable communication with the virtual machine in the virtual network, you need a [public IP address](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md) and a network interface.

1. Create the public IP. In this example, the public IP address name is set to **myIP**.
   
    ```powershell
    $ipName = "myIP"
    $pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $ipName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AllocationMethod Dynamic
    ```       
2. Create the NIC. In this example, the NIC name is set to **myNicName**. This step also associates the Network Security Group created earlier with this NIC.
   
    ```powershell
    $nicName = "myNicName"
    $nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name $nicName -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
	-Location $location -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id -NetworkSecurityGroupId $nsg.Id
    ```

### Set the VM name and size

This example sets the VM name to "myVM" and the VM size to "Standard_A2".
```powershell
$vmName = "myVM"
$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize "Standard_A2"
```

### Add the NIC
	
```powershell
$vm = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vmConfig -Id $nic.Id
```
	
	
### Configure the OS disk

1. Set the URI for the VHD that you uploaded or copied. In this example, the VHD file named **myOsDisk.vhd** is kept in a storage account named **myStorageAccount** in a container named **myContainer**.

    ```powershell
    $osDiskUri = "https://myStorageAccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/myOsDisk.vhd"
    ```
2. Add the OS disk. In this example, when the OS disk is created, the term "osDisk" is appended to the VM name to create the OS disk name. This example also specifies that this Windows-based VHD should be attached to the VM as the OS disk.
    
	```powershell
    $osDiskName = $vmName + "osDisk"
    $vm = Set-AzVMOSDisk -VM $vm -Name $osDiskName -VhdUri $osDiskUri -CreateOption attach -Windows
    ```

Optional: If you have data disks that need to be attached to the VM, add the data disks by using the URLs of data VHDs and the appropriate Logical Unit Number (Lun).

```powershell
$dataDiskName = $vmName + "dataDisk"
$vm = Add-AzVMDataDisk -VM $vm -Name $dataDiskName -VhdUri $dataDiskUri -Lun 1 -CreateOption attach
```

When using a storage account, the data and operating system disk URLs look something like this: `https://StorageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/BlobContainerName/DiskName.vhd`. You can find this on the portal by browsing to the target storage container, clicking the operating system or data VHD that was copied, and then copying the contents of the URL.


### Complete the VM 

Create the VM using the configurations that we just created.

```powershell
#Create the new VM
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location -VM $vm
```

If this command was successful, you'll see output like this:

```powershell
RequestId IsSuccessStatusCode StatusCode ReasonPhrase
--------- ------------------- ---------- ------------
                         True         OK OK   

```

### Verify that the VM was created
You should see the newly created VM either in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), under **All services** > **Virtual machines**, or by using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
$vmList = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName
$vmList.Name
```

## Next steps
Sign in to your new virtual machine. For more information, see [How to connect and log on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows](connect-logon.md).
