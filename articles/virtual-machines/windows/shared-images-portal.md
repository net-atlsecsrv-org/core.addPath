# Create an Azure Shared Image Gallery using the portal

A [Shared Image Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md) simplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap deployment tasks like preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. 

The Shared Image Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others in your organization, within or across regions, within an AAD tenant. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group shared images. 

The gallery is a top-level resource that provides full role-based access control (RBAC). Images can be versioned, and you can choose to replicate each image version to a different set of Azure regions. The gallery only works with Managed Images.

The Shared Image Gallery feature has multiple resource types. We will be using or building these in this article:


[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-shared-image-gallery-resources](../../../includes/virtual-machines-shared-image-gallery-resources.md)]

When working through this article, replace the resource group and VM names where needed.


[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-shared-images-portal](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-shared-images-portal.md)]
 
## Create VMs

Now you can create one or more new VMs. This example creates a VM named *myVM*, in the *myResourceGroup*, in the *East US* datacenter.

1. Go to your image definition. You can use the resource filter to show all image definitions available.
1. On the page for your image definition, select **Create VM** from the menu at the top of the page.
1. For **Resource group**, select **Create new** and type *myResourceGroup* for the name.
1. In **Virtual machine name**, type *myVM*.
1. For **Region**, select *East US*.
1. For **Availability options**, leave the default of *No infrastructure redundancy required*.
1. The value for **Image** is automatically filled with the `latest` image version if you started from the page for the image definition.
1. For **Size**, choose a VM size from the list of available sizes and then choose **Select**.
1. Under **Administrator account**, if the image was generalized, you need to provide a username, such as *azureuser* and a password. The password must be at least 12 characters long and meet the [defined complexity requirements](faq.md#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm). If your image was specialized, the username and password fields will greyed out because the username and password for the source VM are used.
1. If you want to allow remote access to the VM, under **Public inbound ports**, choose **Allow selected ports** and then select **RDP (3389)** from the drop-down. If you don't want to allow remote access to the VM, leave **None** selected for **Public inbound ports**.
1. When you are finished, select the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.
1. After the VM passes validation, select **Create** at the bottom of the page to start the deployment.


## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the virtual machine, select **Delete**, then confirm the name of the resource group to delete.

If you want to delete individual resources, you need to delete them in reverse order. For example, to delete an image definition, you need to delete all of the image versions created from that image.

## Next steps

You can also create Shared Image Gallery resource using templates. There are several Azure Quickstart Templates available: 

- [Create a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-create/)
- [Create an Image Definition in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-definition-create/)
- [Create an Image Version in a Shared Image Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-sig-image-version-create/)
- [Create a VM from Image Version](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-vm-from-sig/)
