# Use Spot VMs in Azure

[!INCLUDE [common-spot-vms](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-spot-vms.md)]  


## Next steps
Use the [portal](spot-portal.md), [CLI](../linux/spot-cli.md) or [PowerShell](spot-powershell.md) to deploy Spot VMs.

You can also deploy a [scale set with Spot VM instances](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot.md).

If you encounter an error, see [Error codes](../error-codes-spot.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
