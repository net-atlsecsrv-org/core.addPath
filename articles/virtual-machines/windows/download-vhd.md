# Download a Windows VHD from Azure

In this article, you learn how to download a Windows virtual hard disk (VHD) file from Azure using the Azure portal.

## Stop the VM

A VHD canâ€™t be downloaded from Azure if it's attached to a running VM. You need to stop the VM to download a VHD. If you want to use a VHD as an [image](tutorial-custom-images.md) to create other VMs with new disks, you use [Sysprep](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--generalize--a-windows-installation) to generalize the operating system contained in the file and then stop the VM. To use the VHD as a disk for a new instance of an existing VM or data disk, you only need to stop and deallocate the VM.

To use the VHD as an image to create other VMs, complete these steps:

1.	If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.	[Connect to the VM](connect-logon.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json). 
3.	On the VM, open the Command Prompt window as an administrator.
4.	Change the directory to *%windir%\system32\sysprep* and run sysprep.exe.
5.	In the System Preparation Tool dialog box, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**, and make sure that **Generalize** is selected.
6.	In Shutdown Options, select **Shutdown**, and then click **OK**. 

To use the VHD as a disk for a new instance of an existing VM or data disk, complete these steps:

1.	On the Hub menu in the Azure portal, click **Virtual Machines**.
2.	Select the VM from the list.
3.	On the blade for the VM, click **Stop**.

## Generate SAS URL

To download the VHD file, you need to generate a [shared access signature (SAS)](../../storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) URL. When the URL is generated, an expiration time is assigned to the URL.

1.	On the menu of the blade for the VM, click **Disks**.
2.	Select the operating system disk for the VM, and then click **Export**.
3.	Set the expiration time of the URL to *36000*.
4.	Click **Generate URL**.

    ![Generate URL](./media/download-vhd/export-generate.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The expiration time is increased from the default to provide enough time to download the large VHD file for a Windows Server operating system. You can expect a VHD file that contains the Windows Server operating system to take several hours to download depending on your connection. If you are downloading a VHD for a data disk, the default time is sufficient.

## Download VHD

1.	Under the URL that was generated, click Download the VHD file.

    ![Download VHD](./media/download-vhd/export-download.png)

2.	You may need to click **Save** in the browser to start the download. The default name for the VHD file is *abcd*.

    ![Click Save in the browser](./media/download-vhd/export-save.png)
