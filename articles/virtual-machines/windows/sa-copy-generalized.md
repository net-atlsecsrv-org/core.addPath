# How to create an unmanaged VM image from an Azure VM

This article covers using storage accounts. We recommend that you use managed disks and managed images instead of a storage account. For more information, see [Capture a managed image of a generalized VM in Azure](capture-image-resource.md).

This article shows you how to use Azure PowerShell to create an image of a generalized Azure VM using a storage account. You can then use the image to create another VM. The image includes the OS disk and the data disks that are attached to the virtual machine. The image doesn't include the virtual network resources, so you need to set up those resources when you create the new VM. 

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az.md](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Generalize the VM 
This section shows you how to generalize your Windows virtual machine for use as an image. Generalizing a VM removes all your personal account information, among other things, and prepares the machine to be used as an image. For details about Sysprep, see [How to Use Sysprep: An Introduction](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb457073.aspx).

Make sure the server roles running on the machine are supported by Sysprep. For more information, see [Sysprep Support for Server Roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/sysprep-support-for-server-roles)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are uploading your VHD to Azure for the first time, make sure you have [prepared your VM](prepare-for-upload-vhd-image.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) before running Sysprep. 
> 
> 

You can also generalize a Linux VM using `sudo waagent -deprovision+user` and then use PowerShell to capture the VM. For information about using the CLI to capture a VM, see [How to generalize and capture a Linux virtual machine using the Azure CLI](../linux/capture-image.md).


1. Sign in to the Windows virtual machine.
2. Open the Command Prompt window as an administrator. Change the directory to **%windir%\system32\sysprep**, and then run `sysprep.exe`.
3. In the **System Preparation Tool** dialog box, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**, and make sure that the **Generalize** check box is selected.
4. In **Shutdown Options**, select **Shutdown**.
5. Click **OK**.
   
    ![Start Sysprep](./media/upload-generalized-managed/sysprepgeneral.png)
6. When Sysprep completes, it shuts down the virtual machine. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not restart the VM until you are done uploading the VHD to Azure or creating an image from the VM. If the VM accidentally gets restarted, run Sysprep to generalize it again.

## Log in to Azure PowerShell
1. Open Azure PowerShell and sign in to your Azure account.
   
    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```
   
    A pop-up window opens for you to enter your Azure account credentials.
2. Get the subscription IDs for your available subscriptions.
   
    ```powershell
    Get-AzSubscription
    ```
3. Set the correct subscription using the subscription ID.
   
    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscriptionID>"
    ```

## Deallocate the VM and set the state to generalized

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You cannot add, edit or remove tags from a VM once it is marked as generalized. If you want to add a tag to the VM, make sure you add the tags before marking it as generalized.
> 

1. Deallocate the VM resources.
   
    ```powershell
    Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroup> -Name <vmName>
    ```
   
    The *Status* for the VM in the Azure portal changes from **Stopped** to **Stopped (deallocated)**.
2. Set the status of the virtual machine to **Generalized**. 
   
    ```powershell
    Set-AzVm -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroup> -Name <vmName> -Generalized
    ```
3. Check the status of the VM. The **OSState/generalized** section for the VM should have the **DisplayStatus** set to **VM generalized**.  
   
    ```powershell
    $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroup> -Name <vmName> -Status
    $vm.Statuses
    ```

## Create the image

Create an unmanaged virtual machine image in the destination storage container using this command. The image is created in the same storage account as the original virtual machine. The `-Path` parameter saves a copy of the JSON template for the source VM to your local computer. The `-DestinationContainerName` parameter is the name of the container that you want to hold your images. If the container doesn't exist, it is created for you.
   
```powershell
Save-AzVMImage -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -Name <vmName> `
    -DestinationContainerName <destinationContainerName> -VHDNamePrefix <templateNamePrefix> `
    -Path <C:\local\Filepath\Filename.json>
```
   
You can get the URL of your image from the JSON file template. Go to the **resources** > **storageProfile** > **osDisk** > **image** > **uri** section for the complete path of your image. The URL of the image looks like: `https://<storageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/system/Microsoft.Compute/Images/<imagesContainer>/<templatePrefix-osDisk>.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.vhd`.
   
You can also verify the URI in the portal. The image is copied to a container named **system** in your storage account. 

## Create a VM from the image

Now you can create one or more VMs from the unmanaged image.

### Set the URI of the VHD

The URI for the VHD to use is in the format: https://**mystorageaccount**.blob.core.windows.net/**mycontainer**/**MyVhdName**.vhd. In this example the VHD named **myVHD** is in the storage account **mystorageaccount** in the container **mycontainer**.

```powershell
$imageURI = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myVhd.vhd"
```


### Create a virtual network
Create the vNet and subnet of the [virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

1. Create the subnet. The following sample creates a subnet named **mySubnet** in the resource group **myResourceGroup** with the address prefix of **10.0.0.0/24**.  
   
    ```powershell
    $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
    $subnetName = "mySubnet"
    $singleSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
    ```
2. Create the virtual network. The following sample creates a virtual network named **myVnet** in the **West US** location with the address prefix of **10.0.0.0/16**.  
   
    ```powershell
    $location = "West US"
    $vnetName = "myVnet"
    $vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $singleSubnet
    ```    

### Create a public IP address and network interface
To enable communication with the virtual machine in the virtual network, you need a [public IP address](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md) and a network interface.

1. Create a public IP address. This example creates a public IP address named **myPip**. 
   
    ```powershell
    $ipName = "myPip"
    $pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $ipName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AllocationMethod Dynamic
    ```       
2. Create the NIC. This example creates a NIC named **myNic**. 
   
    ```powershell
    $nicName = "myNic"
    $nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name $nicName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id
    ```

### Create the network security group and an RDP rule
To be able to log in to your VM using RDP, you need to have a security rule that allows RDP access on port 3389. 

This example creates an NSG named **myNsg** that contains a rule called **myRdpRule** that allows RDP traffic over port 3389. For more information about NSGs, see [Opening ports to a VM in Azure using PowerShell](nsg-quickstart-powershell.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).

```powershell
$nsgName = "myNsg"

$rdpRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myRdpRule -Description "Allow RDP" `
    -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 110 `
    -SourceAddressPrefix Internet -SourcePortRange * `
    -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange 3389

$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
    -Name $nsgName -SecurityRules $rdpRule
```


### Create a variable for the virtual network
Create a variable for the completed virtual network. 

```powershell
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vnetName
```

### Create the VM
The following PowerShell completes the virtual machine configurations and uses unmanaged image as the source for the new installation.

</br>

```powershell
    # Enter a new user name and password to use as the local administrator account 
    # for remotely accessing the VM.
    $cred = Get-Credential

    # Name of the storage account where the VHD is located. This example sets the 
    # storage account name as "myStorageAccount"
    $storageAccName = "myStorageAccount"

    # Name of the virtual machine. This example sets the VM name as "myVM".
    $vmName = "myVM"

    # Size of the virtual machine. This example creates "Standard_D2_v2" sized VM. 
    # See the VM sizes documentation for more information: 
    # https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/
    $vmSize = "Standard_D2_v2"

    # Computer name for the VM. This examples sets the computer name as "myComputer".
    $computerName = "myComputer"

    # Name of the disk that holds the OS. This example sets the 
    # OS disk name as "myOsDisk"
    $osDiskName = "myOsDisk"

    # Assign a SKU name. This example sets the SKU name as "Standard_LRS"
    # Valid values for -SkuName are: Standard_LRS - locally redundant storage, Standard_ZRS - zone redundant
    # storage, Standard_GRS - geo redundant storage, Standard_RAGRS - read access geo redundant storage,
    # Premium_LRS - premium locally redundant storage. 
    $skuName = "Standard_LRS"

    # Get the storage account where the uploaded image is stored
    $storageAcc = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $rgName -AccountName $storageAccName

    # Set the VM name and size
    $vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize $vmSize

    #Set the Windows operating system configuration and add the NIC
    $vm = Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $vmConfig -Windows -ComputerName $computerName `
        -Credential $cred -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate
    $vm = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id

    # Create the OS disk URI
    $osDiskUri = '{0}vhds/{1}-{2}.vhd' `
        -f $storageAcc.PrimaryEndpoints.Blob.ToString(), $vmName.ToLower(), $osDiskName

    # Configure the OS disk to be created from the existing VHD image (-CreateOption fromImage).
    $vm = Set-AzVMOSDisk -VM $vm -Name $osDiskName -VhdUri $osDiskUri `
        -CreateOption fromImage -SourceImageUri $imageURI -Windows

    # Create the new VM
    New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location -VM $vm
```

### Verify that the VM was created
When complete, you should see the newly created VM in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **Browse** > **Virtual machines**, or by using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
    $vmList = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName
    $vmList.Name
```
