# Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
For customers with Software Assurance, Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server allows you to use your on-premises Windows Server licenses and run Windows virtual machines on Azure at a reduced cost. You can use Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server to deploy new virtual machines with Windows OS. This article goes over the steps on how to deploy new VMs with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server and how you can update existing running VMs. For more information about Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server licensing and cost savings, see the [Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server licensing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/).

> [!Important]
> Each 2-processor license or each set of 16-core licenses are entitled to two instances of up to 8 cores, or one instance of up to 16 cores. The Azure Hybrid Benefit for Standard Edition licenses can only be used once either on-premises or in Azure. Datacenter Edition benefits allow for simultaneous usage both on-premises and in Azure.
>

> [!Important]
> Using Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server with any VMs running Windows Server OS are now supported in all regions, including VMs with additional software such as SQL Server or third-party marketplace software. 
>

> [!NOTE]
> For classic VMs, only deploying new VM from on premises custom images is supported. To take advantage of the capabilities supported in this article, you must first migrate classic VMs to Resource Manager model.

## Ways to use Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
There are few ways to use Windows virtual machines with the Azure Hybrid Benefit:

1. You can deploy VMs from one of the provided  Windows Server images on the Azure Marketplace
2. You can  upload a custom VM and deploy using a Resource Manager template or Azure PowerShell
3. You can toggle and convert existing VM between running with Azure Hybrid Benefit or pay on-demand cost for Windows Server
4. You can also apply Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server on virtual machine scale set as well


## Create a VM with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
All Windows Server OS based images are supported for Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server. You can use Azure platform support images or upload your own custom Windows Server images. 

### Portal
To create a VM with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server, use the toggle under the "Save money" section.

### PowerShell


```powershell
New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myVM" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -ImageName "Win2016Datacenter" `
    -LicenseType "Windows_Server"
```

### CLI
```azurecli
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --location eastus \
    --license-type Windows_Server
```

### Template
Within your Resource Manager templates, an additional parameter `licenseType` must be specified. You can read more about [authoring Azure Resource Manager templates](../../resource-group-authoring-templates.md)
```json
"properties": {
    "licenseType": "Windows_Server",
    "hardwareProfile": {
        "vmSize": "[variables('vmSize')]"
    }
```

## Convert an existing VM using Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
If you have an existing VM that you would like to convert to take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server, you can update your VM's license type by following the instructions below.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the license type on the VM does not cause the system to reboot or cause a service interuption.  It is simply an update to a metadata flag.
> 

### Portal
From portal VM blade, you can update the VM to use Azure Hybrid Benefit by selecting "Configuration" option and toggle the "Azure hybrid benefit" option

### PowerShell
- Convert existing Windows Server VMs to Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server

    ```powershell
    $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup "rg-name" -Name "vm-name"
    $vm.LicenseType = "Windows_Server"
    Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName rg-name -VM $vm
    ```
    
- Convert Windows Server VMs with benefit back to pay-as-you-go

    ```powershell
    $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup "rg-name" -Name "vm-name"
    $vm.LicenseType = "None"
    Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName rg-name -VM $vm
    ```
    
### CLI
- Convert existing Windows Server VMs to Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server

    ```azurecli
    az vm update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --set licenseType=Windows_Server
    ```

### How to verify your VM is utilizing the licensing benefit
Once you have deployed your VM through either PowerShell, Resource Manager template or portal, you can verify the setting in the following methods.

### Portal
From portal VM blade, you can view the toggle for Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server by selecting "Configuration" tab.

### PowerShell
The following example shows the license type for a single VM
```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
```

Output:
```powershell
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : westus
LicenseType              : Windows_Server
```

This output contrasts with the following VM deployed without Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server licensing:
```powershell
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : westus
LicenseType              :
```

### CLI
```azurecli
az vm get-instance-view -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVM --query "[?licenseType=='Windows_Server']" -o table
```

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the license type on the VM does not cause the system to reboot or cause a service interuption. It is a metadata licensing flag only.
>

## List all VMs with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server in a subscription
To see and count all virtual machines deployed with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server, you can run the following command from your subscription:

### Portal
From the Virtual Machine or Virtual machine scale sets resource blade, you can view a list of all your VM(s) and licensing type by configuring the table column to include "Azure Hybrid Benefit". The VM setting can either be in "Enabled", "Not enabled" or "Not supported" state.

### PowerShell
```powershell
$vms = Get-AzVM
$vms | ?{$_.LicenseType -like "Windows_Server"} | select ResourceGroupName, Name, LicenseType
```

### CLI
```azurecli
az vm list --query "[?licenseType=='Windows_Server']" -o table
```

## Deploy a Virtual Machine Scale Set with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
Within your virtual machine scale set Resource Manager templates, an additional parameter `licenseType` must be specified within your VirtualMachineProfile property. You can do this during create or update for your scale set through ARM template, PowerShell, Azure CLI or REST.

The following example uses ARM template with a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter image:
```json
"virtualMachineProfile": {
    "storageProfile": {
        "osDisk": {
            "createOption": "FromImage"
        },
        "imageReference": {
            "publisher": "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
            "offer": "WindowsServer",
            "sku": "2016-Datacenter",
            "version": "latest"
        }
    },
    "licenseType": "Windows_Server",
    "osProfile": {
            "computerNamePrefix": "[parameters('vmssName')]",
            "adminUsername": "[parameters('adminUsername')]",
            "adminPassword": "[parameters('adminPassword')]"
    }
```
