# How to detach a data disk from a Windows virtual machine

When you no longer need a data disk that's attached to a virtual machine, you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the virtual machine, but doesn't remove it from storage.

> [!WARNING]
> If you detach a disk it is not automatically deleted. If you have subscribed to Premium storage, you will continue to incur storage charges for the disk. For more information, see [Pricing and Billing when using Premium Storage](disks-types.md#billing).

If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.

## Detach a data disk using PowerShell

You can *hot* remove a data disk using PowerShell, but make sure nothing is actively using the disk before detaching it from the VM.

In this example, we remove the disk named **myDisk** from the VM **myVM** in the **myResourceGroup** resource group. First you remove the disk using the [Remove-AzVMDataDisk](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvmdatadisk) cmdlet. Then, you update the state of the virtual machine, using the [Update-AzVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvm) cmdlet, to complete the process of removing the data disk.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$VirtualMachine = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
Remove-AzVMDataDisk -VM $VirtualMachine -Name "myDisk"
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VM $VirtualMachine
```

The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.

## Detach a data disk using the portal

1. In the left menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
2. Select the virtual machine that has the data disk you want to detach and click **Stop** to de-allocate the VM.
3. In the virtual machine pane, select **Disks**.
4. At the top of the **Disks** pane, select **Edit**.
5. In the **Disks** pane, to the far right of the data disk that you would like to detach, click the ![Detach button image](./media/detach-disk/detach.png) detach button.
5. After the disk has been removed, click **Save** on the top of the pane.
6. In the virtual machine pane, click **Overview** and then click the **Start** button at the top of the pane to restart the VM.

The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.

## Next steps

If you want to reuse the data disk, you can just [attach it to another VM](attach-managed-disk-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json)
