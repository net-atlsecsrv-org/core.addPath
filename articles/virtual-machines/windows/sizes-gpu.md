# GPU optimized virtual machine sizes

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs running Windows, NVIDIA or AMD GPU drivers must be installed. 

The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](../extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](../extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) for supported operating systems and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](../extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, and installation and verification steps.

To install AMD GPU drivers manually, see [N-series AMD GPU driver setup for Windows](n-series-amd-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, and installation and verification steps.
