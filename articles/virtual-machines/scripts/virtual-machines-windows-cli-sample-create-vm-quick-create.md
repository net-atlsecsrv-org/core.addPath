# Quick Create a virtual machine with the Azure CLI

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016. After running the script, you can access the virtual machine through a Remote Desktop connection.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-quick/create-windows-vm-quick.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and network security group. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used and administrative credentials.  |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
