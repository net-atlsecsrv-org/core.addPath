# Create a VM with NGINX

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine and uses the Azure Virtual Machine Custom Script Extension to install NGINX. After running the script, you can access a demo website on the public IP address of the virtual machine.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-nginx/create-vm-nginx.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Custom Script Extension

The custom script extension copies this script onto the virtual machine. The script is then run to install and configure an NGINX web server.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update package source
apt-get -y update

# install NGINX
apt-get -y install nginx
```

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule) | Creates a network security group rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 80 is opened for HTTP traffic. |
| [azure vm extension set](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Adds and runs a virtual machine extension to a VM. In this sample, the custom script extension is used to install NGINX.|
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
