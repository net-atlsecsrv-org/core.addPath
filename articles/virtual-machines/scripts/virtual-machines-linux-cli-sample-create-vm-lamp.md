# Deploy the LAMP stack in a load-balanced virtual machine scale set

This example creates a virtual machine scale set
and applies an extension that runs a custom script to deploy the LAMP stack
on each virtual machine in the scale set.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-scaleset-php-ansible/build-stack.sh "Create virtual machine scale set with LAMP stack")]

## Connect

Use this code to see how to connect to your VMs and your scale set.

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-scaleset-php-ansible/how-to-access.sh "Access the virtual machine scale set")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, the scale set and VMs, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete -n myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, availability set, load balancer, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vmss create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss) | Creates a virtual machine scale set |
| [az network lb rule create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/lb/rule) | Add a load-balanced endpoint |
| [az vmss extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss/extension) | Create the extension that runs the custom script on deployment of a VM |
| [az vmss update-instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss) | Run the custom script on the VM instances that were deployed before the extension was applied to the scale set. |
| [az vmss scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss) | Scale up the scale set by adding more VM instances. The custom script is run on these when they are deployed. |
| [az network public-ip list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/public-ip) | Get the IP addresses of the VMs created by the sample. |
| [az network lb show](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/lb) | Get the frontend and backend ports used by the load balancer. |
