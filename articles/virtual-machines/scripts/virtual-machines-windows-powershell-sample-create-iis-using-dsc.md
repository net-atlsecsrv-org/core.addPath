# Use an Azure PowerShell sample script to create an IIS VM

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016, and then uses the Azure Virtual Machine DSC Extension to install IIS. After running the script, you can access the default IIS website on the public IP address of the virtual machine.

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

 

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-dsc/create-windows-vm-iis-dsc.ps1 "Create VM IIS DSC")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create the deployment. Each item in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and network security group. This command also opens port 80 and sets the administrative credentials. |
| [Set-AzVMExtension](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmextension) | Add a VM extension to the virtual machine. In this sample, the DSC extension is used to install IIS. |
|[Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) | Removes a resource group and all resources contained within. |

## Next steps
