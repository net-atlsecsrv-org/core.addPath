# Create a VM with WordPress

This script creates a virtual machine, and then uses the Azure Virtual Machine custom script extension to install WordPress. After running the script, you can access the WordPress configuration site at  `http://<public IP of VM>/wordpress`.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-wordpress-mysql/create-wordpress-mysql.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm) | Creates a network security group rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 80 is opened for HTTP traffic. |
| [az vm extension set](/cli/azure/vm) | Add the Custom Script Extension to the virtual machine, which invokes a script to install WordPress. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure).

Additional virtual machine CLI script samples can be found in the [Azure Linux VM documentation](../linux/cli-samples.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
