# Copy snapshot of a managed disk to same or different subscription with CLI

This script copies a snapshot of a managed disk to same or different subscription. Use this script for the following scenarios:

1. Migrate a snapshot in Premium storage (Premium_LRS) to Standard storage (Standard_LRS or Standard_ZRS) to reduce your cost.
1. Migrate a snapshot from locally redundant storage (Premium_LRS, Standard_LRS) to zone redundant storage (Standard_ZRS) to benefit from the higher reliability of ZRS storage.
1. Move a snapshot to different subscription in the same region for longer retention.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/copy-snapshot-to-same-or-different-subscription/copy-snapshot-to-same-or-different-subscription.sh "Copy snapshot")]


## Script explanation

This script uses following commands to create a snapshot in the target subscription using the Id of the source snapshot. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az snapshot show](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/snapshot) | Gets all the properties of a snapshot using the name and resource group properties of the snapshot. Id property is used to copy the snapshot to different subscription.  |
| [az snapshot create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/snapshot) | Copies a snapshot by creating a snapshot in different subscription using the Id and name of the parent snapshot.  |
