# Create a managed disk from a snapshot with PowerShell

This script creates a managed disk from a snapshot. Use it to restore a virtual machine from snapshots of OS and data disks. Create OS and data managed disks from respective snapshots and then create a new virtual machine by attaching managed disks. You can also restore data disks of an existing VM by attaching data disks created from snapshots.
