# Copy managed disks to same or different subscription with CLI

This script copies a managed disk to same or different subscription but in the same region. The copy works only when the subscriptions are part of same Azure AD tenant.


[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/copy-managed-disks-to-same-or-different-subscription/copy-managed-disks-to-same-or-different-subscription.sh "Copy managed disk")]


## Script explanation

This script uses following commands to create a new managed disk in the target subscription using the Id of the source managed disk. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az disk show](/cli/azure/disk) | Gets all the properties of a managed disk using the name and resource group properties of the managed disk. Id property is used to copy the managed disk to different subscription.  |
| [az disk create](/cli/azure/disk) | Copies a managed disk by creating a new managed disk in different subscription using Id and name the parent managed disk.  |
