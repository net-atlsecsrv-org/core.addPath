# Create a managed disk from a snapshot with CLI

This script creates a managed disk from a snapshot. Use it to restore a virtual machine from snapshots of OS and data disks. Create OS and data managed disks from respective snapshots and then create a new virtual machine by attaching managed disks. You can also restore data disks of an existing VM by attaching data disks created from snapshots.


[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-managed-disks-from-snapshot/create-managed-disks-from-snapshot.sh "Create managed disk from snapshot")]
