# Monitor a VM with Azure Monitor logs

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine, installs the Log Analytics agent, and enrolls the system with a Log Analytics workspace. Once the script has run, the virtual machine will be visible in Azure Monitoring.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-monitor-oms/create-windows-vm-monitor-oms.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [azure vm extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Runs a VM extension against a virtual machine. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
