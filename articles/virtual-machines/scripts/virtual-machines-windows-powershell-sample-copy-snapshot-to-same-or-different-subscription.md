# Copy snapshot of a managed disk in same subscription or different subscription with PowerShell

This script copies a snapshot of a managed disk to same or different subscription. Use this script for the following scenarios:

1. Migrate a snapshot in Premium storage (Premium_LRS) to Standard storage (Standard_LRS or Standard_ZRS) to reduce your cost.
1. Migrate a snapshot from locally redundant storage (Premium_LRS, Standard_LRS) to zone redundant storage (Standard_ZRS) to benefit from the higher reliability of ZRS storage.
1. Move a snapshot to different subscription in the same region for longer retention.
