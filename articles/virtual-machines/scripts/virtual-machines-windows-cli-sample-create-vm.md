# Create a virtual machine with the Azure CLI

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016. After running the script, you can access the virtual machine through a Remote Desktop connection.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-detailed/create-windows-vm-detailed.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet) | Creates an Azure virtual network and subnet. |
| [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip) | Creates a public IP address with a static IP address and an associated DNS name. |
| [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg) | Creates a network security group (NSG), which is a security boundary between the internet and the virtual machine. |
| [az network nic create](/cli/azure/network/nic) | Creates a virtual network card and attaches it to the virtual network, subnet, and NSG. |
| [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
