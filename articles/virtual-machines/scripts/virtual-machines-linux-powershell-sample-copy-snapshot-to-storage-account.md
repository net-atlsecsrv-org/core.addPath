# Export/Copy managed snapshots as VHD to a storage account in different region with PowerShell

This script exports a managed snapshot to a storage account in different region. It first generates the SAS URI of the snapshot and then uses it to copy it to a storage account in different region. Use this script to maintain backup of your managed disks in different region for disaster recovery.  

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

 

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/virtual-machine/copy-snapshot-to-storage-account/copy-snapshot-to-storage-account.ps1 "Copy snapshot")]


## Script explanation

This script uses following commands to generate SAS URI for a managed snapshot and copies the snapshot to a storage account using SAS URI. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [Grant-AzSnapshotAccess](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azdisk) | Generates SAS URI for a snapshot that is used to copy it to a storage account. |
| [New-AzureStorageContext](/powershell/module/azure.storage/new-azurestoragecontext) | Creates a storage account context using the account name and key. This context can be used to perform read/write operations on the storage account. |
| [Start-AzureStorageBlobCopy](/powershell/module/azure.storage/start-azurestorageblobcopy) | Copies the underlying VHD of a snapshot to a storage account |
