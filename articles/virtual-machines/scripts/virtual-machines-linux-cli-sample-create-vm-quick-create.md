# Create a virtual machine

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine with an Ubuntu operating system and related networking resources. After running the script, you can access the virtual machine over SSH.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-quick/create-vm-quick.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and network security group. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used and administrative credentials.  |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure).

Additional virtual machine CLI script samples can be found in the [Azure Linux VM documentation](../linux/cli-samples.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
