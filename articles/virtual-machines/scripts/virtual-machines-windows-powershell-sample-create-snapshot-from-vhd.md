# Create a snapshot from a VHD to create multiple identical managed disks in small amount of time with PowerShell (Windows)

This script creates a snapshot from a VHD file in a storage account in same or different subscription. Use this script to import a specialized (not generalized/sysprepped) VHD to a snapshot and then use the snapshot to create multiple identical managed disks in small amount of time. Also, use it to import a data VHD to a snapshot and then use the snapshot to create multiple managed disks in small amount of time.
