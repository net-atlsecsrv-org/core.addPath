# Create a managed disk from a VHD file in a storage account in the same subscription with CLI

This script creates a managed disk from a VHD file in a storage account in the same subscription. Use this script to import a specialized (not generalized/sysprepped) VHD to managed OS disk to create a virtual machine. Or, use it to import a data VHD to managed data disk. 


[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-managed-data-disks-from-vhd/create-managed-data-disks-from-vhd.sh "Create managed disk from VHD")]

This script uses following commands to create a managed disk from a VHD. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |

| [az disk create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/disk) | Creates a managed disk using URI of a VHD in a storage account in the same subscription |
