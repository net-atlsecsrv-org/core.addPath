# Export/Copy a snapshot to a storage account in different region with CLI

This script exports a managed snapshot to a storage account in different region. It first generates the SAS URI of the snapshot and then uses it to copy it to a storage account in different region. Use this script to maintain backup of your managed disks in different region for disaster recovery.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/copy-snapshots-to-storage-account/copy-snapshots-to-storage-account.sh "Copy snapshot")]

## Script explanation

This script uses following commands to generate SAS URI for a managed snapshot and copies the snapshot to a storage account using SAS URI. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az snapshot grant-access](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/snapshot) | Generates read-only SAS that is used to copy underlying VHD file to a storage account or download it to on-premises  |
| [az storage blob copy start](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/blob/copy) | Copies a blob asynchronously from one storage account to another |
