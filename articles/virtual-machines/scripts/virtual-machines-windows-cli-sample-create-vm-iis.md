# Create a virtual machine with the Azure CLI with a custom script to install IIS

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016, and uses the Azure Virtual Machine Custom Script Extension to install IIS. After running the script, you can access the default IIS website on the public IP address of the virtual machine.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-windows-iis/create-vm-windows-iis.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and network security group. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used and administrative credentials.  |
| [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule) | Creates a network security group rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 80 is opened for HTTP traffic. |
| [azure vm extension set](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Adds and runs a virtual machine extension to a VM. In this sample, the custom script extension is used to install IIS.|
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/vm/extension) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure).

Additional virtual machine CLI script samples can be found in the [Azure Windows VM documentation](../windows/cli-samples.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).
