# What are solutions for running Oracle WebLogic Server on the Azure Kubernetes Service?

This page describes the solutions for running Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These solutions are jointly developed and supported by Oracle and Microsoft.

It's also possible to run WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machines. The solutions to do so are described in [this Microsoft article](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-weblogic).

WebLogic Server is a leading Java application server running some of the most mission critical enterprise Java applications across the globe. WebLogic Server forms the middleware foundation for the Oracle software suite. Oracle and Microsoft are committed to empowering WebLogic Server customers with choice and flexibility to run workloads on Azure as a leading cloud platform.

## WLS on AKS certified and supported
WebLogic Server is certified by Oracle and Microsoft to run well on AKS. The WebLogic Server on AKS solutions are aimed at making it as easy as possible to run your containerized and orchestrated Java EE applications on Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure. The solutions are focused on reliability, scalability, manageability, and enterprise support.

WebLogic Server clusters are fully enabled to run on Kubernetes via the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (referred to simply as the 'Operator' from here onward). The Operator follows the standard Kubernetes operator pattern. It simplifies the management and operation of WebLogic domains and deployments on Kubernetes by automating otherwise manual tasks and adding additional operational reliability features. The Operator supports Oracle WebLogic Server 12c, Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 12c and beyond. We've tested the official Docker images for WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 and 12.2.1.4 with the Operator. For details on the Operator, refer to the [official documentation from Oracle](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/).

## Guidance, scripts, and samples for WLS on AKS
Beyond certifying WebLogic Server on AKS, Oracle and Microsoft jointly provide detailed instructions, scripts, and samples for running WebLogic Server on AKS. The guidance is incorporated into the Azure Kubernetes Service sample section of the [Operator documentation](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/samples/simple/azure-kubernetes-service/). The guidance is aimed at making production WebLogic Server on AKS deployments as easy as possible. The guidance uses official WebLogic Server Docker images provided by Oracle. Failover is achieved via Azure Files accessed through Kubernetes persistent volume claims. Azure Load Balancers are supported when provisioned using a Kubernetes Service of type 'LoadBalancer'. The guidance allows a high degree of configuration and customization.

The guidance currently assumes deploying the domain outside the Docker image and using the standard Docker images from Oracle. We'll add guidance for enabling custom images with your domain inside a Docker image. Further ease-of-use and Azure service integrations are possible in the future via Marketplace offerings mirroring Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machines solutions.

_These solutions are Bring-Your-Own-License_. They assume you've already got the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Azure.

_If you're interested in working closely on your migration scenarios with the engineering team developing these solutions, fill out [this short survey](https://aka.ms/wls-on-azure-survey) and include your contact information_. Program managers, architects, and engineers will reach back out to you shortly and start close collaboration. The opportunity to collaborate on a migration scenario is free while the solutions are under active initial development.

## Deployment architectures

The solutions for running Oracle WebLogic Server on the Azure Kubernetes Service will enable a wide range of production-ready deployment architectures with relative ease.

Beyond what the solutions provide customers have complete flexibility to customize their deployments further. It's likely on top of deploying applications customers will integrate further Azure resources with their deployments. Customers are encouraged to provide feedback in the survey on further improving the solutions.
