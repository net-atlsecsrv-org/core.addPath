# What is Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure?

This page describes solutions for running WebLogic Server (WLS) on Azure Virtual Machines.  These solutions are jointly developed by Oracle and Microsoft.

Oracle WebLogic Server is the worldâ€™s first cloud native, enterprise Java platform application server for developing and deploying multi-tier distributed enterprise applications. Azure WebLogic Server offers enable you to embrace cloud computing.  You get greater choice and flexibility for WebLogic migration including lift and shift of your Java EE applications to Azure Cloud.   WLS on Azure yields big impact with a small effort. The offers empower you to start your line of business (LOB) applications quickly.  Each offer automatically provisions virtual network, storage and Linux resources.  With zero effort, WebLogic Server is installed.  WLS on Azure sets up security with a network security group, load balancing with Azure App Gateway, authentication with Azure Active Directory and automatically connects to your existing database.

There are four offers available to meet different scenarios: single node without an admin server, single node with an admin server, cluster, and dynamic cluster.  Try the offers, they're available free of charge.

_These offers are Bring-Your-Own-License_. They assume you've already got the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Microsoft Azure.

_If you want to work closely on your migration scenarios with the engineering team developing these offers, select the [CONTACT ME](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/oracle.oraclelinux-wls-cluster?tab=Overview) button_ in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/oracle.oraclelinux-wls-cluster?tab=Overview). Program managers, architects, and engineers will reach back out to you shortly and start collaboration!

## Oracle WebLogic Server Single Node

This offer provisions a single virtual machine and installs WLS on it. It doesn't create a domain or start the Administration Server. Single node is useful for scenarios with highly customized domain configuration.

## Oracle WebLogic Server with Admin Server

This offer provisions a single virtual machine and installs WLS on it. It creates a domain and starts up the Administration Server, which allows you to manage the domain.

## Oracle WebLogic Server Cluster

This offer creates a highly available cluster of WLS virtual machines. The Administration Server and all managed servers are started by default, which allow you to manage the domain.

## Oracle WebLogic Server Dynamic Cluster

This offer creates a highly available and scalable dynamic cluster of WLS virtual machines. The Administration Server and all managed servers are started by default, which allow you to manage the domain.
