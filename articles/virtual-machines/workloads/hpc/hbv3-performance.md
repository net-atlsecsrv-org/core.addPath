# HBv3-series virtual machine performance

Performance expectations using common HPC microbenchmarks are as follows:

| Workload                                        | HBv3                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STREAM Triad                                    | 330-350 GB/s (~82-86 GB/s per NUMA)                                     |
| High-Performance Linpack (HPL)                  | 4 TF (Rpeak, FP64), 8 TF (Rpeak, FP32) for 120-core VM size               |
| RDMA latency & bandwidth                        | 1.2 microseconds (1-byte), 192 Gb/s (one-way)                                        |
| FIO on local NVMe SSDs (RAID0)                  | 7 GB/s reads, 3 GB/s writes; 186k IOPS reads, 201k IOPS writes |

## Process pinning

[Process pinning](compiling-scaling-applications.md#process-pinning) works well on HBv3-series VMs because we expose the underlying silicon as-is to the guest VM. We strongly recommend process pinning for optimal performance and consistency.

## MPI latency

The MPI latency test from the OSU microbenchmark suite can be executed per below. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).

```bash 
./bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./osu_latency
``` 
## MPI bandwidth
The MPI bandwidth test from the OSU microbenchmark suite can be executed per below. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).
```bash
./mvapich2-2.3.install/bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./mvapich2-2.3/osu_benchmarks/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bw
```
## Mellanox Perftest
The [Mellanox Perftest package](https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/perftest-package) has many InfiniBand tests such as latency (ib_send_lat) and bandwidth (ib_send_bw). An example command is below.
```console
numactl --physcpubind=[INSERT CORE #]  ib_send_lat -a
```
