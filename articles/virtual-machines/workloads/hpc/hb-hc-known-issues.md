# Known issues with H-series and N-series VMs

This article provides the most common issues and solutions when using the [H-series](../../sizes-hpc.md) and [N-series](../../sizes-gpu.md) HPC and GPU VMs.

## InfiniBand driver installation on N-series VMs

NC24r_v3 and ND40r_v2 are SR-IOV enabled while NC24r and NC24r_v2 are not SR-IOV enabled. Some details on the bifurcation [here](../../sizes-hpc.md#rdma-capable-instances).
InfiniBand (IB) can be configured on the SR-IOV enabled VM sizes with the OFED drivers while the non-SR-IOV VM sizes require ND drivers. This IB support is available appropriately on [CentOS-HPC VMIs](configure.md). For Ubuntu, see the [instruction here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-compute/configuring-infiniband-for-ubuntu-hpc-and-gpu-vms/ba-p/1221351) for installing both the OFED and ND drivers as described in the [docs](enable-infiniband.md#vm-images-with-infiniband-drivers).

## Duplicate MAC with cloud-init with Ubuntu on H-series and N-series VMs

There is a known issue with cloud-init on Ubuntu VM images as it tries to bring up the IB interface. This can happen either on VM reboot or when trying to create a VM image after generalization. The VM boot logs may show an error like so: “Starting Network Service...RuntimeError: duplicate mac found! both 'eth1' and 'ib0' have mac”.

This 'duplicate MAC with cloud-init on Ubuntu" is a known issue. The workaround is:
1) Deploy the (Ubuntu 18.04) marketplace VM image
2) Install the necessary software packages to enable IB ([instruction here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-compute/configuring-infiniband-for-ubuntu-hpc-and-gpu-vms/ba-p/1221351))
3) Edit waagent.conf to change EnableRDMA=y
4) Disable networking in cloud-init
    ```console
    echo network: {config: disabled} | sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
    ```
5) Edit netplan's networking configuration file generated by cloud-init to remove the MAC
    ```console
    sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml" <<'EOF'
    network:
        ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
        version: 2
    EOF
    ```

## DRAM on HB-series

HB-series VMs can only expose 228 GB of RAM to guest VMs at this time. This is due to a known limitation of Azure hypervisor to prevent pages from being assigned to the local DRAM of AMD CCX’s (NUMA domains) reserved for the guest VM.

## Accelerated Networking

Azure Accelerated Networking on IB-enabled HPC and GPU VMs is not enabled at this time. We will notify customers when this feature is supported.

## qp0 Access Restriction

To prevent low-level hardware access that can result in security vulnerabilities, Queue Pair 0 is not accessible to guest VMs. This should only affect actions typically associated with administration of the ConnectX-5 NIC, and running some InfiniBand diagnostics like ibdiagnet, but not end-user applications themselves.

## GSS Proxy

GSS Proxy has a known bug in CentOS/RHEL 7.5 that can manifest as a significant performance and responsiveness penalty when used with NFS. This can be mitigated with:

```console
sed -i 's/GSS_USE_PROXY="yes"/GSS_USE_PROXY="no"/g' /etc/sysconfig/nfs
```

## Cache Cleaning

On HPC systems, it is often useful to clean up the memory after a job has finished before the next user is assigned the same node. After running applications in Linux you may find that your available memory reduces while your buffer memory increases, despite not running any applications.

Using `numactl -H` will show which NUMAnode(s) the memory is buffered with (possibly all). In Linux, users can clean the caches in three ways to return buffered or cached memory to ‘free’. You need to be root or have sudo permissions.

```console
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches [frees page-cache]
echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches [frees slab objects e.g. dentries, inodes]
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches [cleans page-cache and slab objects]
```

## Kernel warnings

You may ignore the following kernel warning messages when booting an HB-series VM under Linux. This is due to a known limitation of the Azure hypervisor that will be addressed over time.

```console
