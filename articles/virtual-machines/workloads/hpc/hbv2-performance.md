# HBv2-series virtual machine sizes

Several performance tests have been run on [HBv2-series](../../hbv2-series.md) size VMs. The following are some of the results of this performance testing.


| Workload                                        | HBv2                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STREAM Triad                                    | 350 GB/s (21-23 GB/s per CCX)                                     |
| High-Performance Linpack (HPL)                  | 4 TeraFLOPS (Rpeak, FP64), 8 TeraFLOPS (Rmax, FP32)               |
| RDMA latency & bandwidth                        | 1.2 microseconds, 190 Gb/s                                        |
| FIO on local NVMe SSD                           | 2.7 GB/s reads, 1.1 GB/s writes; 102k IOPS reads, 115 IOPS writes |
| IOR on 8 * Azure Premium SSD (P40 Managed Disks, RAID0)**  | 1.3 GB/s reads,  2.5 GB/writes; 101k IOPS reads, 105k IOPS writes |


## MPI latency

MPI latency test from the OSU microbenchmark suite is run. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).


```bash 
./bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./osu_latency
```

## MPI bandwidth

MPI bandwidth test from the OSU microbenchmark suite is run. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).


```bash
./mvapich2-2.3.install/bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./mvapich2-2.3/osu_benchmarks/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bw
```

## Mellanox Perftest

The [Mellanox Perftest package](https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/perftest-package) has many InfiniBand tests such as latency (ib_send_lat) and bandwidth (ib_send_bw). An example command is below. 


```console
numactl --physcpubind=[INSERT CORE #]  ib_send_lat -a
```
