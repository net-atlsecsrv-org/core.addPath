# Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Extended Lifecycle Support
This article provides information on Extended Lifecycle Support for the Red Hat Enterprise images:
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Lifecycle
Starting on 30 November 2020, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will reach end of maintenance phase. The maintenance phase is followed by the Extended Life Phase. As Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 transitions out of the Full/Maintenance Phases, it is strongly recommended upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or 8.
