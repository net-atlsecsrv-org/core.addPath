# Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) images available in Azure
Azure offers a variety of RHEL images for different use cases.

> [!NOTE]
> All RHEL images are available in Azure public and Azure Government clouds. They are not available in Azure China clouds.

## List of RHEL images
This is a list of RHEL images available in Azure. Unless otherwise stated, all images are LVM-partitioned and attached to regular RHEL repositories (not EUS, not E4S). The following images are currently available for general use:
