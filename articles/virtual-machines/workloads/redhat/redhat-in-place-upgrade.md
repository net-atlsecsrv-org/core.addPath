# Red Hat Enterprise Linux in-place upgrades

This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform an in-place upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 using the 'Leapp' utility on Azure. During the in-place upgrade, the existing RHEL 7 operating system is replaced by RHEL 8 version.

>[!Note] 
> SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux offers do not support in-place upgrade on Azure.

## What to expect during the upgrade
The system will reboot a few times during the upgrade and that is normal. The last reboot will upgrade the VM into RHEL 8 latest minor release.

## Preparations for the upgrade
In-place upgrades are the officially recommended way by Red Hat and Azure to allow customers to upgrade your system to the next major version. 
Before performing the upgrade here are some things, you should be aware of and take into consideration. 

>[!Important] 
> Please take a Snapshot of the image before performing the upgrade.

>[!NOTE]
> The commands in this article need to be run using the root account

* Make sure you are using the latest RHEL 7 version, which currently is RHEL 7.9. If you are using a locked version and cannot upgrade to RHEL 7.9, you can use the [steps here to switch to a non EUS repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/redhat/redhat-rhui#switch-a-rhel-7x-vm-back-to-non-eus-remove-a-version-lock).

* Run the command below to know how your upgrade is going and if it will complete. The command should generate a file under '/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt' that explains the process and what is being done and if the upgrade is possible or not
    ```bash
    leapp preupgrade --no-rhsm
    ```

## Steps for performing the upgrade

Perform these steps carefully. It is definitely recommended to try the upgrade on a test machine before production instances.

1. Perform a yum update to fetch the latest client packages.
    ```bash
    yum update
    ```

1. Install the leapp-client-package.
    ```bash
    yum install leapp-rhui-azure
    ```
    
1. Use leapp-data.tar.gz file with repomap.csv and pes-events.json, present in [RedHat portal](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3664871), and extract them. 
    1. Download the file.
    1. Extract the contents and remove the file using the following command:
    ```bash
     tar -xzf leapp-data12.tar.gz -C /etc/leapp/files && rm leapp-data12.tar.gz
    ```
    


1. Add 'answers' file for 'Leapp'.
    ```bash
    leapp answer --section remove_pam_pkcs11_module_check.confirm=True --add
    ```
    
1. Enable PermitRootLogin in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    1. Open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    1. Search for '#PermitRootLogin yes'
    1. Remove the '#' to uncomment



1. Perform 'Leapp' upgrade.
    ```bash
    leapp upgrade --no-rhsm
    ```
1. Restart sshd service for the changes to take effect
    ```bash
    systemctl restart sshd
    ```
1. Comment out PermitRootLogin in /etc/ssh/sshd_config again
    1. Open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    1. Search for '#PermitRootLogin yes'
    1. Add the '#' to comment
