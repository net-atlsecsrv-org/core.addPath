In this document, covers several different areas to consider when deploying SAP ASE in Azure IaaS. As a precondition to this document, you should have read the document [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](dbms_guide_general.md) and other guides in the [SAP workload on Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/get-started). 

## Specifics to SAP ASE on Windows
Starting with Microsoft Azure, you can migrate your existing SAP ASE applications to Azure Virtual Machines. SAP ASE in an Azure Virtual Machine enables you to reduce the total cost of ownership of deployment, management, and maintenance of enterprise breadth applications by easily migrating these applications to Microsoft Azure. With SAP ASE in an Azure Virtual Machine, administrators and developers can still use the same development and administration tools that are available on-premises.

SLAs for Azure Virtual Machines, can be found here: <https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines>

Microsoft Azure offers numerous different virtual machine types that allow you to run smallest SAP systems and landscapes up to large SAP systems and landscapes with thousands of users. SAP sizing SAPS numbers of the different SAP certified VM SKUs is provided in SAP Note [1928533].

Statements and recommendations regarding to the usage of Azure Storage, Deployment of SAP VMs or SAP Monitoring made in [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](dbms_guide_general.md) apply to deployments of SAP ASE too.

### SAP ASE Version Support
SAP currently supports SAP ASE version 16.0 for use with SAP Business Suite products. All updates for SAP ASE server, or JDBC and ODBC drivers to be used with SAP Business Suite products are provided solely through the SAP Service Marketplace at: <https://support.sap.com/swdc>.

Do not download updates for the SAP ASE server, or for the JDBC and ODBC drivers directly from Sybase websites. For detailed information on patches, which are supported for use with SAP products on-premises and in Azure Virtual Machines see the following SAP Notes:

* [1590719]
* [1973241]

General information on running SAP Business Suite on SAP ASE can be found in the [SCN](https://www.sap.com/community/topic/ase.html)

### SAP ASE Configuration Guidelines for SAP-related SAP ASE Installations in Azure VMs
#### Structure of the SAP ASE Deployment
SAP ASE executables should be located or installed into the system drive of the VM's OS disk (drive c:\). Typically, most of the SAP ASE system and tools databases are not experiencing high workload. Hence the system and tools databases (master, model, saptools, sybmgmtdb, sybsystemdb) can remain on the C:\ drive. 

An exception could be the temporary database, which in case of some SAP ERP and all BW workloads might require either higher data volume or I/O operations volume. Volumes or IOPS which can't be provided by the VM's OS disk (drive C:\).

Dependent on the version of SAPInst/SWPM used to install, the SAP ASE instance configuration could look like:

* A single SAP ASE tempdb, which is created when installing SAP ASE
* An SAP ASE tempdb created by installing SAP ASE and an additional saptempdb created by the SAP installation routine
* An SAP ASE tempdb created by installing SAP ASE and an additional tempdb that has been created manually (for example following SAP Note [1752266]) to meet ERP/BW specific tempdb requirements

Out of performance reasons for specific ERP or all BW workloads, it can make sense to store the tempdb devices of the additionally created tempdb on a drive other than C:\. If no additional tempdb exists, it is recommended to create one (SAP Note [1752266]).

For such systems the following steps should be executed for the additionally created tempdb:

* Move the first tempdb device to the first device of the SAP database
* Add tempdb devices to each of the VHDs containing a device of the SAP database

This configuration enables tempdb consume more space than the system drive can provide. As a reference one can check the tempdb device sizes on existing systems, which run on-premises. Or such a configuration enables IOPS numbers against tempdb, which cannot be provided with the system drive. Systems that are running on-premises can be used to monitor I/O workload against tempdb.

Never put any SAP ASE devices onto the D:\ drive of the VM. For SAP ASE, this advice also applies to the tempdb, even if the objects kept in the tempdb are only temporary.

For data and transaction log file deployments, the statements and suggestions made in [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](dbms_guide_general.md). In case of Windows-based, deployments the usage of Windows Storage Spaces is recommended to use to build stripe sets with sufficient IOPS, throughput, and volume.  

#### Impact of Database Compression
In configurations where I/O bandwidth can become a limiting factor, every measure, which reduces IOPS might help to stretch the workload one can run in an IaaS scenario like Azure. Therefore, it is recommended to make sure that SAP ASE compression is used before uploading an existing SAP database to Azure.

The recommendation to apply compression before uploading to Azure is given out of several reasons:

* The amount of data to be uploaded to Azure is lower
* The duration of the compression execution is shorter assuming that one can use stronger hardware with more CPUs or higher I/O bandwidth or less I/O latency on-premises
* Smaller database sizes might lead to less costs for disk allocation

Data- and LOB-Compression work in a VM hosted in Azure Virtual Machines as it does on-premises. For more details on how to check if compression is already in use in an existing SAP ASE database, check SAP Note [1750510].

#### Using DBACockpit to monitor Database Instances
For SAP systems, which are using SAP ASE as database platform, the DBACockpit is accessible as embedded browser windows in transaction DBACockpit or as Webdynpro. However the full functionality for monitoring and administering the database is available in the Webdynpro implementation of the DBACockpit only.

As with on-premises systems several steps are required to enable all SAP NetWeaver functionality used by the Webdynpro implementation of the DBACockpit. Follow SAP Note [1245200] to enable the usage of webdynpros and generate the required ones. When following the instructions in the above notes, you also configure the Internet Communication Manager (icm) along with the ports to be used for http and https connections. The default setting for http looks like:

> icm/server_port_0 = PROT=HTTP,PORT=8000,PROCTIMEOUT=600,TIMEOUT=600
> 
> icm/server_port_1 = PROT=HTTPS,PORT=443$$,PROCTIMEOUT=600,TIMEOUT=600
> 
> 

and the links generated in transaction DBACockpit looks similar to:

> https:\//\<fullyqualifiedhostname>:44300/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit
> 
> http:\//\<fullyqualifiedhostname>:8000/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit
> 
> 

Depending on how the Azure Virtual Machine hosting the SAP system is connected to your AD and DNS, you need to make sure that ICM is using a fully qualified hostname that can be resolved on the machine where you are opening the DBACockpit from. See SAP Note [773830] to understand how ICM determines the fully qualified host name based on profile parameters and set parameter icm/host_name_full explicitly if necessary.

If you deployed the VM in a Cloud-Only scenario without cross-premises connectivity between on-premises and Azure, you need to define a public IP address and a domainlabel. The format of the public DNS name of the VM looks like:

> `<custom domainlabel`>.`<azure region`>.cloudapp.azure.com
> 
> 

More details related to the DNS name can be found [here][virtual-machines-azurerm-versus-azuresm].

Setting the SAP profile parameter icm/host_name_full to the DNS name of the Azure VM the link might look similar to:

> https:\//mydomainlabel.westeurope.cloudapp.net:44300/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit
> 
> http:\//mydomainlabel.westeurope.cloudapp.net:8000/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit

In this case you need to make sure to:

* Add Inbound rules to the Network Security Group in the Azure portal for the TCP/IP ports used to communicate with ICM
* Add Inbound rules to the Windows Firewall configuration for the TCP/IP ports used to communicate with the ICM

For an automated imported of all corrections available, it is recommended to periodically apply the correction collection SAP Note applicable to your SAP version:

* [1558958]
* [1619967]
* [1882376]

Further information about DBA Cockpit for SAP ASE can be found in the following SAP Notes:

* [1758496]    
* [1814258]
* [1922555]
* [1956005]

#### Backup/Recovery Considerations for SAP ASE
When deploying SAP ASE into Azure, your backup methodology must be reviewed. Even for non-production systems, the SAP database(s) must be backed up periodically. Since Azure Storage keeps three images, a backup might be less important in respect to compensating a storage crash. The primary reason for maintaining a proper backup and restore plan is more that you can compensate for logical/manual errors by providing point in time recovery capabilities. So the goal is to either use backups to restore the database back to a certain point in time or to use the backups in Azure to seed another system by copying the existing database. 

Backing up and restoring a database in Azure works the same way as it does on-premises. See SAP Notes:

* [1588316]
* [1585981]

for details on creating dump configurations and scheduling backups. Depending on your strategy and needs you can configure database and log dumps to disk on to one of the existing disks, or add an additional disk for the backup. To reduce the danger of data loss in case of an error, it is recommended to use a disk where no database files are located.

Besides data- and LOB compression, SAP ASE also offers backup compression. To consume less space with the database and log dumps it is recommended to use backup compression. For more information, see SAP Note [1588316]. Compressing the backup is also crucial to reduce the amount of data to be transferred if you plan to download backups or VHDs containing backup dumps from the Azure Virtual Machine to on-premises.

Do not use drive D:\ as database or log dump destination.

#### Performance Considerations for Backups/Restores
As in bare-metal deployments, backup/restore performance is dependent on how many volumes can be read in parallel and what the throughput of those volumes might be. Keep in mind that backup compression consumes CPU resources. This CPU consumption of backup compression can play a significant role on VMs with small number of CPU threads. Therefore, you can assume:

* The fewer the number of disks used to store the database devices, the smaller the overall throughput in reading
* The smaller the number of CPU threads in the VM, the more severe the impact of backup compression
* The fewer targets (Stripe Directories, disks) to write the backup to, the lesser the throughput

To increase the number of targets to write to there are two options, which can be used/combined depending on your needs:

* Striping the backup target volume over multiple mounted disks to improve the IOPS throughput on that striped volume
* Creating a dump configuration on SAP ASE level, which uses more than one target directory to write the dump to

Striping a disk volume over multiple mounted disks has been discussed in [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](dbms_guide_general.md). For more information on using multiple directories in the SAP ASE dump configuration, refer to the documentation on Stored Procedure sp_config_dump, which is used to create the dump configuration on the [Sybase Infocenter](http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp).

### Disaster Recovery with Azure VMs
#### Data Replication with SAP Sybase Replication Server
With the SAP Sybase Replication Server (SRS), SAP ASE provides a warm standby solution to transfer database transactions to a distant location asynchronously. 

The installation and operation of SRS works as well functionally in a VM hosted in Azure Virtual Machine Services as it does on-premises.

SAP ASE HADR does not require an Azure Internal Load Balancer and has no dependencies on OS level clustering. It works on Azure Windows and Linux VMs. For details on SAP ASE HADR read the [SAP ASE HADR users guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/efe56ad3cad0467d837c8ff1ac6ba75c/16.0.3.3/en-US/a6645e28bc2b1014b54b8815a64b87ba.html).

## Specifics to SAP ASE on Linux
Starting with Microsoft Azure, you can easily migrate your existing SAP ASE applications to Azure Virtual Machines. SAP ASE in a Virtual Machine enables you to reduce the total cost of ownership of deployment, management, and maintenance of enterprise breadth applications by easily migrating these applications to Microsoft Azure. With SAP ASE in an Azure Virtual Machine, administrators and developers can still use the same development and administration tools that are available on-premises.

For deploying Azure VMs it's important to know the official SLAs, which can be found here: <https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla>

SAP sizing information and a list of SAP certified VM SKUs is provided in SAP Note [1928533]. Additional SAP sizing
documents for Azure Virtual machines can be found here <https://blogs.msdn.com/b/saponsqlserver/archive/2015/06/19/how-to-size-sap-systems-running-on-azure-vms.aspx> and here <https://blogs.msdn.com/b/saponsqlserver/archive/2015/12/01/new-white-paper-on-sizing-sap-solutions-on-azure-public-cloud.aspx>

Statements and recommendations regarding to the usage of Azure Storage, Deployment of SAP VMs, or SAP Monitoring apply to deployments of SAP ASE in conjunction with SAP applications as stated throughout the first four chapters of this document.

The following two SAP Notes include general information about ASE on Linux and ASE in the Cloud:

General information on running SAP Business Suite on SAP ASE can be found in the [SCN](https://www.sap.com/community/topic/ase.html)

### SAP ASE Configuration Guidelines for SAP-related SAP ASE Installations in Azure VMs
#### Structure of the SAP ASE Deployment
SAP ASE executables should be located or installed into the root file system of the VM ( /sybase ). Typically, most of the SAP ASE system and tools databases are not experiencing high workload. Hence the system and tools databases (master, model, saptools, sybmgmtdb, sybsystemdb) can be stored on the root file system. 

An exception could be the temporary database, which in case of some SAP ERP and all BW workloads might require either higher data volume or I/O operations volume. Volumes or IOPS which can't be provided by the VM's OS disk 

Depending on the version of SAPInst/SWPM used to install the system, the database might contain:

* A single SAP ASE tempdb created when installing SAP ASE
* An SAP ASE tempdb created by installing SAP ASE and an additional saptempdb created by the SAP installation routine
* An SAP ASE tempdb created by installing SAP ASE and an additional tempdb that has been created manually (for example following SAP Note [1752266]) to meet ERP/BW specific tempdb requirements

Out of performance reasons for specific ERP or all BW workloads, it can make sense to store the tempdb devices of the additionally created tempdb (by SWPM or manually) on a separate file system, which can be represented by a single Azure data disk or a Linux RAID spanning multiple Azure data disks. If no additional tempdb exists, it is recommended to create one (SAP Note [1752266]).

For such systems the following steps should be performed for the additionally created tempdb:

* Move the first tempdb directory to the first file system of the SAP database
* Add tempdb directories to each of the disks containing a filesystem of the SAP database

This configuration enables tempdb consume more space than the system drive can provide. As a reference one can check the tempdb device sizes on existing systems, which run on-premises. Or such a configuration enables IOPS numbers against tempdb, which cannot be provided with the system drive. Systems that are running on-premises can be used to monitor I/O workload against tempdb.

Never put any SAP ASE directories onto /mnt or /mnt/resource of the VM. For SAP ASE, this advice also applies to the tempdb, even if the objects kept in the tempdb are only temporary. Because /mnt or /mnt/resource is a default Azure VM temp space, which is not persistent. More details about the Azure VM temp space can be found in [this article][virtual-machines-linux-how-to-attach-disk]

For data and transaction log file deployments, the statements and suggestions made in [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](dbms_guide_general.md). In case of Linux-based deployments the usage of LVM or MDADM is recommended to use to build stripe sets with sufficient IOPS, throughput, and volume. 

#### Impact of Database Compression
In configurations where I/O bandwidth can become a limiting factor, every measure, which reduces IOPS might help to stretch the workload one can run in an IaaS scenario like Azure. Therefore, it is recommended to make sure that SAP ASE compression is used before uploading an existing SAP database to Azure.

* The amount of data to be uploaded to Azure is lower
* The duration of the compression execution is shorter assuming that one can use stronger hardware with more CPUs or higher I/O bandwidth or less I/O latency on-premises
* Smaller database sizes might lead to less costs for disk allocation

Data- and LOB-Compression work in a VM hosted in Azure Virtual Machines as it does on-premises. For more details on how to check if compression is already in use in an existing SAP ASE database, check SAP Note [1750510]. For more information regarding database compression, see SAP Note [2121797].

> 
> icm/server_port_1 = PROT=HTTPS,PORT=443$$,PROCTIMEOUT=600,TIMEOUT=600
> 
> 

and the links generated in transaction DBACockpit will look similar to this:

> https:\//\<fullyqualifiedhostname>:44300/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit
> 
> http:\//\<fullyqualifiedhostname>:8000/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit
> 
> 

Depending on how the Azure Virtual Machine hosting the SAP system is connected to your AD and DNS, you need to make sure that ICM is using a fully qualified hostname that can be resolved on the machine where you are opening the DBACockpit from. See SAP Note [773830] to understand how ICM determines the fully qualified host name depending on profile parameters and set parameter icm/host_name_full explicitly if necessary.

If you deployed the VM in a Cloud-Only scenario without cross-premises connectivity between on-premises and Azure, you need 
to define a public IP address and a domainlabel. The format of the public DNS name of the VM looks like:

> `<custom domainlabel`>.`<azure region`>.cloudapp.azure.com
> 
> 

More details related to the DNS name can be found [here][virtual-machines-azurerm-versus-azuresm].

Setting the SAP profile parameter icm/host_name_full to the DNS name of the Azure VM the link might look similar to:

> https:\//mydomainlabel.westeurope.cloudapp.net:44300/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit
> 
> http:\//mydomainlabel.westeurope.cloudapp.net:8000/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/dba_cockpit

In this case you need to make sure to:

* Add Inbound rules to the Network Security Group in the Azure portal for the TCP/IP ports used to communicate with ICM
* Add Inbound rules to the Windows Firewall configuration for the TCP/IP ports used to communicate with the ICM

To reduce the danger of data loss in case of an error, it is recommended to use a disk where no database directory/file is located.

Besides data- and LOB compression, SAP ASE also offers backup compression. To consume less space with the database and log dumps it is recommended to use backup compression. For more information, see SAP Note [1588316]. Compressing the backup is also crucial to reduce the amount of data to be transferred if you plan to download backups or VHDs containing backup dumps from the Azure Virtual Machine to on-premises.

Do not use the Azure VM temp space /mnt or /mnt/resource as database or log dump destination.

#### Performance Considerations for Backups/Restores
As in bare-metal deployments, backup/restore performance is dependent on how many volumes can be read in parallel and what the throughput of those volumes might be. Keep in mind that backup compression consumes CPU resources. This CPU consumption of backup compression can play a significant role on VMs with small number of CPU threads.  Therefore, you can assume:

* The fewer the number of disks used to store the database devices, the smaller the overall throughput in reading
* The smaller the number of CPU threads in the VM, the more severe the impact of backup compression
* The fewer targets (Linux software RAID, disks) to write the backup to, the lesser the throughput

To increase the number of targets to write to there are two options, which can be used/combined depending on your needs:

* Striping the backup target volume over multiple mounted disks to improve the IOPS throughput on that striped volume
* Creating a dump configuration on SAP ASE level, which uses more than one target directory to write the dump to

Striping a disk volume over multiple mounted disks has been discussed in [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](dbms_guide_general.md). For more information on using multiple directories in the SAP ASE dump configuration, refer to the documentation on Stored Procedure sp_config_dump, which is used to create the dump configuration on the [Sybase Infocenter](http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp).

### Disaster Recovery with Azure VMs
#### Data Replication with SAP Sybase Replication Server
With the SAP Sybase Replication Server (SRS), SAP ASE provides a warm standby solution to transfer database transactions to a distant location asynchronously. 

The installation and operation of SRS works as well functionally in a VM hosted in Azure Virtual Machine Services as it does on-premises.

ASE HADR via SAP Replication Server is supported. It is highly recommended to use SAP ASE 16.03 to attempt such a configuration. More detailed instructions to install such configurations can be found in detail in this [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/saponsqlserver/2018/06/18/installation-procedure-for-sybase-16-3-patch-level-3-always-on-dr-on-suse-12-3-recent-customer-proof-of-concept/).
