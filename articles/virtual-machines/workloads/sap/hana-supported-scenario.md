# Supported scenarios for HANA Large Instances
This document describes the supported scenarios along with their architecture details for the HANA Large Instances (HLI).

>[!NOTE]
>If your required scenario is not mentioned here, contact Microsoft Service Management team to assess your requirements.
Before proceeding with the HLI unit provisioning, validate the design with SAP or your service implementation partner.

## Terms and definitions
Let's understand the terms and definitions used in the document.

- SID: System Identifier for HANA system.
- HLI: Hana Large Instances.
- DR: A disaster recovery site.
- Normal DR: A system setup with a dedicated resource for DR purpose used only.
- Multipurpose DR: A system at DR site configured to use non-production environment along with production instance configured to use to DR event. 
- Single SID:  A system with one instance installed.
- Multi SID: A system with multiple instances configured. Also called an MCOS environment.
- HSR: SAP HANA System Replication.

## Overview
The HANA Large Instances support the variety of architectures to accomplish your business requirements. The following list covers the scenarios and their configuration details. 

The derived architecture design is purely from the infrastructure perspective, and you must consult SAP or your implementation partners for the HANA deployment. If your scenarios are not listed, contact the Microsoft account team to review the architecture and derive a solution for you.

**These architectures are fully compliant with the TDI (Tailored Data Integration) design and supported by SAP.**

This document describes the details of the two components in each supported architecture:

- Ethernet
- Storage

### Ethernet

Each server provisioned comes pre-configured with the sets of ethernet interfaces. Here are the details of the ethernet interfaces configured on each HLI unit.

- **A**: This interface is used for/by the client access.
- **B**: This interface is used for the node to node communication. This interface is configured on all the servers (irrespective of the topology requested) but only used for the 
- scale-out scenarios.
- **C**: This interface is used for the node to the storage connectivity.
- **D**: This interface is used for the Node to ISCSI device connection for STONITH setup. This interface is only configured when the HSR setup is requested.  

| NIC LOGICAL INTERFACES | SKU TYPE | Name with SUSE OS | Name with RHEL OS | Use case|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | TYPE I | eth0.tenant | eno1.tenant | Client to HLI |
| B | TYPE I | eth2.tenant | eno3.tenant | Node to node |
| C | TYPE I | eth1.tenant | eno2.tenant | Node to storage |
| D | TYPE I | eth4.tenant | eno4.tenant | STONITH |
| A | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo> | team0.tenant | Client to HLI |
| B | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+2> | team0.tenant+2 | Node to node |
| C | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+1> | team0.tenant+1 | Node to storage |
| D | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+3> | team0.tenant+3 | STONITH |

You use the interfaces based on the topology configured on the HLI unit. For example, the interface “B” is set up for node to node communication, which is useful when you have a scale-out topology configured. In the case of single node scale-up configuration, this interface is not used. Review your required scenarios (later in this document) to get more information about the interface usage. 

If needed, you can define additional NIC cards on your own. However, the configuration on the existing NICs can NOT be changed.

>[!NOTE]
>You may still find additional interfaces which are physical interfaces or bonding. 
You should consider the above-mentioned interfaces for your used case, rest can be ignored/or not to be tempered with.

The distribution for units with two IP addresses assigned should look like:

- Ethernet “A” should have an IP address assigned that is out of the Server IP Pool address range that you submitted to Microsoft. This IP address shall be used for maintaining in /etc/hosts of the OS.

- Ethernet “C” should have an IP address assigned that is used for communication to NFS. Therefore, these addresses do **NOT** need to be maintained in etc/hosts in order to allow instance to instance traffic within the tenant.

For deployment cases of HANA System Replication or HANA scale-out, a blade configuration with two IP addresses assigned is not suitable. If having two IP addresses assigned only and wanting to deploy such a configuration, contact SAP HANA on Azure Service Management to get a third IP address in a third VLAN assigned. For HANA Large Instance units having three IP addresses assigned on three NIC ports, the following usage rules apply:

- Ethernet “A” should have an IP address assigned that is out of the Server IP Pool address range that you submitted to Microsoft. Hence this IP address shall not be used for maintaining in /etc/hosts of the OS.

- Ethernet “B” should be exclusively used to be maintained in etc/hosts for communication between the different instances. These addresses would also be the IP addresses that need to be maintained in scale-out HANA configurations as IP addresses HANA uses for the inter-node configuration.

- Ethernet “C” should have an IP address assigned that is used for communication to NFS storage. Hence this type of addresses should not be maintained in etc/hosts.

- Ethernet “D” should be exclusively used for access STONITH device for pacemaker. This interface is required when you configure HANA System Replication (HSR) and want to achieve auto failover at the operating system using an SBD based device.


### Storage
Storage is preconfigured based on the topology requested. The volume sizes and mountpoint vary based on the number of servers, SKUs, and topology configured. Review your required scenarios (later in this document) to get more information. If more storage is required, you can purchase it in one TB increment.

>[!NOTE]
>The mountpoint /usr/sap/\<SID> is a symbolic link to the /hana/shared mountpoint.

| B | TYPE I | eth2.tenant | eno3.tenant | Node to node communication |
| C | TYPE I | eth1.tenant | eno2.tenant | Node to storage |
| D | TYPE I | eth4.tenant | eno4.tenant | Configured but not in use |

| B | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+2> | team0.tenant+2 | Node to node communication |
| C | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+1> | team0.tenant+1 | Node to storage |
| D | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+3> | team0.tenant+3 | Configured but not in use |

### Storage
The following mountpoints are preconfigured:

| Mountpoint | Use case | 
| --- | --- |
|**On the primary node**|
|/hana/shared | HANA Install for production SID | 
|/hana/data/SID/mnt00001 | Data files install for production SID | 
|/hana/log/SID/mnt00001 | Log files install for production SID | 
|/hana/logbackups/SID | Redo logs for production SID |
|**On the DR node**|

|/hana/data/SID/mnt00001 | Data files install for production SID | 
|/hana/log/SID/mnt00001 | Log files install for production SID | 


### Key considerations
- /usr/sap/SID is a symbolic link to /hana/shared/SID.
-  At the DR: The volumes and mountpoints are configured (marked as “Required for HANA installation”) for the production HANA Instance installation at the DR HLI unit. 
- At the DR: The data, logbackups, and shared volumes (marked as “Storage Replication”) are replicated via snapshot from the production site. These volumes are mounted during the failover time only. For more information, read the document [Disaster recovery failover procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-high-availability-disaster-recovery) for more details. 
- Boot volume for **SKU Type I class** is replicated to DR node.


## 11. Single node with DR using HSR
 
This topology supports one node in a scale up configuration with one SID with the HANA system replication to the DR site for a primary SID. In the diagram, only single SID is depicted at the primary site, but multisid (MCOS) is supported as well.

- Primary node get sync to DR node using HANA system replication. 
- [Global Reach](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach) is used to link the ExpressRoute circuits together to make a private network between your regions network.



## 12. Single node HSR to DR (cost optimized) 
 
 This topology supports one node in a scale up configuration with one SID with the HANA system replication to the DR site for a primary SID. In the diagram, only single SID is depicted at the primary site, but multisid (MCOS) is supported as well. At the DR site, HLI unit is used for QA instance while production operations are running from the primary site. At the time of DR failover (or failover test), QA instance at DR site is taken down.
