# Using SAP on Linux virtual machines in Azure
Cloud Computing is a widely used term which is gaining more and more importance within the IT industry, from small companies up to large and multinational corporations. Microsoft Azure is the Cloud Services Platform from Microsoft which offers a wide spectrum of new possibilities. Now customers are able to rapidly provision and de-provision applications as Cloud-Services, so they are not limited to technical or budgeting restrictions. Instead of investing time and budget into hardware infrastructure, companies can focus on the application, business processes and its benefits for customers and users.

With Microsoft Azure virtual machines, Microsoft offers a comprehensive Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. SAP NetWeaver based applications are supported on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS). The whitepapers below describe how to plan and implement SAP NetWeaver based applications on Windows virtual machines in Azure. You can also implement SAP NetWeaver based applications on [Windows virtual machines](./get-started.md?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/classic/toc.json).

## SAP NetWeaver on Azure SUSE Linux Virtual Machines
Title: Testing SAP NetWeaver on Microsoft Azure SUSE Linux VMs

Summary: There is no official SAP support for running SAP NetWeaver on Azure Linux VMs at this point in time. Nevertheless customers
might want to do some testing or might consider to run SAP demo or training systems on Azure Linux VMs as long as there is no need for contacting SAP support. 
This article should help setting up Azure SUSE Linux VMs for running SAP and gives some basic hints in order to avoid common potential pitfalls.
