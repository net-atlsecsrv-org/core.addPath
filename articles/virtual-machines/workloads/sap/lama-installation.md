> [!NOTE]
> General Support Statement: Please always open an incident with SAP on component BC-VCM-LVM-HYPERV if you need support for SAP LaMa or the Azure connector.

SAP LaMa is used by many customers to operate and monitor their SAP landscape. Since SAP LaMa 3.0 SP05, it ships with a connector to Azure by default. You can use this connector to deallocate and start virtual machines, copy and relocate managed disks, and delete managed disks. With these basic operations, you can relocate, copy, clone, and refresh SAP systems using SAP LaMa.

This guide describes how you set up the Azure connector for SAP LaMa, create virtual machines that can be used to install adaptive SAP systems and how to configure them.

> [!NOTE]
> The connector is only available in the SAP LaMa Enterprise Edition

## Resources

The following SAP Notes are related to the topic of SAP LaMa on Azure:

| Note number | Title |
| --- | --- |
| [2343511] |Microsoft Azure connector for SAP Landscape Management (LaMa) |
| [2350235] |SAP Landscape Management 3.0 - Enterprise edition |

Also read the [SAP Help Portal for SAP LaMa](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_LANDSCAPE_MANAGEMENT_ENTERPRISE).

## General remarks

* Make sure to enable *Automatic Mountpoint Creation* in Setup -> Settings -> Engine  
  If SAP LaMa mounts volumes using the SAP Adaptive Extensions on a virtual machine, the mount point must exist if this setting is not enabled.

* Use separate subnet and don't use dynamic IP addresses to prevent IP address "stealing" when deploying new VMs and SAP instances are unprepared  
  If you use dynamic IP address allocation in the subnet, which is also used by SAP LaMa, preparing an SAP system with SAP LaMa might fail. If an SAP system is unprepared, the IP addresses are not reserved and might get allocated to other virtual machines.

* If you sign in to managed hosts, make sure to not block file systems from being unmounted  
  If you sign in to a Linux virtual machines and change the working directory to a directory in a mount point, for example /usr/sap/AH1/ASCS00/exe, the volume cannot be unmounted and a relocate or unprepare fails.

* Make sure to disable CLOUD_NETCONFIG_MANAGE on SUSE SLES Linux virtual machines. For more details, see [SUSE KB 7023633](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7023633).

## Set up Azure connector for SAP LaMa

The Azure connector is shipped as of SAP LaMa 3.0 SP05. We recommend always installing the latest support package and patch for SAP LaMa 3.0.

The Azure connector uses the Azure Resource Manager API to manage your Azure resources. SAP LaMa can use a Service Principal or a Managed Identity to authenticate against this API. If your SAP LaMa is running on an Azure VM, we recommend using a Managed Identity as described in chapter [Use a Managed Identity to get access to the Azure API](lama-installation.md#af65832e-6469-4d69-9db5-0ed09eac126d). If you want to use a Service Principal, follow the steps in chapter [Use a Service Principal to get access to the Azure API](lama-installation.md#913c222a-3754-487f-9c89-983c82da641e).

### <a name="913c222a-3754-487f-9c89-983c82da641e"></a>Use a Service Principal to get access to the Azure API

The Azure connector can use a Service Principal to authorize against Microsoft Azure. Follow these steps to create a Service Principal for SAP Landscape Management (LaMa).

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
1. Open the Azure Active Directory blade
1. Click on App registrations
1. Click on New registration
1. Enter a name and click on Register
1. Select the new App and click on Certificates & secrets in the Settings tab
1. Create a new client secret, enter a description for a new key, select when the secret should expire and click on Save
1. Write down the Value. It is used as the password for the Service Principal
1. Write down the Application ID. It is used as the username of the Service Principal

The Service Principal does not have permissions to access your Azure resources by default. You need to give the Service Principal permissions to access them.

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
1. Open the Resource groups blade
1. Select the resource group you want to use
1. Click Access control (IAM)
1. Click on Add role assignment
1. Select the role Contributor
1. Enter the name of the application you created above
1. Click Save
1. Repeat step 3 to 8 for all resource groups you want to use in SAP LaMa

### <a name="af65832e-6469-4d69-9db5-0ed09eac126d"></a>Use a Managed Identity to get access to the Azure API

To be able to use a Managed Identity, your SAP LaMa instance has to run on an Azure VM that has a system or user assigned identity. For more information about Managed Identities, read [What is managed identities for Azure resources?](../../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) and [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a VM using the Azure portal](../../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md).

The Managed Identity does not have permissions to access your Azure resources by default. You need to give it permissions to access them.

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
1. Open the Resource groups blade
1. Select the resource group you want to use
1. Click Access control (IAM)
1. Click on Add -> Add Role assignment
1. Select the role Contributor
1. Select 'Virtual Machine' for 'Assign access to'
1. Select the virtual machine where your SAP LaMa instance is running on
1. Click Save
1. Repeat the steps for all resource groups you want to use in SAP LaMa

In your SAP LaMa Azure connector configuration, select 'Use Managed Identity' to enable the usage of the Managed Identity. If you want to use a system assigned identity, make sure to leave the User Name field empty. If you want to use a user assigned identity, enter the user assigned identity Id into the User Name field.

### Create a new connector in SAP LaMa

Open the SAP LaMa website and navigate to Infrastructure. Go to tab Cloud Managers and click on Add. Select the Microsoft Azure Cloud Adapter and click Next. Enter the following information:

* Label: Choose a name for the connector instance
* User Name: Service Principal Application ID or ID of the user assigned identity of the virtual machine. See [Using a System or User Assigned Identity] for more information
* Password: Service Principal key/password. You can leave this field empty if you use a system or user assigned identity.
* URL: Keep default `https://management.azure.com/`
* Monitoring Interval (Seconds): Should be at least 300
* Use Managed Identity: SAP LaMa can use a system or user assigned identity to authenticate against the Azure API. See chapter [Use a Managed Identity to get access to the Azure API](lama-installation.md#af65832e-6469-4d69-9db5-0ed09eac126d) in this guide.
* Subscription ID: Azure subscription ID
* Azure Active Directory Tenant ID: ID of the Active Directory tenant
* Proxy host: Hostname of the proxy if SAP LaMa needs a proxy to connect to the internet
* Proxy port: TCP port of the proxy
* Change Storage Type to save costs: Enable this setting if the Azure Adapter should change the storage type of the Managed Disks to save costs when the disks are not in use. For data disks that are referenced in an SAP instance configuration, the adapter will change the disk type to Standard Storage during an instance unprepare and back to the original storage type during an instance prepare. If you stop a virtual machine in SAP LaMa, the adapter will change the storage type of all attached disks, including the OS disk to Standard Storage. If you start a virtual machine in SAP LaMa, the adapter will change the storage type back to the original storage type.

Click on Test Configuration to validate your input. You should see

Connection successful: Connection to Microsoft cloud was successful. 7 resource groups found (only 10 groups requested)

at the bottom of the website.

## Provision a new adaptive SAP system

You can manually deploy a new virtual machine or use one of the Azure templates in the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates). It contains templates for [SAP NetWeaver ASCS](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sap-lama-ascs), [SAP NetWeaver application servers](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sap-lama-apps), and the [database](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sap-lama-database). You can also use these templates to provision new hosts as part of a system copy/clone etc.

We recommend using a separate subnet for all virtual machines that you want to manage with SAP LaMa and donâ€™t use dynamic IP addresses to prevent IP address "stealing" when deploying new virtual machines and SAP instances are unprepared.

> [!NOTE]
> If possible, remove all virtual machine extensions as they might cause long runtimes for detaching disks from a virtual machine.

Make sure that user \<hanasid>adm, \<sapsid>adm and group sapsys exist on the target machine with the same ID and gid or use LDAP. Enable and start the NFS server on the virtual machines that should be used to run the SAP NetWeaver (A)SCS.

### Manual Deployment

SAP LaMa communicates with the virtual machine using the SAP Host Agent. If you deploy the virtual machines manually or not using the Azure Resource Manager template from the quickstart repository, make sure to install the latest SAP Host Agent and the SAP Adaptive Extensions. For more information about the required patch levels for Azure, see SAP Note [2343511].

#### Manual deployment of a Linux Virtual Machine

Create a new virtual machine with one of the supported operation systems listed in SAP Note [2343511]. Add additional IP configurations for the SAP instances. Each instance needs at least on IP address and must be installed using a virtual hostname.

The SAP NetWeaver ASCS instance needs disks for /sapmnt/\<SAPSID>, /usr/sap/\<SAPSID>, /usr/sap/trans, and /usr/sap/\<sapsid>adm. The SAP NetWeaver application servers do not need additional disks. Everything related to the SAP instance must be stored on the ASCS and exported via NFS. Otherwise, it is currently not possible to add additional application servers using SAP LaMa.

![SAP NetWeaver ASCS on Linux](media/lama/sap-lama-ascs-app-linux.png)

#### Manual deployment for SAP HANA

Create a new virtual machine with one of the supported operation systems for SAP HANA as listed in SAP Note [2343511]. Add one additional IP configuration for SAP HANA and one per HANA tenant.

SAP HANA needs disks for /hana/shared, /hana/backup, /hana/data, and /hana/log

![SAP HANA on Linux](media/lama/sap-lama-db-hana.png)

#### Manual deployment for Oracle Database on Linux

Create a new virtual machine with one of the supported operation systems for Oracle databases as listed in SAP Note [2343511]. Add one additional IP configuration for the Oracle database.

The Oracle database needs disks for /oracle, /home/oraod1, and /home/oracle

![Oracle database on Linux](media/lama/sap-lama-db-ora-lnx.png)

#### Manual deployment for Microsoft SQL Server

Create a new virtual machine with one of the supported operation systems for Microsoft SQL Server as listed in SAP Note [2343511]. Add one additional IP configuration for the SQL Server instance.

The SQL Server database server needs disks for the database data and log files and disks for c:\usr\sap.

![Oracle database on Linux](media/lama/sap-lama-db-sql.png)

Make sure to install a supported Microsoft ODBC driver for SQL Server on a virtual machine that you want to use to relocate an SAP NetWeaver application server to or as a system copy/clone target.

SAP LaMa cannot relocate SQL Server itself so a virtual machine that you want to use to relocate a database instance to or as a system copy/clone target needs SQL Server preinstalled.

### Deploy Virtual Machine Using an Azure Template

Download the following latest available archives from the [SAP Software Marketplace](https://support.sap.com/swdc) for the operating system of the virtual machines:

1. SAPCAR 7.21
1. SAP HOST AGENT 7.21
1. SAP ADAPTIVE EXTENSION 1.0 EXT

Also download the following components from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download)

1. Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64) (Windows only)
1. Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server (SQL Server only)

The components are required to deploy the template. The easiest way to make them available to the template is to upload them to an Azure storage account and create a Shared Access Signature (SAS).

The templates have the following parameters:

* sapSystemId: The SAP system ID. It is used to create the disk layout (for example /usr/sap/\<sapsid>).

* computerName: The computer name of the new virtual machine. This parameter is also used by SAP LaMa. When you use this template to provision a new virtual machine as part of a system copy, SAP LaMa waits until the host with this computer name can be reached.

* osType: The type of the operating system you want to deploy.

* dbtype: The type of the database. This parameter is used to determine how many additional IP configurations need to be added and how the disk layout should look like.

* sapSystemSize: The size of the SAP System you want to deploy. It is used to determine the virtual machine instance type and size.

* adminUsername: Username for the virtual machine.

* adminPassword: Password for the virtual machine. You can also provide a public key for SSH.

* sshKeyData: Public SSH key for the virtual machines. Only supported for Linux operating systems.

* subnetId: The ID of the subnet you want to use.

* deployEmptyTarget: You can deploy an empty target if you want to use the virtual machine as a target for an instance relocate or similar. In this case, no additional disks or IP configurations are attached.

* sapcarLocation: The location for the sapcar application that matches the operating system you deploy. sapcar is used to extract the archives you provide in other parameters.

* sapHostAgentArchiveLocation: The location of the SAP Host Agent archive. SAP Host Agent is deployed as part of this template deployment.

* sapacExtLocation: The location of the SAP Adaptive Extensions. SAP Note [2343511] lists the minimum patch level required for Azure.

* vcRedistLocation: The location of the VC Runtime that is required to install the SAP Adaptive Extensions. This parameter is only required for Windows.

* odbcDriverLocation: The location of the ODBC driver you want to install. Only Microsoft ODBC driver for SQL Server is supported.

* sapadmPassword: The password for the sapadm user.

* sapadmId: The Linux User ID of the sapadm user. Not required for Windows.

* sapsysGid: The Linux group ID of the sapsys group. Not required for Windows.

* _artifactsLocation: The base URI, where artifacts required by this template are located. When the template is deployed using the accompanying scripts, a private location in the subscription will be used and this value will be automatically generated. Only needed if you do not deploy the template from GitHub.

* _artifactsLocationSasToken: The sasToken required to access _artifactsLocation. When the template is deployed using the accompanying scripts, a sasToken will be automatically generated. Only needed if you do not deploy the template from GitHub.

### SAP HANA

In the examples below, we assume that you install SAP HANA with system ID HN1 and the SAP NetWeaver system with system ID AH1. The virtual hostnames are hn1-db for the HANA instance, ah1-db for the HANA tenant used by the SAP NetWeaver system, ah1-ascs for the SAP NetWeaver ASCS and ah1-di-0 for the first SAP NetWeaver application server.

#### Install SAP NetWeaver ASCS for SAP HANA using Azure Managed Disks

Before you start the SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM), you need to mount the IP address of virtual hostname of the ASCS. The recommended way is to use sapacext. If you mount the IP address using sapacext, make sure to remount the IP address after a reboot.

![Linux][Logo_Linux] Linux

```bash
# /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i eth0 -h ah1-ascs -n 255.255.255.128
```

![Windows][Logo_Windows] Windows

```bash
# C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i "Ethernet 3" -h ah1-ascs -n 255.255.255.128
```

Run SWPM and use *ah1-ascs* for the *ASCS Instance Host Name*.

![Linux][Logo_Linux] Linux  
Add the following profile parameter to the SAP Host Agent profile, which is located at /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/host_profile. For more information, see SAP Note [2628497].
```
acosprep/nfs_paths=/home/ah1adm,/usr/sap/trans,/sapmnt/AH1,/usr/sap/AH1
```

#### Install SAP NetWeaver ASCS for SAP HANA on Azure NetAppFiles (ANF) BETA

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is nor GA yet. For more information refer to SAP Note [2815988] (only visible to preview customers).
Open an SAP incident on component BC-VCM-LVM-HYPERV and request to join the LaMa storage adapter for Azure NetApp Files preview

ANF provides NFS for Azure. In the context of SAP LaMa this simplifies the creation of the ABAP Central Services (ASCS) instances and the subsequent installation of application servers. Previously the ASCS instance had to act as NFS server as well and the parameter acosprep/nfs_paths had to be added to the host_profile of the SAP Hostagent.

#### ANF is currently available in these regions:

Australia East, Central US, East US, East US 2, North Europe, South Central US, West Europe and West US 2.

#### Network Requirements

ANF requires a delegated subnet which must be part of the same VNET as the SAP servers. Hereâ€™s an example for such a configuration.
This screen shows the creation of the VNET and the first subnet:

![SAP LaMa create virtual network for Azure ANF ](media/lama/sap-lama-createvn-50.png)

The next step creates the delegated subnet for Microsoft.NetApp/volumes.

![SAP LaMa add delegated subnet ](media/lama/sap-lama-addsubnet-50.png)

![SAP LaMa list of subnets ](media/lama/sap-lama-subnets.png)

Now a NetApp account needs to be created within the Azure portal:

![SAP LaMa create NetApp account ](media/lama/sap-lama-create-netappaccount-50.png)

![SAP LaMa NetApp account created ](media/lama/sap-lama-netappaccount.png)

Within the NetApp account the capacity pool specifies the size and type of disks for each pool:

![SAP LaMa create NetApp capacity pool ](media/lama/sap-lama-capacitypool-50.png)

![SAP LaMa NetApp capacity pool created ](media/lama/sap-lama-capacitypool-list.png)

The NFS volumes can now be defined. Since there will be volumes for multiple systems in one pool, a self-explaining naming scheme should be chosen. Adding the SID helps to group related volumes together. For the ASCS and the AS instance the following mounts are needed: */sapmnt/\<SID\>*, */usr/sap/\<SID\>*, and */home/\<sid\>adm*. Optionally, */usr/sap/trans* is needed for the central transport directory, which is at least used by all systems of one landscape.

> [!NOTE]
> During the BETA phase the name of the volumes must be unique within the subscription.

![SAP LaMa create a volume 1 ](media/lama/sap-lama-createvolume-80.png)

![SAP LaMa create a volume 2 ](media/lama/sap-lama-createvolume2-80.png)

![SAP LaMa create a volume 3 ](media/lama/sap-lama-createvolume3-80.png)

These steps need to be repeated for the other volumes as well.

![SAP LaMa list of created volumes ](media/lama/sap-lama-volumes.png)

Now these volumes need to be mounted to the systems where the initial installation with the SAP SWPM will be performed.

First the mount points need to be created. In this case the SID is AN1 so the following commands need to be executed:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/an1adm
mkdir -p /sapmnt/AN1
mkdir -p /usr/sap/AN1
mkdir -p /usr/sap/trans
```
Next the ANF volumes will be mounted with the following commands:

```bash
# sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,hard,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,vers=3,tcp 9.9.9.132:/an1-home-sidadm /home/an1adm
# sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,hard,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,vers=3,tcp 9.9.9.132:/an1-sapmnt-sid /sapmnt/AN1
# sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,hard,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,vers=3,tcp 9.9.9.132:/an1-usr-sap-sid /usr/sap/AN1
# sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,hard,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,vers=3,tcp 9.9.9.132:/global-usr-sap-trans /usr/sap/trans
```
The mount commands can also be derived from the portal. The local mount points need to adjusted.

Use the df -h command to verify.

![SAP LaMa mount points OS level ](media/lama/sap-lama-mounts.png)

Now the installation with SWPM must be performed.

The same steps must be performed for at least one AS instance.

After the successful installation the system must be discovered within SAP LaMa.

The mount points should look like this for the ASCS and the AS instance:

![SAP LaMa mount points in LaMa ](media/lama/sap-lama-ascs.png)
(This is an example. The IP addresses and export path are different from the ones used before)


#### Install SAP HANA

If you install SAP HANA using the commandline tool hdblcm, use parameter --hostname to provide a virtual hostname. You need to add the IP address of the virtual hostname of the database to a network interface. The recommended way is to use sapacext. If you mount the IP address using sapacext, make sure to remount the IP address after a reboot.

Add another virtual hostname and IP address for the name that is used by the application servers to connect to the HANA tenant.

```bash
# /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i eth0 -h hn1-db -n 255.255.255.128
/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i eth0 -h ah1-db -n 255.255.255.128
```

Run the database instance installation of SWPM on the application server virtual machine, not on the HANA virtual machine. Use *ah1-db* for the *Database Host* in dialog *Database for SAP System*.

#### Install SAP NetWeaver Application Server for SAP HANA

Before you start the SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM), you need to mount the IP address of virtual hostname of the application server. The recommended way is to use sapacext. If you mount the IP address using sapacext, make sure to remount the IP address after a reboot.

![Linux][Logo_Linux] Linux

```bash
# /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapacext -a ifup -i eth0 -h ah1-di-0 -n 255.255.255.128
```

![Windows][Logo_Windows] Windows

```bash
# C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i "Ethernet 3" -h ah1-di-0 -n 255.255.255.128
```

It is recommended to use SAP NetWeaver profile parameter dbs/hdb/hdb_use_ident to set the identity that is used to find the key in the HDB userstore. You can add this parameter manually after the database instance installation with SWPM or run SWPM with

```bash
# from https://blogs.sap.com/2015/04/14/sap-hana-client-software-different-ways-to-set-the-connectivity-data/
/sapdb/DVDs/IM_LINUX_X86_64/sapinst HDB_USE_IDENT=SYSTEM_COO
```

If you set it manually, you also need to create new HDB userstore entries.

```bash
# run as <sapsid>adm
/usr/sap/AH1/hdbclient/hdbuserstore LIST
# reuse the port that was listed from the command above, in this example 35041
/usr/sap/AH1/hdbclient/hdbuserstore SET DEFAULT ah1-db:35041@AH1 SAPABAP1 <password>
```

Use *ah1-di-0* for the *PAS Instance Host Name* in dialog *Primary Application Server Instance*.

#### Post-Installation Steps for SAP HANA

Make sure to back up the SYSTEMDB and all tenant databases before you try to do a tenant copy, tenant move or create a system replication.

### Microsoft SQL Server

In the examples below, we assume that you install the SAP NetWeaver system with system ID AS1. The virtual hostnames are as1-db for the SQL Server instance used by the SAP NetWeaver system, as1-ascs for the SAP NetWeaver ASCS and as1-di-0 for the first SAP NetWeaver application server.

#### Install SAP NetWeaver ASCS for SQL Server

Before you start the SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM), you need to mount the IP address of virtual hostname of the ASCS. The recommended way is to use sapacext. If you mount the IP address using sapacext, make sure to remount the IP address after a reboot.

```bash
# C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i "Ethernet 3" -h as1-ascs -n 255.255.255.128
```

Run SWPM and use *as1-ascs* for the *ASCS Instance Host Name*.

#### Install SQL Server

You need to add the IP address of the virtual hostname of the database to a network interface. The recommended way is to use sapacext. If you mount the IP address using sapacext, make sure to remount the IP address after a reboot.

```bash
# C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i "Ethernet 3" -h as1-db -n 255.255.255.128
```

Run the database instance installation of SWPM on the SQL server virtual machine. Use SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=*as1-db* to override the hostname used to connect to SQL Server. If you deployed the virtual machine using the Azure Resource Manager template, make sure to set the directory used for the database data files to *C:\sql\data* and database log file to *C:\sql\log*.

Make sure that the user *NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM* has access to the SQL Server and has the server role *sysadmin*. For more information, see SAP Note [1877727] and [2562184].

#### Install SAP NetWeaver Application Server

Before you start the SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM), you need to mount the IP address of virtual hostname of the application server. The recommended way is to use sapacext. If you mount the IP address using sapacext, make sure to remount the IP address after a reboot.

```bash
# C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i <network interface> -h <virtual hostname or IP address> -n <subnet mask>
C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\sapacext.exe -a ifup -i "Ethernet 3" -h as1-di-0 -n 255.255.255.128
```

Use *as1-di-0* for the *PAS Instance Host Name* in dialog *Primary Application Server Instance*.
