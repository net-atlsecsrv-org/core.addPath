# High availability set up in SUSE using the STONITH
This document provides the detailed step by step instructions to set up the High Availability on SUSE Operating system using the STONITH device.

**Disclaimer:** *This guide is derived by testing the setup in the Microsoft HANA Large Instances environment, which successfully works. As Microsoft Service Management team for HANA Large Instances does not support Operating system, you may need to contact SUSE for any further troubleshooting or clarification on the operating system layer. Microsoft service management team does set up STONITH device and fully supports and can be involved for troubleshooting for STONITH device issues.*
## Overview
To set up the High availability using SUSE clustering, the following pre-requisites must meet.
### Pre-requisites
- HANA Large Instances are provisioned
- Operating system is registered
- HANA Large Instances servers are connected to SMT server to get patches/packages
- Operating system have latest patches installed
- NTP (time server) is set up
- Read and understand the latest version of SUSE documentation on HA setup

### Setup details
This guide uses the following setup:
- Operating System: SLES 12 SP1 for SAP
- HANA Large Instances: 2xS192 (four sockets, 2 TB)
- HANA Version: HANA 2.0 SP1
- Server Names: sapprdhdb95 (node1) and sapprdhdb96 (node2)
- STONITH Device: iSCSI based STONITH device
- NTP set up on one of the HANA Large Instance nodes

When you set up HANA Large Instances with HSR, you can request Microsoft Service Management team to set up STONITH. If you are already an existing customer who has HANA Large Instances provisioned, and need STONITH device set up for your existing blades, you need to provide the following information to Microsoft Service Management team in the service request form (SRF). You can request SRF form through the Technical Account Manager or your Microsoft Contact for HANA Large Instance onboarding. The new customers can request STONITH device at the time of provisioning. The inputs are available in the provisioning request form.

- Server Name and Server IP address (for example, myhanaserver1, 10.35.0.1)
- Location (for example, US East)
- Customer Name (for example, Microsoft)
- SID - HANA System Identifier (for example, H11)

Once the STONITH device is configured, Microsoft Service Management team does provide you the SBD device name and IP address of the iSCSI storage, which you can use to configure STONITH setup. 

To set up the end to end HA using STONITH, the following steps needs to be followed:

1.	Identify the SBD device
2.	Initialize the SBD device
3.	Configuring the Cluster
4.	Setting Up the Softdog Watchdog
5.	Join the node to the cluster
6.	Validate the cluster
7.	Configure the resources to the cluster
8.	Test the failover process

## 1.	Identify the SBD device
This section describes on how to determine the SBD device for your setup after Microsoft service management team has configured the STONITH. **This section only applies to the existing customer**. If you are a new customer, Microsoft service management team does provide SBD device name to you and you can skip this section.

1.1	Modify */etc/iscsi/initiatorname.isci* to 
``` 
iqn.1996-04.de.suse:01:<Tenant><Location><SID><NodeNumber> 
```

Microsoft service management does provide this string. Modify the file on **both** the nodes, however the node number is different on each node.

![Screenshot shows an initiatorname file with InitiatorName values for a node.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/initiatorname.png)

1.2 Modify */etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf*: Set *node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout=5* and *node.startup = automatic*. Modify the file on **both** the nodes.

1.3	Execute the discovery command, it shows four sessions. Run it on both the nodes.

```
iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p <IP address provided by Service Management>:3260
```

![Screenshot shows a console window with results of the isciadm discovery command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/iSCSIadmDiscovery.png)

1.4	Execute the command to log in to the iSCSI device, it shows four sessions. Run it on **both** the nodes.

```
iscsiadm -m node -l
```
![Screenshot shows a console window with results of the iscsiadm node command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/iSCSIadmLogin.png)

1.5 Execute the rescan script: *rescan-scsi-bus.sh*.  This script shows you the new disks created for you.  Run it on both the nodes. You should see a LUN number that is greater than zero (for example: 1, 2 etc.)

```
rescan-scsi-bus.sh
```
![Screenshot shows a console window with results of the script.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/rescanscsibus.png)

1.6	To get the device name run the command *fdisk –l*. Run it on both the nodes. Pick the device with the size of **178 MiB**.

```
  fdisk –l
```

![Screenshot shows a console window with results of the f disk command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/fdisk-l.png)

## 2.	Initialize the SBD device

2.1	Initialize the SBD device on **both** the nodes

```
sbd -d <SBD Device Name> create
```
![Screenshot shows a console window with the result of the s b d create command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/sbdcreate.png)

2.2	Check what has been written to the device. Do it on **both** the nodes

```
sbd -d <SBD Device Name> dump
```

## 3.	Configuring the Cluster
This section describes the steps to set up the SUSE HA cluster.
### 3.1	Package installation
3.1.1	Please check that ha_sles and SAPHanaSR-doc patterns are installed. If it is not installed, install them. Install it on **both** the nodes.
```
zypper in -t pattern ha_sles
zypper in SAPHanaSR SAPHanaSR-doc
```
![Screenshot shows a console window with the result of the pattern command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/zypperpatternha_sles.png)
![Screenshot shows a console window with the result of the SAPHanaSR-doc command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/zypperpatternSAPHANASR-doc.png)

### 3.2	Setting up the cluster
3.2.1	You can either use *ha-cluster-init* command, or use the yast2 wizard to set up the cluster. In this case, the yast2 wizard is used. You perform this step **only on the Primary node**.

Follow yast2> High Availability > Cluster 
![Screenshot shows the YaST Control Center with High Availability and Cluster selected.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-control-center.png)
![Screenshot shows a dialog box with Install and Cancel options.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-hawk-install.png)

Click **cancel** since the halk2 package is already installed.

![Screenshot shows a message about your cancel option.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-hawk-continue.png)

Click **Continue**

Expected value=Number of nodes deployed (in this case 2)
![Screenshot shows Cluster Security with an Enable Security Auth check box.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-Cluster-Security.png)
Click **Next**
![Screenshot shows Cluster Configure window with Sync Host and Sync File lists.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-cluster-configure-csync2.png)
Add node names and then click “Add suggested files”

Click “Turn csync2 ON”

Click “Generate Pre-Shared-Keys”, it shows below popup

![Screenshot shows a message that your key has been generated.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-key-file.png)

Click **OK**

The authentication is performed using the IP addresses and pre-shared-keys in Csync2. The key file is generated with csync2 -k /etc/csync2/key_hagroup. The file key_hagroup should be copied to all members of the cluster manually after it's created. **Ensure to copy the file from node 1 to node2**.

![Screenshot shows a Cluster Configure dialog box with options necessary to copy the key to all members of the cluster.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-cluster-conntrackd.png)

Click **Next**
![Screenshot shows the Cluster Service window.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/yast-cluster-service.png)

In the default option, Booting was off, change it to “on” so pacemaker is started on boot. You can make the choice based on your setup requirements.
Click **Next** and the cluster configuration is complete.

## 4.	Setting Up the Softdog Watchdog
This section describes the configuration of the watchdog (softdog).

4.1	Add the following line to */etc/init.d/boot.local* on **both** the nodes.
```
modprobe softdog
```
![Screenshot shows a boot file with the softdog line added.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/modprobe-softdog.png)

4.2	Update the file */etc/sysconfig/sbd* on **both** the nodes as following:
```
SBD_DEVICE="<SBD Device Name>"
```
![Screenshot shows the s b d file with the S B D_DEVICE value added.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/sbd-device.png)

4.3	Load the kernel module on **both** the nodes by running the following command
```
modprobe softdog
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window with the command modprobe softdog.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/modprobe-softdog-command.png)

4.4	Check and ensure that softdog is running as following on **both** the nodes:
```
lsmod | grep dog
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window with the result of running the l s mod command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/lsmod-grep-dog.png)

4.5	Start the SBD device on **both** the nodes
```
/usr/share/sbd/sbd.sh start
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window with the start command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/sbd-sh-start.png)

4.6	Test the SBD daemon on **both** the nodes. You see two entries after you configure it on **both** the nodes
```
sbd -d <SBD Device Name> list
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window displaying two entries.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/sbd-list.png)

4.7	Send a test message to **one** of your nodes
```
sbd  -d <SBD Device Name> message <node2> <message>
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window displaying two entries.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/sbd-list.png)

4.8	On the **Second** node (node2) you can check the message status
```
sbd  -d <SBD Device Name> list
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window with one of the members displaying a test value for the other member.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/sbd-list-message.png)

4.9	To adopt the sbd config, update the file */etc/sysconfig/sbd* as following. Update the file on **both** the nodes
```
SBD_DEVICE=" <SBD Device Name>" 
SBD_WATCHDOG="yes" 
SBD_PACEMAKER="yes" 
SBD_STARTMODE="clean" 
SBD_OPTS=""
```
4.10	Start the pacemaker service on the **Primary node** (node1)
```
systemctl start pacemaker
```
![Screenshot shows a console window displaying the status after starting pacemaker.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/start-pacemaker.png)

If the pacemaker service *fails*, refer to *Scenario 5: Pacemaker service fails*

## 5.	Joining the cluster
This section describes on how to join the node to the cluster.

### 5.1	Add the node
Run the following command on **node2** to let node2 join the cluster.
```
ha-cluster-join
```
If you receive an *error* during joining the cluster, refer *Scenario 6: Node 2 unable to join the cluster*.

## 6.	Validating the cluster

### 6.1 Start the cluster service
To check and optionally start the cluster for the first time on **both** nodes.
```
systemctl status pacemaker
systemctl start pacemaker
```
![Screenshot shows a console window with the status of pacemaker.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/systemctl-status-pacemaker.png)
### 6.2 Monitor the status
Run the command *crm_mon* to ensure **both** the nodes are online. You can run it on **any of the nodes** of the cluster
```
crm_mon
```
![Screenshot shows a console window with the results of c r m_mon.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/crm-mon.png)
You can also log in to hawk to check the cluster status *https://\<node IP>:7630*. The default user is hacluster and the password is linux. If needed, you can change the password using *passwd* command.

## 7. Configure Cluster Properties and Resources 
This section describes the steps to configure the cluster resources.
In this example, set up the following resource, the rest can be configured (if needed) by referencing the SUSE HA guide. Perform the config in **one of the nodes** only. Do on primary node.

- Cluster bootstrap
- STONITH Device
- The Virtual IP Address


### 7.1 Cluster bootstrap and more
Add cluster bootstrap. Create the file and add the text as following:
```
sapprdhdb95:~ # vi crm-bs.txt
# enter the following to crm-bs.txt
property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \
no-quorum-policy="ignore" \
stonith-enabled="true" \
stonith-action="reboot" \
stonith-timeout="150s"
rsc_defaults $id="rsc-options" \
resource-stickiness="1000" \
migration-threshold="5000"
op_defaults $id="op-options" \
timeout="600"
```
Add the configuration to the cluster.
```
crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
```
![Screenshot shows part of a console window running the c r m command.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/crm-configure-crmbs.png)

### 7.2 STONITH device
Add resource STONITH. Create the file and add the text as following.
```
# vi crm-sbd.txt
# enter the following to crm-sbd.txt
primitive stonith-sbd stonith:external/sbd \
params pcmk_delay_max="15"
```
Add the configuration to the cluster.
```
crm configure load update crm-sbd.txt
```

### 7.3 The virtual IP address
Add resource virtual IP. Create the file and add the text as below.
```
# vi crm-vip.txt
primitive rsc_ip_HA1_HDB10 ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
operations $id="rsc_ip_HA1_HDB10-operations" \
op monitor interval="10s" timeout="20s" \
params ip="10.35.0.197"
```
Add the configuration to the cluster.
```
crm configure load update crm-vip.txt
```

### 7.4 Validate the resources

When you run command *crm_mon*, you can see the two resources there.
![Screenshot shows a console window with two resources.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/crm_mon_command.png)

Also, you can see the status at *https://\<node IP address>:7630/cib/live/state*

![Screenshot shows the status of the two resources.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/hawlk-status-page.png)

## 8. Testing the failover process
To test the failover process, stop the pacemaker service on node1, and the resources failover to node2.
```
Service pacemaker stop
```
Now, stop the pacemaker service on **node2** and resources failed over to **node1**

**Before failover**  
![Screenshot shows the status of the two resources before failover.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/Before-failover.png)  

**After failover**  
![Screenshot shows the status of the two resources after failover.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/after-failover.png)  
![Screenshot shows a console window with the status of resources after failover.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/crm-mon-after-failover.png)  


## 9. Troubleshooting
This section describes the few failure scenarios, which can be encountered during the setup. You may not necessarily face these issues.

### Scenario 1: Cluster node not online
If any of the nodes does not show online in cluster manager, you can try following to bring it online.

Start the iSCSI service
```
service iscsid start
```

And now you should be able to log in to that iSCSI node
```
iscsiadm -m node -l
```
The expected output looks like following
```
sapprdhdb45:~ # iscsiadm -m node -l
Logging in to [iface: default, target: iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:hanadc11:1:t020, portal: 10.250.22.11,3260] (multiple)

### Scenario 6: Node 2 unable to join the cluster

When joining the node2 to the existing cluster using *ha-cluster-join* command, the following error occurred.

```
ERROR: Can’t retrieve SSH keys from <Primary Node>
```

![Screenshot shows a console window with the error message Can’t retrieve S S H keys from an I P address.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/ha-cluster-join-error.png)

To fix, run the following on both the nodes

```
ssh-keygen -q -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa -C 'Cluster Internal' -N ''
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

![Screenshot shows part of a console window running the command on the second node.](media/HowToHLI/HASetupWithStonith/ssh-keygen-node2.PNG)

After the preceding fix, node2 should get added to the cluster
