# Use Azure to host and run SAP workload scenarios

When you use Microsoft Azure, you can reliably run your mission-critical SAP workloads and scenarios on a scalable, compliant, and enterprise-proven platform. You get the scalability, flexibility, and cost savings of Azure. With the expanded partnership between Microsoft and SAP, you can run SAP applications across development and test and production scenarios in Azure and be fully supported. From SAP NetWeaver to SAP S/4HANA, SAP BI on Linux to Windows, and SAP HANA to SQL, we've got you covered.

Besides hosting SAP NetWeaver scenarios with the different DBMS on Azure, you can host other SAP workload scenarios, like SAP BI on Azure. 

The uniqueness of Azure for SAP HANA is an offer that sets Azure apart. To enable hosting more memory and CPU resource-demanding SAP scenarios that involve SAP HANA, Azure offers the use of customer-dedicated bare-metal hardware. Use this solution to run SAP HANA deployments that require up to 24 TB (120 TB scale-out) of memory for S/4HANA or other SAP HANA workload. 

Hosting SAP workload scenarios in Azure also can create requirements of identity integration and single sign-on. This situation can occur when you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to connect different SAP components and SAP software-as-a-service (SaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offers. A list of such integration and single sign-on scenarios with Azure AD and SAP entities is described and documented in the section "Azure AD SAP identity integration and single sign-on."

## Changes to the SAP workload section
Changes to documents in the SAP on Azure workload section are listed at the end of this article. The entries in the change log are kept for around 180 days.

## You want to know
If you have specific questions, we are going to point you to specific documents or flows in this section of the start page. You want to know:

- What Azure VMs and HANA Large Instance units are supported for which SAP software releases and which operating system versions. Read the document [What SAP software is supported for Azure deployment](./sap-supported-product-on-azure.md) for answers and the process to find the information
- What SAP deployment scenarios are supported with Azure VMs and HANA Large Instances. Information about the supported scenarios can be found in the documents:
	- [SAP workload on Azure virtual machine supported scenarios](./sap-planning-supported-configurations.md)
	- [Supported scenarios for HANA Large Instance](./hana-supported-scenario.md)
- What Azure Services, Azure VM types and Azure storage services are available in the different Azure regions, check the site [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/) 
- Are third party HA frame works, besides Windows and Pacemaker supported? Check bottom part of [SAP support note #1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533)
- What Azure storage is best for my scenario? Read [Azure Storage types for SAP workload](./planning-guide-storage.md)
- Is the Red Hat kernel in Oracle Enterprise Linux supported by SAP? Read SAP [SAP support note #1565179](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1565179)
- Why are the Azure [Da(s)v4](../../dav4-dasv4-series.md)/[Ea(s)](../../eav4-easv4-series.md) VM families not certified for SAP HANA? The Azure Das/Eas VM families are based on AMD processor driven hardware. SAP HANA does not support AMD processors, not even in virtualized scenarios
- Why am I still getting the message: 'The cpu flags for the RDTSCP instruction or the cpu flags for constant_tsc or nonstop_tsc are not set or current_clocksource and available_clocksource are not correctly configured' with SAP HANA, despite the fact that I am running the most recent Linux kernels. For the answer, check [SAP support note #2791572](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2791572)
- Where can I find architectures for deploying SAP Fiori on Azure? Check out the blog [SAP on Azure: Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) v2 Setup for Internet facing SAP Fiori Apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/03/sap-on-azure-application-gateway-web-application-firewall-waf-v2-setup-for-internet-facing-sap-fiori-apps/) 

 
## SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances)

A series of documents leads you through SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances), or for short, HANA Large Instances. For information on HANA Large Instances, start with the document [Overview and architecture of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances)](./hana-overview-architecture.md) and go through the related documentation in the HANA Large Instance section



## SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines
This section of the documentation covers different aspects of SAP HANA. As a prerequisite, you should be familiar with the principal services of Azure that provide elementary services of Azure IaaS. So, you need knowledge of Azure compute, storage, and networking. Many of these subjects are handled in the SAP NetWeaver-related [Azure planning guide](./planning-guide.md). 

 

## SAP NetWeaver deployed on Azure virtual machines
This section lists planning and deployment documentation for SAP NetWeaver, SAP LaMa and Business One on Azure. The documentation focuses on the basics and the use of non-HANA databases with an SAP workload on Azure. The documents and articles for high availability are also the foundation for SAP HANA high availability in Azure

## SAP NetWeaver and S/4HANA high availability
High Availability of SAP application layer and DBMS is documented into the details starting with the document [Azure Virtual Machines high availability for SAP NetWeaver](./sap-high-availability-guide-start.md)



## Integrate Azure AD with SAP Services
In this section, you can find information in how to configure SSO with most of the SAP SaaS and PaaS services, NetWeaver, and Fiori 



## Documentation on integration of Azure services into SAP components
In this section, you find documents about Microsoft Power BI integration into SAP data sources as well as Azure Data Factory integration into SAP BW.
