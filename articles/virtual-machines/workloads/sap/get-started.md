# Use Azure to host and run SAP workload scenarios

When you use Microsoft Azure, you can reliably run your mission-critical SAP workloads and scenarios on a scalable, compliant, and enterprise-proven platform. You get the scalability, flexibility, and cost savings of Azure. With the expanded partnership between Microsoft and SAP, you can run SAP applications across development and test and production scenarios in Azure and be fully supported. From SAP NetWeaver to SAP S/4HANA, SAP BI on Linux to Windows, and SAP HANA to SQL, we've got you covered.

Besides hosting SAP NetWeaver scenarios with the different DBMS on Azure, you can host other SAP workload scenarios, like SAP BI on Azure. 

The uniqueness of Azure for SAP HANA is an offer that sets Azure apart. To enable hosting more memory and CPU resource-demanding SAP scenarios that involve SAP HANA, Azure offers the use of customer-dedicated bare-metal hardware. Use this solution to run SAP HANA deployments that require up to 24 TB (120-TB scale-out) of memory for S/4HANA or other SAP HANA workload. 

Hosting SAP workload scenarios in Azure also can create requirements of identity integration and single sign-on. This situation can occur when you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to connect different SAP components and SAP software-as-a-service (SaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offers. A list of such integration and single sign-on scenarios with Azure AD and SAP entities is described and documented in the section "AAD SAP identity integration and single sign-on."

## SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines
This section of the documentation covers different aspects of SAP HANA. As a prerequisite, you should be familiar with the principal services of Azure that provide elementary services of Azure IaaS. So, you need knowledge of Azure compute, storage, and networking. Many of these subjects are handled in the SAP NetWeaver-related [Azure planning guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/planning-guide). 

For information on HANA on Azure, see the following articles and their subarticles:

- [Quickstart: Manual installation of single-instance SAP HANA on Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-get-started)
- [Deploy SAP S/4HANA or BW/4HANA on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/cal-s4h)

## SAP NetWeaver deployed on Azure virtual machines
This section lists planning and deployment documentation for SAP NetWeaver and Business One on Azure.
