## Prerequisites

- Kdump service uses `/var/crash` directory to write dumps, make sure the partition corresponds to this directory has sufficient space to accommodate dumps.

## Setup details

- Script to enable Kdump can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana/blob/master/tools/enable-kdump.sh)

- Run this script on HANA Large Instance using the below command

    > [!NOTE]
    > sudo privilege needed to run this command.

    ```bash
    sudo bash enable-kdump.sh
    ```

- If the command outputs Kdump is successfully enabled, please reboot the system to apply the change, then the Kdump is successfully enabled. Reboot the system to apply changes.

- If the command output is Failed to do certain operation, Exiting!!!!, then Kdump service is not enabled. Refer to section [Support issue](#support-issue).

## Test Kdump

> [!NOTE]
>  Below operation will trigger a kernel crash and system reboot.

- Trigger a kernel crash

    ```bash
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
    echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    ```

- After the system reboots successfully, check the `/var/crash` directory for kernel crash logs.

- If the `/var/crash` has directory with current date, then the Kdump is successfully enabled.

## Support issue

If the script fails with an error or Kdump isn't enabled, raise service request with Microsoft support team with following details.

* HLI subscription ID

* Server name

* OS vendor
