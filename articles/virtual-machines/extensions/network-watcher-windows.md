# Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension for Windows

## Overview

[Azure Network Watcher](../../network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview.md) is a network performance monitoring, diagnostic, and analytics service that allows monitoring of Azure networks. The Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension is a requirement for capturing network traffic on demand, and other advanced functionality on Azure virtual machines.


This document details the supported platforms and deployment options for the Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension for Windows. Installation of the agent does not disrupt, or require a reboot, of the virtual machine. You can deploy the extension into virtual machines that you deploy. If the virtual machine is deployed by an Azure service, check the documentation for the service to determine whether or not it permits installing extensions in the virtual machine.

## Prerequisites

### Operating system

The Network Watcher Agent extension for Windows can be run against Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016 and 2019 releases. Nano Server is not supported at this time.

### Internet connectivity

Some of the Network Watcher Agent functionality requires that the target virtual machine be connected to the Internet. Without the ability to establish outgoing connections, the Network Watcher Agent will not be able to upload packet captures to your storage account. For more details, please see the [Network Watcher documentation](../../network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview.md).

## Extension schema

The following JSON shows the schema for the Network Watcher Agent extension. The extension neither requires, nor supports, any user-supplied settings, and relies on its default configuration.

```json
{
    "type": "extensions",
    "name": "Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher",
    "apiVersion": "[variables('apiVersion')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher",
        "type": "NetworkWatcherAgentWindows",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.4",
        "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true
    }
}
```

### Property values

| Name | Value / Example |
| ---- | ---- |
| apiVersion | 2015-06-15 |
| publisher | Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher |
| type | NetworkWatcherAgentWindows |
| typeHandlerVersion | 1.4 |


## Template deployment

You can deploy Azure VM extensions with Azure Resource Manager templates. You can use the JSON schema detailed in the previous section in an Azure Resource Manager template to run the Network Watcher Agent extension during an Azure Resource Manager template deployment.

## PowerShell deployment

Use the `Set-AzVMExtension` command to deploy the Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension to an existing virtual machine:

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup1" `
  -Location "WestUS" `
  -VMName "myVM1" `
  -Name "networkWatcherAgent" `
  -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher" `
  -Type "NetworkWatcherAgentWindows" `
  -TypeHandlerVersion "1.4"
```

## Troubleshooting and support

### Troubleshooting

You can retrieve data about the state of extension deployments from the Azure portal and PowerShell. To see the deployment state of extensions for a given VM, run the following command using the Azure PowerShell module:

```powershell
Get-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup1 -VMName myVM1 -Name networkWatcherAgent
```

Extension execution output is logged to files found in the following directory:

```cmd
C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher.NetworkWatcherAgentWindows\
```

### Support

If you need more help at any point in this article, you can refer to the Network Watcher User Guide documentation or contact the Azure experts on the [MSDN Azure and Stack Overflow forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/forums/). Alternatively, you can file an Azure support incident. Go to the [Azure support site](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) and select Get support.
