# Tagging a VM using the portal

This article describes how to add tags to a VM using the portal. Tags are user-defined key/value pairs which can be placed directly on a resource or a resource group. Azure currently supports up to 50 tags per resource and resource group. Tags may be placed on a resource at the time of creation or added to an existing resource.


1. Navigate to your VM in the portal.
1. In **Essentials**, select **Click here to add tags**.
