# NVv4-series 

The NVv4-series virtual machines are powered by [AMD Radeon Instinct MI25](https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/instinct-mi25) GPUs and AMD EPYC 7V12(Rome) CPUs. With NVv4-series Azure is introducing virtual machines with partial GPUs. Pick the right sized virtual machine for GPU accelerated graphics applications and virtual desktops starting at 1/8th of a GPU with 2 GiB frame buffer to a full GPU with 16 GiB frame buffer. NVv4 virtual machines currently support only Windows guest operating system.

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure NVv4-series VMs running Windows, AMD GPU drivers must be installed.

To install AMD GPU drivers manually, see [N-series AMD GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-amd-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.
