# NC-series

NC-series VMs are powered by the [NVIDIA Tesla K80](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/tesla-product-literature/Tesla-K80-BoardSpec-07317-001-v05.pdf) card and the Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 (Haswell) processor. Users can crunch through data faster by leveraging CUDA for energy exploration applications, crash simulations, ray traced rendering, deep learning, and more. The NC24r configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads.

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed.

The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) for supported operating systems and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](./extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-driver-setup.md) or [N-series GPU driver setup for Linux](./linux/n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.
