# Azure Percept DK troubleshooting

See the guidance below for general troubleshooting tips for the Azure Percept DK.

## General troubleshooting commands

To run these commands, [SSH into the dev kit](./how-to-ssh-into-percept-dk.md) and enter the commands into the SSH client prompt.

To redirect any output to a .txt file for further analysis, use the following syntax:

```console
sudo [command] > [file name].txt
```

Change the permissions of the .txt file so it can be copied:

```console
sudo chmod 666 [file name].txt
```

After redirecting output to a .txt file, copy the file to your host PC via SCP:

```console
scp [remote username]@[IP address]:[remote file path]/[file name].txt [local host file path]
```

```[local host file path]``` refers to the location on your host PC that you would like to copy the .txt file to. ```[remote username]``` is the SSH username chosen during the [setup experience](./quickstart-percept-dk-set-up.md).

For additional information on the Azure IoT Edge commands, see the [Azure IoT Edge device troubleshooting documentation](../iot-edge/troubleshoot.md).

## USB updates

|Error:                                    |Solution:                                               |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|LIBUSB_ERROR_XXX during USB flash via UUU |This error is the result of a USB connection failure during UUU updating. If the USB cable is not properly connected to the USB ports on the PC or the Percept DK carrier board, an error of this form will occur. Try unplugging and reconnecting both ends of the USB cable and jiggling the cable to ensure a secure connection. This almost always solves the issue. |

## Azure Percept DK carrier board LED states

There are three small LEDs on top of the carrier board housing. A cloud icon is printed next to LED 1, a Wi-Fi icon is printed next to LED 2, and an exclamation mark icon is printed next to LED 3. See the table below for information on each LED state.

|LED             |State      |Description                      |

|LED 1 (IoT Hub) |On (solid) |Device is connected to an IoT Hub. |
|LED 2 (Wi-Fi)   |Slow blink |Device is ready to be configured by Wi-Fi Easy Connect and is announcing its presence to a configurator. |
|LED 2 (Wi-Fi)   |Fast blink |Authentication was successful, device association in progress. |
|LED 2 (Wi-Fi)   |On (solid) |Authentication and association were successful; device is connected to a Wi-Fi network. |
|LED 3           |NA         |LED not in use. |
