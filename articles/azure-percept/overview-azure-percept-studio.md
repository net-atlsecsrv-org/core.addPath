# Azure Percept Studio Overview

[Azure Percept Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2135819) is the single launch point for creating edge AI models and solutions. Azure Percept Studio allows you to discover and complete guided workflows that make it easy to integrate edge AI capable hardware and powerful Azure AI and IoT cloud services.

In the Studio, you can see your edge AI capable devices as end points for collecting initial and ongoing training data as well as deployment targets for model iterations. Having access to devices and training data allows for rapid prototyping and iterative Edge AI model development for both [vision](./tutorial-nocode-vision.md) and [speech](./tutorial-no-code-speech.md) scenarios.

The workflows in Azure Percept Studio integrate many underlying Azure AI and IoT services, like Azure IoT Hub, Custom Vision, Speech Studio, and Azure ML Services, so you can use these services to create an end-to-end solution, without significant pre-existing knowledge. If you are already familiar with these Azure services, you can also connect to and modify existing resources outside of the Azure Percept Studio.
