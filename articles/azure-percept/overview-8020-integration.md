# Azure Percept DK 80/20 integration overview

The Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory were designed to integrate with the [80/20 T-slot aluminum building system](https://8020.net/).

## 80/20 features

The Azure Percept DK carrier board, Azure Percept Vision device, and Azure Percept Audio accessory are manufactured with built-in 80/20 1010 connectors, which allow for endless mounting configurations with 80/20 rails. This integration enables customers and solution builders to more easily extend their proof of concepts to production environments.
