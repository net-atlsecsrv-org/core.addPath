# Advanced development with Azure Percept
With Azure Percept, software developers and data scientists are able to use advanced code workflows for AI Lifecycle management. Through a growing open source library, they can use samples to get started with their AI development journey and build production ready solutions.

## Get started with the advanced development tutorials

Learn about all of the available [Azure Percept AI models](./overview-ai-models.md).

Please see the [Azure Percept DK advanced development GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-percept-advanced-development) for
up-to-date guidance, tutorials, and examples for things like:

* Bringing a custom AI model to the device
* Updating a model we already support with transfer learning
* And more

## Next steps

Learn about all of the available [Azure Percept AI models](./overview-ai-models.md). If none of these models suit your needs,
feel free to use the advanced code journey to bring your own model or computer vision pipeline to the Percept DK,
and if you feel it would help others, open a pull request too!
