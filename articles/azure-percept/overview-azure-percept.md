# Introduction to Azure Percept

Azure Percept is a family of hardware, software, and services designed to accelerate business transformation using IoT and AI at the edge. Azure Percept covers the full stack from silicon to services to solve the integration challenges of edge AI at scale.  

The integration challenges one faces when attempting to deploy edge AI solutions at scale can be summed up into three major points of friction:

- Identifying and selecting the right silicon to power the solutions.
- Ensuring the collective security of the hardware, software, models, and data.
- The ability to build and manage solutions that seamlessly work at scale.
