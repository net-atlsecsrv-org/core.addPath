# Dev Tools Pack Installer Overview

The Dev Tools Pack Installer is a one-stop solution that installs and configures all of the tools required to develop an Intelligent Edge solution. If you have already installed any of the software packages listed below, the Dev Tools Pack Installer will reinstall those packages so that your tools are consistent with the Installer software versions.

## Mandatory Tools Installed

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Python 3.6 (Windows) or 3.5 (Linux)](https://www.python.org/)
* [Docker 19.03](https://www.docker.com/)
* [PIP3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)
* [TensorFlow 1.13](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Azure Machine Learning SDK 1.1](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/)

## Optional Tools Available for Installation

* [Nvidia DeepStream SDK 5](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk) (Toolkit for developing solutions for Nvidia Accelerators)
* [Intel OpenVino Toolkit 2020.2](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/) (Toolkit for developing solutions for Intel Accelerators)
* [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai/)  
* [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
* [Pytorch 1.4.0 (Windows) or 1.2.0 (Linux)](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [Chainer 5.2](https://chainer.org/)
* [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
* [CUDA Toolkit 10.0.130](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
* [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit 2.5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/?lang=fr_ca)

## Known Issues

- Optional Caffe install may fail if Docker is not running properly on system. If you would like to install Caffe, make sure Docker is installed and running before attempting Caffe installation through the Dev Tools Pack Installer. 

- Optional CUDA install fails on incompatible systems. Before attempting to install the [CUDA Toolkit 10.0.130](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) through the Dev Tools Pack Installer, verify your system compatibility.

## Minimum Requirements

* Docker minimum Requirements:

    * Windows:
        * https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#system-requirements

        - Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 16299 or later).

             For Windows 10 Home, see Install Docker Desktop on Windows Home.
           - Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled.
           - The following hardware prerequisites are required to successfully run Client Hyper-V on Windows 10:

              - 64-bit processor with [Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation)
              - 4-GB system RAM
              - BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the BIOS settings. For more information, see Virtualization.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Docker supports Docker Desktop on Windows based on Microsoft’s support lifecycle for Windows 10 operating system. For more information, see the [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet).

    * Mac:
        * https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#system-requirements
       
        Your Mac must meet the following requirements to successfully install Docker Desktop:
         
         - **Mac hardware must be a 2010 or a newer model with an Intel processor**, with Intel’s hardware support for memory management unit (MMU) virtualization, including Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode. You can check to see if your machine has this support by running the following command in a terminal: ```sysctl kern.hv_support```

        If your Mac supports the Hypervisor framework, the command prints ```kern.hv_support: 1```.

         - **macOS must be version 10.14 or newer**. That is, Mojave, Catalina, or Big Sur. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS.

        If you experience any issues after upgrading your macOS to version 10.15, you must install the latest version of Docker Desktop to be compatible with this version of macOS.

        - At least 4 GB of RAM.
        - VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must not be installed as it is not compatible with Docker Desktop.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Docker supports Docker Desktop on the most recent versions of macOS. That is, the current release of macOS and the previous two releases. As new major versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the previous two releases). Docker Desktop currently supports macOS Mojave, macOS Catalina, and macOS Big Sur.
        > 
        - The installer is not supported on Apple M1.

## Docker status check

If the installer notifies you to verify Docker Desktop is in a good running state, see the following steps:

   1. Windows:
   
      1. Expand system tray hidden icons:
      
         1. Expand system tray hidden icons if hidden:

         1. If you do not see the above icon listed in the system tray, launch Docker Desktop from the start menu.
         
         1. If Docker prompts you to reboot, it's fine to close the installer and relaunch after a reboot has completed and Docker is in a running state. Any successfully installed third-party applications should be detected and will not be automatically reinstalled.
