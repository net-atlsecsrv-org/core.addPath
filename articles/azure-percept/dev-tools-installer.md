# Dev Tools Pack Installer overview

The Dev Tools Pack Installer is a one-stop solution that installs and configures all of the tools required to develop an advanced intelligent edge solution.

## Mandatory tools

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/)
* [Docker 19.03](https://www.docker.com/)
* [PIP3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)
* [TensorFlow 1.13](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Azure Machine Learning SDK 1.1](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/)

## Optional tools

* [Nvidia DeepStream SDK 5](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk) (toolkit for developing solutions for Nvidia Accelerators)
* [Intel OpenVino Toolkit 2020.2](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/) (toolkit for developing solutions for Intel Accelerators)
* [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai/)  
* [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
* [Pytorch 1.4.0 (Windows) or 1.2.0 (Linux)](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [Chainer 5.2](https://chainer.org/)
* [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
* [CUDA Toolkit 10.0.130](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
* [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit 2.5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/?lang=fr_ca)

## Known issues

- Optional Caffe install may fail if Docker is not running properly. If you would like to install Caffe, make sure Docker is installed and running before attempting the Caffe installation through the Dev Tools Pack Installer.

- Optional CUDA install fails on incompatible systems. Before attempting to install the [CUDA Toolkit 10.0.130](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) through the Dev Tools Pack Installer, verify your system compatibility.

## Docker minimum requirements

### Windows

- Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (build 16299 or later).

- Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled. The following hardware prerequisites are required to successfully run Hyper-V on Windows 10:

    - 64-bit processor with [Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation)
    - 4 GB system RAM
    - BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the BIOS settings. For more information, see Virtualization.

> [!NOTE]
> Docker supports Docker Desktop on Windows based on Microsoft’s support lifecycle for Windows 10 operating system. For more information, see the [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet).

Learn more about [installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows).

### Mac

- Mac must be a 2010 or a newer model with the following attributes:
    - Intel processor
    - Intel’s hardware support for memory management unit (MMU) virtualization, including Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode. You can check to see if your machine has this support by running the following command in a terminal: ```sysctl kern.hv_support```. If your Mac supports the Hypervisor framework, the command prints ```kern.hv_support: 1```.

- macOS version 10.14 or newer (Mojave, Catalina, or Big Sur). We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS. If you experience any issues after upgrading your macOS to version 10.15, you must install the latest version of Docker Desktop to be compatible with this version of macOS.

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

- Do NOT install VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30--it is not compatible with Docker Desktop.

- The installer is not supported on Apple M1.

    1. If you are working with the Azure Percept Audio SoM, which is part of the Azure Percept DK, make sure to install the Intel OpenVino Toolkit and Miniconda3.

    1. Click **Install** to proceed with the installation.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/dev-tools-installer/dev-tools-configure-components.png" alt-text="Installer screen showing available software packages.":::

## Docker status check

If the installer notifies you to verify Docker Desktop is in a good running state, see the following steps:

### Windows

1. Expand system tray hidden icons.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/dev-tools-installer/system-tray.png" alt-text="System Tray.":::

1. Verify the Docker Desktop icon shows **Docker Desktop is Running**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/dev-tools-installer/docker-status-running.png" alt-text="Docker Status.":::

1. If you do not see the above icon listed in the system tray, launch Docker Desktop from the start menu.

1. If Docker prompts you to reboot, it's fine to close the installer and relaunch after a reboot has completed and Docker is in a running state. Any successfully installed third-party applications should be detected and will not be automatically reinstalled.
