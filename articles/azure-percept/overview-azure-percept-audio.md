# Introduction to Azure Percept Audio

Azure Percept Audio is an accessory device that adds speech AI capabilities to the Azure Percept DK. It contains a preconfigured audio processor and a four-microphone linear array, enabling you to apply voice commanding, keyword spotting, and far field speech to local listening devices using Azure Cognitive Services. Azure Percept Audio enables device manufacturers to extend Azure Percept DK beyond vision capabilities to new, smart voice-activated devices. It is integrated out-of-the-box with Azure Percept DK, Azure Percept Studio, and other Azure edge management services. It is available for purchase at the [Microsoft online store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2155270).

## Azure Percept Audio components

Azure Percept Audio contains the following major components:

- Production-ready Azure Percept Audio device (SoM) with four-microphone linear array and audio processing done by an XMOS Codec
- Developer (Interposer) board (includes 2x buttons, 3x LEDs, Micro USB, and 3.5 mm Audio Jack)
- Required cables: FPC cable, USB Micro Type-B to USB-A
- Welcome card
- Mechanical mounting plate with integrated 80/20 1010 series mount

## Compute capabilities ​

Azure Percept Audio passes the audio input through the speech stack that runs on the CPU of the carrier board of the Azure Percept DK in a hybrid edge-cloud manner. Therefore, Azure Percept Audio requires a carrier board with an OS that supports the speech stack in order to perform. ​

The processing is done as follows: ​

- Azure Percept Audio: captures and converts the audio and sends it to the DK and audio jack.

- Azure Percept DK: the speech stack performs beam forming and echo cancellation and processes the incoming audio to optimize for speech. It then performs the keyword spotting.

- Cloud: processes natural language commands and phrases, keyword verification, and retraining. ​

- Offline: if the device is offline, it will detect the keyword and capture internet connection status telemetry. An increased false accept rate for keyword spotting may be observed as keyword verification in the cloud cannot be performed. ​
