# Tutorial: Publish a Hugo site to Azure Static Web Apps Preview

This article demonstrates how to create and deploy a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) web application to [Azure Azure Static Web Apps](overview.md). The final result is a new Azure Static Web Apps with the associated GitHub Actions that give you control over how the app is built and published.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free](https://github.com/join).

## Create a Hugo App

Create a Hugo app using the Hugo Command Line Interface (CLI):

1. Follow the [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for Hugo on your OS.

1. Open a terminal

1. Run the Hugo CLI to create a new app.

   ```bash
   hugo new site static-app
   ```

1. Navigate to the newly created app.

   ```bash
   cd static-app
   ```

1. Initialize a git repo.

   ```bash
    git init
   ```

1. Next, add a theme to the site by installing a theme as a git submodule and then specifying it in the Hugo config file.

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
   echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
   ```

1. Commit the changes.

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```

## Push your application to GitHub

You need a repository on GitHub to connect to Azure Static Web Apps. The following steps show you how to create a repository for your site.

1. Create a blank GitHub repo (don't create a README) from [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) named **hugo-static-app**.

1. Add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local repo. Make sure to add your GitHub username in place of the `<YOUR_USER_NAME>` placeholder in the following command.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/hugo-static-app
   ```

1. Push your local repo up to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin master
   ```

## Deploy your web app

The following steps show you how to create a new static site app and deploy it to a production environment.

### Create the application

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Click **Create a Resource**
1. Search for **Static Web Apps**

### Build

Next, you add configuration settings that the build process uses to build your app. The following settings configure the GitHub Action workflow file.

1. Click the **Next: Build >** button to edit the build configuration

1. Set _App location_ to **public**.

1. Leave the _App artifact location_ blank.

   A value for _API location_ isn't necessary as you aren't deploying an API at the moment.

### Review and create

1. Click the **Review + Create** button to verify the details are all correct.

1. Click **Create** to start the creation of the Azure Static Web Apps and provision a GitHub Action for deployment.

1. Once the deployment completes, navigate to your terminal and pull the commit with the GitHub Action to your machine.

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

1. Open the Hugo app in a text editor and open the _.github/workflows/azure-pages-<WORKFLOW_NAME>.yml_ file.

1. Replace the line `- uses: actions/checkout@v2` (line 18) with the following, to build the Hugo application. If you require Hugo Extended, uncomment `extended: true`.

   ```yml
   - uses: actions/checkout@v2
     with:
       submodules: true

   - name: Setup Hugo
     uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.4.8
     with:
       hugo-version: "latest"
       # extended: true

   - name: Build
     run: hugo
   ```

1. Commit the updated workflow and push to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Updating GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push
   ```

1. Wait for the GitHub Action to complete.

1. In the Azure portal's _Overview_ window of newly created Azure Static Web Apps resource, click the _URL_ link to open your deployed application.
