# Azure security baseline for Application Gateway

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Application Gateway. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Application Gateway. **Controls** not applicable to Application Gateway have been excluded.

 
To see how Application Gateway completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Application Gateway security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: Ensure that all Virtual Network Azure Application Gateway subnet deployments have a network security group (NSG) applied with network access controls specific to your application's trusted ports and sources. While network security groups are supported on Azure Application Gateway, there are some restrictions and requirements that must be adhered to in order for your NSG and Azure Application Gateway to function as expected.

- [Understand restrictions and requirements around using NSGs with Azure Application Gateway](configuration-overview.md)

- [How to create an NSG with a security configuration](../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: The [Azure Security Benchmark](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark.md) is the default policy initiative for Security Center and is the foundation for [Security Center's recommendations](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/security-center-recommendations.md). The Azure Policy definitions related to this control are enabled automatically by Security Center. Alerts related to this control may require an [Azure Defender](/home/mbaldwin/docs/asb/azure-docs-pr/articles/security-center/azure-defender.md) plan for the related services.

**Azure Policy built-in definitions - Microsoft.Network**:

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: For the network security groups (NSGs) associated with your Azure Application Gateway subnets, enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics Workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

Note: There are some cases where NSG flow logs associated with your Azure Application Gateway subnets won't show traffic that has been allowed. If your configuration matches following scenario, you won't see allowed traffic in your NSG flow logs:

- You've deployed Application Gateway v2
- You have an NSG on the application gateway subnet
- You've enabled NSG flow logs on that NSG

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: Deploy Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of critical web applications for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a service (feature of Azure Application Gateway) that provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Azure WAF can help secure your Azure App Service web apps by inspecting inbound web traffic to block attacks such as SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, malware uploads, and DDoS attacks. WAF is based on rules from the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) core rule sets 3.1 (WAF_v2 only), 3.0, and 2.2.9.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., GatewayManager) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

For the network security groups (NSGs) associated with your Azure Application Gateway subnets, you must allow incoming Internet traffic on TCP ports 65503-65534 for the Application Gateway v1 SKU, and TCP ports 65200-65535 for the v2 SKU with the destination subnet as Any and source as GatewayManager service tag. This port range is required for Azure infrastructure communication. These ports are protected (locked down) by Azure certificates. External entities, including the customers of those gateways, can't communicate on these endpoints.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings related to your Azure Application Gateway deployments. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.Network" namespace to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Application Gateways, Azure Virtual Networks, and network security groups. You may also make use of built-in policy definition.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), and policies in a single blueprint definition. You can easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions, environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use Tags for network security groups (NSGs) associated with your Azure Application Gateway subnet as well as any other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure Application Gateway and related resources, such as network security groups (NSGs), being used to protect the Azure Application Gateway subnet.

In addition to Activity Logs, you can configure diagnostic settings for your Azure Application Gateway deployments. diagnostic settings are used to configure streaming export of platform logs and metrics for a resource to the destination of your choice (Storage Accounts, Event Hubs and Log Analytics).

Azure Application Gateway also offers built-in integration with Azure Application Insights. Application Insights collects log, performance, and error data. Application Insights automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand how your web apps are being used. You may enable continuous export to export telemetry from Application Insights into a centralized location to keep the data for longer than the standard retention period.
