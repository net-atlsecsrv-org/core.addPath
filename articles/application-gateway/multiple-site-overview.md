# Application Gateway multiple site hosting

Multiple site hosting enables you to configure more than one web application on the same port of an application gateway. It allows you to configure a more efficient topology for your deployments by adding up to 100+ websites to one application gateway. Each website can be directed to its own backend pool. For example, three domains, contoso.com, fabrikam.com, and adatum.com, point to the IP address of the application gateway. You'd create three multi-site listeners and configure each listener for the respective port and protocol setting. 

You can also define wildcard host names in a multi-site listener and up to 5 host names per listener. To learn more, see [wildcard host names in listener](#wildcard-host-names-in-listener-preview).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rules are processed in the order they are listed in the portal for the v1 SKU. For the v2 SKU, exact matches have higher precedence. It is highly recommended to configure multi-site listeners first prior to configuring a basic listener.  This will ensure that traffic gets routed to the right back end. If a basic listener is listed first and matches an incoming request, it gets processed by that listener.

Requests for `http://contoso.com` are routed to ContosoServerPool, and `http://fabrikam.com` are routed to FabrikamServerPool.

Similarly, you can host multiple subdomains of the same parent domain on the same application gateway deployment. For example, you can  host `http://blog.contoso.com` and `http://app.contoso.com` on a single application gateway deployment.

## Wildcard host names in listener (Preview)

Application Gateway allows host-based routing using multi-site HTTP(S) listener. Now, you have the ability to use wildcard characters like asterisk (*) and question mark (?) in the host name, and up to 5 host names per multi-site HTTP(S) listener. For example, `*.contoso.com`.

Using a wildcard character in the host name, you can match multiple host names in a single listener. For example, `*.contoso.com` can match with `ecom.contoso.com`, `b2b.contoso.com` as well as `customer1.b2b.contoso.com` and so on. Using an array of host names, you can configure more than one host name for a listener, to route requests to a backend pool. For example, a listener can contain `contoso.com, fabrikam.com` which will accept requests for both the host names.

>[!NOTE]
> This feature is in preview and is available only for Standard_v2 and WAF_v2 SKU of Application Gateway. To learn more about previews, see [terms of use here](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

>[!NOTE]
>This feature is currently available only through [Azure PowerShell](tutorial-multiple-sites-powershell.md) and [Azure CLI](tutorial-multiple-sites-cli.md). Portal support is coming soon.

In [Azure PowerShell](tutorial-multiple-sites-powershell.md), you must use `-HostNames` instead of `-HostName`. With HostNames, you can mention up to 5 host names as comma-separated values and use wildcard characters. For example, `-HostNames "*.contoso.com,*.fabrikam.com"`

In [Azure CLI](tutorial-multiple-sites-cli.md), you must use `--host-names` instead of `--host-name`. With host-names, you can mention up to 5 host names as comma-separated values and use wildcard characters. For example, `--host-names "*.contoso.com,*.fabrikam.com"`

### Allowed characters in the host names field:

* `(A-Z,a-z,0-9)` - alphanumeric characters
* `-` - hyphen or minus
* `.` - period as a delimiter
*	`*` - can match with multiple characters in the allowed range
*	`?` - can match with a single character in the allowed range

### Conditions for using wildcard characters and multiple host names in a listener:

*	You can only mention up to 5 host names in a single listener
*	Asterisk `*` can be mentioned only once in a component of a domain style name or host name. For example, component1*.component2*.component3. `(*.contoso-*.com)` is valid.
*	There can only be up to two asterisks `*` in a host name. For example, `*.contoso.*` is valid and `*.contoso.*.*.com` is invalid.
*	There can only be a maximum of 4 wildcard characters in a host name. For example, `????.contoso.com`, `w??.contoso*.edu.*` are valid, but `????.contoso.*` is invalid.
*	Using asterisk `*` and question mark `?` together in a component of a host name (`*?` or `?*` or `**`) is invalid. For example, `*?.contoso.com` and `**.contoso.com` are invalid.

### Considerations and limitations of using wildcard or multiple host names in a listener:

*	[SSL termination and End-to-End SSL](ssl-overview.md) requires you to configure the protocol as HTTPS and upload a certificate to be used in the listener configuration. If it is a multi-site listener, you can input the host name as well, usually this is the CN of the SSL certificate. When you are specifying multiple host names in the listener or use wildcard characters, you must consider the following:
    *	If it is a wildcard hostname like *.contoso.com, you must upload a wildcard certificate with CN like *.contoso.com
    *	If multiple host names are mentioned in the same listener, you must upload a SAN certificate (Subject Alternative Names) with the CNs matching the host names mentioned.
*	You cannot use a regular expression to mention the host name. You can only use wildcard characters like asterisk (*) and question mark (?) to form the host name pattern.
*	For backend health check, you cannot associate multiple [custom probes](application-gateway-probe-overview.md) per HTTP settings. Instead, you can probe one of the websites at the backend or use “127.0.0.1” to probe the localhost of the backend server. However, when you are using wildcard or multiple host names in a listener, the requests for all the specified domain patterns will be routed to the backend pool depending on the rule type (basic or path-based).
*	The properties “hostname" takes one string as input, where you can mention only one non-wildcard domain name and “hostnames” takes an array of strings as input, where you can mention up to 5 wildcard domain names. But both the properties cannot be used at once.
*	You cannot create a [redirection](redirect-overview.md) rule with a target listener which uses wildcard or multiple host names.

See [create multi-site using Azure PowerShell](tutorial-multiple-sites-powershell.md) or [using Azure CLI](tutorial-multiple-sites-cli.md) for the step-by-step guide on how to configure wildcard host names in a multi-site listener.

## Host headers and Server Name Indication (SNI)

There are three common mechanisms for enabling multiple site hosting on the same infrastructure.

1. Host multiple web applications each on a unique IP address.
2. Use host name to host multiple web applications on the same IP address.
3. Use different ports to host multiple web applications on the same IP address.

Currently Application Gateway supports a single public IP address where it listens for traffic. So multiple applications, each with its own IP address is currently not supported. 

Application Gateway supports multiple applications each listening on different ports, but this scenario requires the applications to accept traffic on non-standard ports. This is often not a configuration that you want.

Application Gateway relies on HTTP 1.1 host headers to host more than one website on the same public IP address and port. The sites hosted on application gateway can also support TLS offload with Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS extension. This scenario means that the client browser and backend web farm must support HTTP/1.1 and TLS extension as defined in RFC 6066.
