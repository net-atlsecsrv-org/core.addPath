# Azure Application Gateway URL path based routing overview

URL Path Based Routing allows you to route traffic to back-end server pools based on URL Paths of the request. 

One of the scenarios is to route requests for different content types to different backend server pools.

In the following example, Application Gateway is serving traffic for contoso.com from three back-end server pools for example: VideoServerPool, ImageServerPool, and DefaultServerPool.

![imageURLroute](./media/url-route-overview/figure1.png)

Requests for <http://contoso.com/video/*> are routed to VideoServerPool, and <http://contoso.com/images/*> are routed to ImageServerPool. DefaultServerPool is selected if none of the path patterns match.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rules are processed in the order they are listed in the portal. It is highly recommended to configure multi-site listeners first prior to configuring a basic listener.  This ensures that traffic gets routed to the right back end. If a basic listener is listed first and matches an incoming request, it gets processed by that listener.

## UrlPathMap configuration element

The urlPathMap element is used to specify Path patterns to back-end server pool mappings. The following code example is the snippet of urlPathMap element from template file.

```json
"urlPathMaps": [{
    "name": "{urlpathMapName}",
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/urlPathMaps/{urlpathMapName}",
    "properties": {
        "defaultBackendAddressPool": {
            "id": "/subscriptions/    {subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/backendAddressPools/{poolName1}"
        },
        "defaultBackendHttpSettings": {
            "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/backendHttpSettingsList/{settingname1}"
        },
        "pathRules": [{
            "name": "{pathRuleName}",
            "properties": {
                "paths": [
                    "{pathPattern}"
                ],
                "backendAddressPool": {
                    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/backendAddressPools/{poolName2}"
                },
                "backendHttpsettings": {
                    "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/backendHttpsettingsList/{settingName2}"
                }
            }
        }]
    }
}]
```

> [!NOTE]
> PathPattern: This setting is a list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a "*" is allowed is at the end following a "/." The string fed to the path matcher does not include any text after the first? or #, and those chars are not allowed here.

You can check out a [Resource Manager template using URL-based routing](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/201-application-gateway-url-path-based-routing) for more information.

## PathBasedRouting rule

RequestRoutingRule of type PathBasedRouting is used to bind a listener to a urlPathMap. All requests that are received for this listener are routed based on policy specified in urlPathMap.
Snippet of PathBasedRouting rule:

```json
"requestRoutingRules": [
    {

"name": "{ruleName}",
"id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/requestRoutingRules/{ruleName}",
"properties": {
    "ruleType": "PathBasedRouting",
    "httpListener": {
        "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/httpListeners/<listenerName>"
    },
    "urlPathMap": {
        "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/../microsoft.network/applicationGateways/{gatewayName}/ urlPathMaps/{urlpathMapName}"
    },

}
    }
]
```
