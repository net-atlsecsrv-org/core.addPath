# Create an application gateway by using the Azure CLI

Azure Application Gateway is a layer-7 load balancer. It provides failover, performance-routing HTTP requests between different servers, whether they are on the cloud or on-premises. Application gateway has the following application delivery features: HTTP load balancing, cookie-based session affinity, and Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), offload, custom health probes, and support for multi-site.

## Prerequisite: Install the Azure CLI

To perform the steps in this article, you need to [install the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md) and you need to [sign in Azure](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli). 

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have an Azure account, you need one. Go sign up for a [free trial here](../active-directory/fundamentals/sign-up-organization.md).

## Scenario

In this scenario, you learn how to create an application gateway using the Azure portal.

This scenario will:

* Create a medium application gateway with two instances.
* Create a virtual network named ContosoVNET with a reserved CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.
* Create a subnet called subnet01 that uses 10.0.0.0/28 as its CIDR block.

> [!NOTE]
> Additional configuration of the application gateway, including custom health probes, backend pool addresses, and additional rules are configured after the application gateway is configured and not during initial deployment.

## Before you begin

Azure Application Gateway requires its own subnet. When creating a virtual network, ensure that you leave enough address space to have multiple subnets. Once you deploy an application gateway to a subnet,
only additional application gateways are able to be added to the subnet.

## Sign in to Azure

Open the **Microsoft Azure Command Prompt**, and sign in.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

Once you type the preceding example, a code is provided. Navigate to https://aka.ms/devicelogin in a browser to continue the sign on process.

![cmd showing device login][1]

In the browser, enter the code you received. You are redirected to a sign-in page.

Once the code has been entered you are signed in, close the browser to continue on with the scenario.

![successfully signed in][3]

## Switch to Resource Manager Mode

```azurecli-interactive
azure config mode arm
```

## Create the resource group

Before creating the application gateway, a resource group is created to contain the application gateway. The following shows the command.

```azurecli-interactive
azure group create \
--name ContosoRG \
--location eastus
```

## Create a virtual network

Once the resource group is created, a virtual network is created for the application gateway.  In the following example, the address space was as 10.0.0.0/16 as defined in the preceding scenario notes.

```azurecli-interactive
azure network vnet create \
--name ContosoVNET \
--address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 \
--resource-group ContosoRG \
--location eastus
```

## Create a subnet

After the virtual network is created, a subnet is added for the application gateway.  If you plan to use application gateway with a web app hosted in the same virtual network as the application gateway, be sure to leave enough room for another subnet.

```azurecli-interactive
azure network vnet subnet create \
--resource-group ContosoRG \
--name subnet01 \
--vnet-name ContosoVNET \
--address-prefix 10.0.0.0/28 
```

## Create the application gateway

Once the virtual network and subnet are created, the pre-requisites for the application gateway are complete. Additionally a previously exported .pfx certificate and the password for the certificate are required for the following step:
The IP addresses used for the backend are the IP addresses for your backend server. These values can be either private IPs in the virtual network, public ips, or fully qualified domain names for your backend servers.

```azurecli-interactive
azure network application-gateway create \
--name AdatumAppGateway \
--location eastus \
--resource-group ContosoRG \
--vnet-name ContosoVNET \
--subnet-name subnet01 \
--servers 134.170.185.46,134.170.188.221,134.170.185.50 \
--capacity 2 \
--sku-tier Standard \
--routing-rule-type Basic \
--frontend-port 80 \
--http-settings-cookie-based-affinity Enabled \
--http-settings-port 80 \
--http-settings-protocol http \
--frontend-port http \
--sku-name Standard_Medium
```

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of parameters that can be provided during creation run the following command: **azure network application-gateway create --help**.

This example creates a basic application gateway with default settings for the listener, backend pool, backend http settings, and rules. You can modify these settings to suit your deployment once the provisioning is successful.
If you already have your web application defined with the backend pool in the preceding steps, once created, load balancing begins.
