# Frequently asked questions about Application Gateway

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

The following are common questions asked about Azure Application Gateway.

## General

### What is Application Gateway?

Azure Application Gateway provides an application delivery controller (ADC) as a service. It offers various layer 7 load-balancing capabilities for your applications. This service is highly available, scalable, and fully managed by Azure.

### What features does Application Gateway support?

Application Gateway supports autoscaling, SSL offloading, and end-to-end SSL, a web application firewall (WAF), cookie-based session affinity, URL path-based routing, multisite hosting, and other features. For a full list of supported features, see [Introduction to Application Gateway](application-gateway-introduction.md).

### How do Application Gateway and Azure Load Balancer differ?

Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer, which means it works only with web traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and HTTP/2). It supports capabilities such as SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and round robin for load-balancing traffic. Load Balancer load-balances traffic at layer 4 (TCP or UDP).

### What protocols does Application Gateway support?

Application Gateway supports HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, and WebSocket.

### How does Application Gateway support HTTP/2?

See [HTTP/2 support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#http2-support).

### What resources are supported as part of a backend pool?

See [supported backend resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-components#backend-pool).

### In what regions is Application Gateway available?

Application Gateway is available in all regions of global Azure. It's also available in [Azure China 21Vianet](https://www.azure.cn/) and [Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/clouds/government/).

### Is this deployment dedicated for my subscription, or is it shared across customers?

Application Gateway is a dedicated deployment in your virtual network.

### Does Application Gateway support HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection?

Redirection is supported. See [Application Gateway redirect overview](application-gateway-redirect-overview.md).

### In what order are listeners processed?

See the [order of listener processing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#order-of-processing-listeners).

### Where do I find the Application Gateway IP and DNS?

If you're using a public IP address as an endpoint, you'll find the IP and DNS information on the public IP address resource. Or find it in the portal, on the overview page for the application gateway. If you're using internal IP addresses, find the information on the overview page.

### What are the settings for Keep-Alive timeout and TCP idle timeout?

 In the Application Gateway v1 SKU, the Keep-Alive timeout is 120 seconds. The Keep-Alive timeout for the v2 SKU is 75 seconds. The TCP idle timeout is a 4-minute default on the frontend virtual IP (VIP) of Application Gateway.

### Does the IP or DNS name change over the lifetime of the application gateway?

The VIP can change if you stop and start the application gateway. But the DNS name associated with the application gateway doesn't change over the lifetime of the gateway. Because the DNS name doesn't change, you should use a CNAME alias and point it to the DNS address of the application gateway.

### Does Application Gateway support static IP?

Yes, the Application Gateway v2 SKU supports static public IP addresses. The v1 SKU supports static internal IPs.

### Does Application Gateway support multiple public IPs on the gateway?

An application gateway supports only one public IP address.

### How large should I make my subnet for Application Gateway?

See [Application Gateway subnet size considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#size-of-the-subnet).

### Can I deploy more than one Application Gateway resource to a single subnet?

Yes. In addition to multiple instances of a given Application Gateway deployment, you can provision another unique Application Gateway resource to an existing subnet that contains a different Application Gateway resource.

A single subnet can't support both Standard_v2 and Standard Application Gateway together.

### Does Application Gateway support x-forwarded-for headers?

Yes. See [Modifications to a request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/how-application-gateway-works#modifications-to-the-request).

### How long does it take to deploy an application gateway? Will my application gateway work while it's being updated?

New Application Gateway v1 SKU deployments can take up to 20 minutes to provision. Changes to instance size or count aren't disruptive, and the gateway remains active during this time.

Deployments that use the v2 SKU can take up to 6 minutes to provision.

### Can I use Exchange Server as a backend with Application Gateway?

No. Application Gateway doesn't support email protocols such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3. 

## Performance

### How does Application Gateway support high availability and scalability?

The Application Gateway v1 SKU supports high-availability scenarios when you've deployed two or more instances. Azure distributes these instances across update and fault domains to ensure that instances don't all fail at the same time. The v1 SKU supports scalability by adding multiple instances of the same gateway to share the load.

The v2 SKU automatically ensures that new instances are spread across fault domains and update domains. If you choose zone redundancy, the newest instances are also spread across availability zones to offer zonal failure resiliency.

### How do I achieve a DR scenario across datacenters by using Application Gateway?

Use Traffic Manager to distribute traffic across multiple application gateways in different datacenters.

### Does Application Gateway support autoscaling?

Yes, the Application Gateway v2 SKU supports autoscaling. For more information, see [Autoscaling and Zone-redundant Application Gateway](application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant.md).

### Does manual scale up or scale down cause downtime?

No. Instances are distributed across upgrade domains and fault domains.

### Does Application Gateway support connection draining?

Yes. You can set up connection draining to change members within a backend pool without disruption. This setup allows you to continue to send existing connections to their previous destination until either that connection closes or a configurable timeout expires. Connection draining waits for only current in-flight connections to finish. Application Gateway isn't aware of the application session state.

### Can I change instance size from medium to large without disruption?

Yes. Azure distributes instances across update and fault domains to ensure that instances don't fail all at the same time. Application Gateway supports scaling by adding multiple instances of the same gateway to share the load.

## Configuration

### Is Application Gateway always deployed in a virtual network?

Yes. Application Gateway is always deployed in a virtual network subnet. This subnet can contain only application gateways. For more information, see [virtual network and subnet requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#azure-virtual-network-and-dedicated-subnet).

### Can Application Gateway communicate with instances outside of its virtual network or outside of its subscription?

As long as you have IP connectivity, Application Gateway can communicate with instances outside of the virtual network that it's in. Application Gateway can also communicate with instances outside of the subscription it's in. If you plan to use internal IPs as backend pool members, use [virtual network peering](../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md) or [Azure VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md).

### Can I deploy anything else in the application gateway subnet?

No. But you can deploy other application gateways in the subnet.

### Are network security groups supported on the application gateway subnet?

See [Network security groups in the Application Gateway subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#network-security-groups-on-the-application-gateway-subnet).

### Does the application gateway subnet support user-defined routes?

See [User-defined routes supported in the Application Gateway subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#user-defined-routes-supported-on-the-application-gateway-subnet).

### What are the limits on Application Gateway? Can I increase these limits?

See [Application Gateway limits](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md#application-gateway-limits).

### Can I simultaneously use Application Gateway for both external and internal traffic?

Yes. Application Gateway supports one internal IP and one external IP per application gateway.

### Does Application Gateway support virtual network peering?

Yes. Virtual network peering helps load-balance traffic in other virtual networks.

### Can I talk to on-premises servers when they're connected by ExpressRoute or VPN tunnels?

Yes, as long as traffic is allowed.

### Can one backend pool serve many applications on different ports?

Microservice architecture is supported. To probe on different ports, you need to configure multiple HTTP settings.

### Do custom probes support wildcards or regex on response data?

No. 

### How are routing rules processed in Application Gateway?

See [Order of processing rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#order-of-processing-rules).

### For custom probes, what does the Host field signify?

The Host field specifies the name to send the probe to when you've configured multisite on Application Gateway. Otherwise use '127.0.0.1'. This value is different from the virtual machine host name. Its format is \<protocol\>://\<host\>:\<port\>\<path\>.

### Can I allow Application Gateway access to only a few source IP addresses?

Yes. See [restrict access to specific source IPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#allow-application-gateway-access-to-a-few-source-ips).

### Can I use the same port for both public-facing and private-facing listeners?

No.

### Is there guidance available to migrate from the v1 SKU to the v2 SKU?

Yes. For details see, [Migrate Azure Application Gateway and Web Application Firewall from v1 to v2](migrate-v1-v2.md).

### How do I monitor WAF?

Monitor WAF through diagnostic logging. For more information, see [Diagnostic logging and metrics for Application Gateway](application-gateway-diagnostics.md).

### Does detection mode block traffic?

No. Detection mode only logs traffic that triggers a WAF rule.

### Can I customize WAF rules?

Yes. For more information, see [Customize WAF rule groups and rules](application-gateway-customize-waf-rules-portal.md).

### What rules are currently available for WAF?

WAF currently supports CRS [2.2.9](application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules.md#owasp229) and [3.0](application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules.md#owasp30). These rules provide baseline security against most of the top-10 vulnerabilities that Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) identifies: 

* SQL injection protection
* Cross-site scripting protection
* Protection against common web attacks such as command injection, HTTP request smuggling, HTTP response splitting, and remote file inclusion attack
* Protection against HTTP protocol violations
* Protection against HTTP protocol anomalies such as missing host user-agent and accept headers
* Prevention against bots, crawlers, and scanners
* Detection of common application misconfigurations (that is, Apache, IIS, and so on)

For more information, see [OWASP top-10 vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10#OWASP_Top_10_for_2013).

### Does WAF support DDoS protection?

Yes. You can enable DDoS protection on the virtual network where the application gateway is deployed. This setting ensures that the Azure DDoS Protection service also protects the application gateway virtual IP (VIP).

### Is there guidance available to migrate from the v1 SKU to the v2 SKU?

Yes. For details see, [Migrate Azure Application Gateway and Web Application Firewall from v1 to v2](migrate-v1-v2.md).

## Diagnostics and logging

### What types of logs does Application Gateway provide?

Application Gateway provides three logs: 

* **ApplicationGatewayAccessLog**: The access log contains each request submitted to the application gateway frontend. The data includes the caller's IP, URL requested, response latency, return code, and bytes in and out. The access log is collected every 300 seconds. It contains one record per application gateway.
* **ApplicationGatewayPerformanceLog**: The performance log captures performance information for each application gateway. Information includes the throughput in bytes, total requests served, failed request count, and healthy and unhealthy backend instance count.
* **ApplicationGatewayFirewallLog**: For application gateways that you configure with WAF, the firewall log contains requests that are logged through either detection mode or prevention mode.

For more information, see [Backend health, diagnostics logs, and metrics for Application Gateway](application-gateway-diagnostics.md).

### How do I know if my backend pool members are healthy?

Verify health by using the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-AzApplicationGatewayBackendHealth` or the portal. For more information, see [Application Gateway diagnostics](application-gateway-diagnostics.md).

### What's the retention policy for the diagnostic logs?

Diagnostic logs flow to the customer's storage account. Customers can set the retention policy based on their preference. Diagnostic logs can also be sent to an event hub or Azure Monitor logs. For more information, see [Application Gateway diagnostics](application-gateway-diagnostics.md).

### How do I get audit logs for Application Gateway?

In the portal, on the menu blade of an application gateway, select **Activity Log** to access the audit log. 

### Can I set alerts with Application Gateway?

Yes. In Application Gateway, alerts are configured on metrics. For more information, see [Application Gateway metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#metrics) and [Receive alert notifications](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-receive-alert-notifications.md).

### How do I analyze traffic statistics for Application Gateway?

You can view and analyze access logs in several ways. Use Azure Monitor logs, Excel, Power BI, and so on.

You can also use a Resource Manager template that installs and runs the popular [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) log analyzer for Application Gateway access logs. GoAccess provides valuable HTTP traffic statistics such as unique visitors, requested files, hosts, operating systems, browsers, and HTTP status codes. For more information, in GitHub, see the [Readme file in the Resource Manager template folder](https://aka.ms/appgwgoaccessreadme).

### What could cause backend health to return an unknown status?

Usually, you see an unknown status when access to the backend is blocked by a network security group (NSG), custom DNS, or user-defined routing (UDR) on the application gateway subnet. For more information, see [Backend health, diagnostics logging, and metrics for Application Gateway](application-gateway-diagnostics.md).
