# Quickstart: Direct web traffic with Azure Application Gateway - Azure CLI

This quickstart shows you how to use Azure CLI to create an application gateway.  After creating the application gateway, you test it to make sure it's working correctly. With Azure Application Gateway, you direct your application web traffic to specific resources by assigning listeners to ports, creating rules, and adding resources to a backend pool. For the sake of simplicity, this article uses a simple setup with a public front-end IP, a basic listener to host a single site on this application gateway, two virtual machines used for the backend pool, and a basic request routing rule.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

### Azure CLI

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, run Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. To find the version, run **az --version**. For information about installing or upgrading, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Resource group

In Azure, you allocate related resources to a resource group. Create a resource group by using [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create). 

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroupAG* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroupAG --location eastus
```

### Required network resources 

For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network.  The application gateway subnet can contain only application gateways. No other resources are allowed.  You can either create a new subnet for Application Gateway or use an existing one. In this example, you create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers. You can configure the Frontend IP of the Application Gateway to be Public or Private as per your use case. In this example, we will choose a Public Frontend IP.

To create the virtual network and subnet, you use [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet#az-network-vnet-create). Run [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip) to create the public IP address.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet create \
  --name myVNet \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --location eastus \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --subnet-name myAGSubnet \
  --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
az network vnet subnet create \
  --name myBackendSubnet \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --vnet-name myVNet   \
  --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24
az network public-ip create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --name myAGPublicIPAddress
```

### Backend servers

Backend can be composed of NICs, virtual machine scale sets, public IPs, internal IPs, fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and multi-tenant back-ends like Azure App Service. In this example, you create two virtual machines for Azure to use as backend servers for the application gateway. You also install IIS on the virtual machines to verify that Azure successfully created the application gateway.

#### Create two virtual machines

Install the [NGINX web server](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/) on the virtual machines to verify the application gateway was successfully created. You can use a cloud-init configuration file to install NGINX and run a "Hello World" Node.js app on a Linux virtual machine. For more information about cloud-init, see [Cloud-init support for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init).

In your Azure Cloud Shell, copy and paste the following configuration into a file named *cloud-init.txt*. Enter *editor cloud-init.txt* to create the file.

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - nginx
  - nodejs
  - npm
write_files:
  - owner: www-data:www-data
  - path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    content: |
      server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
      }
  - owner: azureuser:azureuser
  - path: /home/azureuser/myapp/index.js
    content: |
      var express = require('express')
      var app = express()
      var os = require('os');
      app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('Hello World from host ' + os.hostname() + '!')
      })
      app.listen(3000, function () {
        console.log('Hello world app listening on port 3000!')
      })
runcmd:
  - service nginx restart
  - cd "/home/azureuser/myapp"
  - npm init
  - npm install express -y
  - nodejs index.js
```

Create the network interfaces with [az network nic create](/cli/azure/network/nic#az-network-nic-create). To create the virtual machines, you use [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create).

```azurecli-interactive
for i in `seq 1 2`; do
  az network nic create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
    --name myNic$i \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --subnet myBackendSubnet
  az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
    --name myVM$i \
    --nics myNic$i \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --custom-data cloud-init.txt
done
```

## Create the application gateway

Create an application gateway by using [az network application-gateway create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway). When you create an application gateway with the Azure CLI, you specify configuration information, such as capacity, SKU, and HTTP settings. Azure then adds the private IP addresses of the network interfaces as servers in the backend pool of the application gateway.

```azurecli-interactive
address1=$(az network nic show --name myNic1 --resource-group myResourceGroupAG | grep "\"privateIpAddress\":" | grep -oE '[^ ]+$' | tr -d '",')
address2=$(az network nic show --name myNic2 --resource-group myResourceGroupAG | grep "\"privateIpAddress\":" | grep -oE '[^ ]+$' | tr -d '",')
az network application-gateway create \
  --name myAppGateway \
  --location eastus \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --capacity 2 \
  --sku Standard_Medium \
  --http-settings-cookie-based-affinity Enabled \
  --public-ip-address myAGPublicIPAddress \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet myAGSubnet \
  --servers "$address1" "$address2"
```

It can take up to 30 minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. After it's created, you can view the following settings in the **Settings** section of the **Application gateway** page:

- **appGatewayBackendPool**: Located on the **Backend pools** page. It specifies the required backend pool.
- **appGatewayBackendHttpSettings**: Located on the **HTTP settings** page. It specifies that the application gateway uses port 80 and the HTTP protocol for communication.
- **appGatewayHttpListener**: Located on the **Listeners page**. It specifies the default listener associated with **appGatewayBackendPool**.
- **appGatewayFrontendIP**: Located on the **Frontend IP configurations** page. It assigns *myAGPublicIPAddress* to **appGatewayHttpListener**.
- **rule1**: Located on the **Rules** page. It specifies the default routing rule that's associated with **appGatewayHttpListener**.

## Test the application gateway

Although Azure doesn't require an NGINX web server to create the application gateway, you installed it in this quickstart to verify whether Azure successfully created the application gateway. To get the public IP address of the new application gateway, use [az network public-ip show](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-show). 

```azurepowershell-interactive
az network public-ip show \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --name myAGPublicIPAddress \
  --query [ipAddress] \
  --output tsv
```

Copy and paste the public IP address into the address bar of your browser.
â€‹    
![Test application gateway](./media/quick-create-cli/application-gateway-nginxtest.png)

When you refresh the browser, you should see the name of the second VM. A valid response verifies that the application gateway was successfully created and it is able to successfully connect with the backend.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources that you created with the application gateway, use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to remove the resource group. By removing the resource group, you also remove the application gateway and all its related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroupAG
```
