The following sections describe the capabilities of these application templates:

## Connected logistics

Global logistics spending is expected to reach $10.6 trillion in 2020. Transportation of goods accounts for the majority of this spending and shipping providers are under intense competitive pressure and constraints.

You can use IoT sensors to collect and monitor ambient conditions such as temperature, humidity, tilt, shock, light, and the location of a shipment. You can combine telemetry gathered from IoT sensors and devices with other data sources such as weather and traffic information in cloud-based business intelligence systems.

The benefits of a connected logistics solution include:

* Shipment monitoring with real-time tracing and tracking. 
* Shipment integrity with real-time ambient condition monitoring.
* Security from theft, loss, or damage of shipments.
* Geo-fencing, route optimization, fleet management, and vehicle analytics.
* Forecasting for predictable departure and arrival of shipments.

The following screenshots show the out-of-the-box dashboard in the application template. The dashboard is fully customizable to meet your specific solution requirements:

## Digital distribution center

As manufacturers and retailers establish worldwide presences, their supply chains branch out and become more complex. Consumers now expect large selections of products to be available, and for those goods to arrive within one or two days of purchase. Distribution centers must adapt to these trends while overcoming existing inefficiencies.

Today, reliance on manual labor means that picking and packing accounts for 55-65% of distribution center costs. Manual picking and packing are also typically slower than automated systems, and rapidly fluctuating staffing needs make it even harder to meet shipping volumes. This seasonal fluctuation results in high staff turnover and increase the likelihood of costly errors.

Solutions based on IoT enabled cameras can deliver transformational benefits by enabling a digital feedback loop. Data from across the distribution center leads to actionable insights that, in turn, results in better data.

The benefits of a digital distribution center include:

* Cameras monitor goods as they arrive and move through the conveyor system.
* Automatic identification of faulty goods.
* Efficient order tracking.
* Reduced costs, improved productivity, and optimized usage.

## Smart inventory management

Inventory is the stock of goods a retailer holds. Inventory management is critical to ensure the right product is in the right place at the right time. A retailer must balance the costs of storing too much inventory against the costs of not having sufficient items in stock to meet demand.

IoT data generated from radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, beacons, and cameras provide opportunities to improve inventory management processes. You can combine telemetry gathered from IoT sensors and devices with other data sources such as weather and traffic information in cloud-based business intelligence systems.

The benefits of smart inventory management include:

* Reducing the risk of items being out of stock and ensuring the desired customer service level. 
* In-depth analysis and insights into inventory accuracy in near real time.
* Tools to help decide on the right amount of inventory to hold to meet customer orders.
