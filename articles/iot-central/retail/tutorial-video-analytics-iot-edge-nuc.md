# Tutorial: Create an IoT Edge instance for video analytics (Intel NUC)

Azure IoT Edge is a fully managed service that delivers cloud intelligence locally by deploying and running:

* Custom logic
* Azure services
* Artificial intelligence

In IoT Edge, these services run directly on cross-platform IoT devices, enabling you to run your IoT solution securely and at scale in the cloud or offline.

This tutorial shows you how to install and configure the IoT Edge runtime on an Intel NUC device.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Update and configure IoT Edge
> * Setup the IoT Edge gateway
> * Connect a local ONVIF-compatible camera to your Intel NUC device

## Prerequisites

* Before you start, you should complete the previous [Create a live video analytics application in Azure IoT Central (YOLO v3)](./tutorial-video-analytics-create-app-yolo-v3.md) or [Create a video analytics in Azure IoT Central (OpenVINO&trade;)](tutorial-video-analytics-create-app-openvino.md)tutorial.
* A device, such as an Intel NUC, running Linux, that can run Docker containers, and has enough processing power to run video analytics.
* The [IoT Edge runtime installed](../../iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux.md) and running on the device.
* Be able to connect to the IoT Edge device from your Windows machine, you need the [PuTTY SSH client](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or an equivalent utility.
* You also need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create one for free on the [Azure sign-up page](https://aka.ms/createazuresubscription).

## Configure the IoT Edge device

If you don't have the IoT Edge runtime installed in your Intel NUC machine, see [Install the Azure IoT Edge runtime on Debian-based Linux systems](../../iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux.md) instructions.

To update the IoT Edge runtime:

1. Use the PuTTY utility to connect to the IoT Edge device.

1. Run the following commands to update and check the version of the IoT Edge runtime. At the time of writing, the version is 1.0.9:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libiothsm iotedge
    sudo iotedge --version
    ```

1. Use the following commands to create the folders the deployment uses with the necessary permissions:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /data/storage
    sudo mkdir -p /data/media
    sudo chmod -R 777 /data
    ```

To add the *state.json* configuration file to the */data/storage* folder on your IoT Edge device:

1. Use a text editor to open the *state.json* file in the *lva-configuration* folder on your local machine.

1. Update the `system` and `iotCentral > properties` placeholders with string values that describe your gateway device. You can view these values later in the IoT Central application dashboard.

1. Update the `iotCentral > appKeys` placeholders with the values you made a note of in the *scratchpad.txt* file in the previous tutorial. Save the changes.

1. Use the PuTTY `scp` utility in a command prompt to copy the *state.json* file you just edited to */data/storage* folder on your IoT Edge device. This example uses `192.168.0.144` as an example IP address, replace it with the IP address of your IoT Edge device:

    ```cmd
    scp state.json YourUserName@192.168.0.144:/data/storage/state.json`
    ```

Configure IoT Edge to register and connect to your IoT Central application:

1. Use the PuTTY utility to connect to the IoT Edge device.

1. Use a text editor, such as `nano`, to open the IoT Edge config.yaml file.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > YAML files can't use tabs for indentation, use two spaces instead. Top-level items can't have leading whitespace.

1. Scroll down until you see `# Manual provisioning configuration`. Comment out the next three lines as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    # Manual provisioning configuration
    #provisioning:
    #  source: "manual"
    #  device_connection_string: "temp"
    ```

1. Scroll down until you see `# DPS symmetric key provisioning configuration`. Uncomment the next eight lines as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    # DPS symmetric key provisioning configuration
    provisioning:
      source: "dps"
      global_endpoint: "https://global.azure-devices-provisioning.net"
      scope_id: "{scope_id}"
      attestation:
        method: "symmetric_key"
        registration_id: "{registration_id}"
        symmetric_key: "{symmetric_key}"
    ```

1. Replace `{scope_id}` with the **ID Scope** you made a note of in the *scratchpad.txt* file in the previous tutorial.

1. Replace `{registration_id}` with *lva-gateway-001*, the device you created in the previous tutorial.

1. Replace `{symmetric_key}` with the **Primary key** for the **lva-gateway-001** device you made a note of in the *scratchpad.txt* file in the previous tutorial.

1. Run the following command to restart the IoT Edge daemon:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart iotedge
    ```

1. To check the status of the IoT Edge modules, run the following command:

    ```bash
    iotedge list
    ```

    The output from the pervious command shows five running modules. You can also view the status of the running modules in your IoT Central application.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can rerun this command to check on the status. You may need to wait for all the modules to start running.

If the IoT Edge modules don't start correctly, see [Troubleshoot your IoT Edge device](../../iot-edge/troubleshoot.md).

## Collect the RSTP stream from your camera

Identify the RTSP stream URLs for the cameras connected to your IoT Edge device, for example:

`rtsp://192.168.1.64:554/Streaming/Channels/101/`

> [!TIP]
> Try to view the camera stream on the IoT Edge computer using a media player such as VLC.

## Next steps

You've now deployed the IoT Edge runtime and the LVA modules to the Intel NUC gateway device.

To manage the cameras, follow the next tutorial:
