## Customize image tiles on the dashboard
An Azure IoT Central application dashboard consists of one or more tiles. A tile is a rectangular container for displaying content on a dashboard. You associate various types of content with tiles, and you drag, drop, and resize tiles to customize a dashboard layout. There are several types of tiles for displaying content. Image tiles contain images, and you can add a URL that enables users to click the image. Label tiles display plain text. Markdown tiles contain formatted content and let you set an image, a URL, a title, and markdown code that renders as HTML. Telemetry, property, or command tiles display device-specific data. 

In this section, you learn how to customize image tiles on the dashboard.

To customize the image tile that displays a brand image on the dashboard:

1. Select **Edit** on the dashboard toolbar. 

1. Select **Configure** on the image tile that displays the Northwind brand image. 

    ![Azure IoT Central edit brand image](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-customize-dashboard-pnp/brand-image-edit.png)

1. Change the **Title**. The title appears when a user hovers over the image.

1. Select **Image**. A dialog opens and enables you to upload a custom image. 

1. Optionally, specify a URL for the image.

1. Select **Update configuration**. The **Update configuration** button saves changes to the dashboard and leaves edit mode enabled.

    ![Azure IoT Central save brand image](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-customize-dashboard-pnp/brand-image-save.png)

    ![Azure IoT Central store zones](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-customize-dashboard-pnp/store-zones.png)

1. Select **Save**. 

## Arrange tiles to modify the layout
A key step in customizing a dashboard is to rearrange the tiles to create a useful view. Application operators use the dashboard to visualize device telemetry, manage devices, and monitor conditions in a store. Azure IoT Central simplifies the application builder task of creating a dashboard. The dashboard edit mode enables you to quickly add, move, resize, and delete tiles. The **In-store analytics - checkout** application template also simplifies the task of creating a dashboard. It provides a working dashboard layout, with sensors connected, and tiles that display checkout line counts and environmental conditions.

In this section, you rearrange the dashboard in the **In-store analytics - checkout** application template to create a custom layout.

To remove tiles that you don't plan to use in your application:

1. Select **Edit** on the dashboard toolbar. 

1. Select **X Delete** to remove the following tiles: **Back to all zones**, **Visit store dashboard**, **Wait time**, and all three tiles associated with **Checkout 3**. The Contoso store dashboard does not use these tiles. 

    ![Azure IoT Central delete tiles](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-customize-dashboard-pnp/delete-tiles.png)

1. Scroll to bring the remaining dashboard tiles into view.

1. Select **X Delete** to remove the following tiles: **Warm-up checkout zone**, **Cool-down checkout zone**, **Occupancy sensor settings**, **Thermostat sensor settings**, and **Environment conditions**. 

   ![Azure IoT Central delete remaining tiles](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-customize-dashboard-pnp/delete-tiles-2.png)

1. Select **Save**. Removing unused tiles frees up space in the edit page, and simplifies the dashboard view for operators.

1. View your changes to the dashboard.

   ![Azure IoT Central after deleting tiles](./media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-customize-dashboard-pnp/after-delete-tiles.png)

After you remove unused tiles, rearrange the remaining tiles to create an organized layout. The new layout includes space for tiles you add in a later step.

To rearrange the remaining tiles:

1. Select **Edit**.

1. Select the **Occupancy firmware** tile and drag it to the right of the **Occupancy** battery tile.

1. Select the **Thermostat firmware** tile and drag it to the right of the **Thermostat** battery tile.
