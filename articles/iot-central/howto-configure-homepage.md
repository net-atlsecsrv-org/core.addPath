# Configure the application dashboard

The **Dashboard** is the page that loads when users who have access to the application navigate to the application's URL. If you selected either the **Sample Contoso** or **Sample Devkits** application template to create your application, your application has a pre-defined dashboard. If you chose the **Custom Application** application template, your dashboard is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> Users can also [create their own personal dashboards](howto-personalize-dashboard.md) to use instead of the default application dashboard.

## Add tiles

The following screenshot shows the dashboard in an application created from the **Sample Contoso** template. To customize the default dashboard for your application, select **Edit** at the top right of the page.

Selecting **Edit**, opens the dashboard library panel. The library contains the tiles and dashboard primitives you can use to customize the dashboard.

For example, you can add a **Device Settings and Properties** tile to show a selection of the current settings and properties values for a device. To do so, first select a **Device Template** then select a **Device Instance**. After that give the tile a title and select a **Setting** or a **Property** to display. The following screenshot shows settings and properties selected to add to the tile. Select **Done** to save the change to the dashboard.

Now when an operator views the default application dashboard, they see the new tile with the **Set Temperature** setting for the device:

You can explore other tile types in the library to discover how to further customize the default application dashboard.
