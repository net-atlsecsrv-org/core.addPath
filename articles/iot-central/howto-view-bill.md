# View your bill in IoT Central application

This article describes how, as an administrator, you can view your bill in Azure IoT Central application in the administration section and also how you can convert your trial version to pay-as-you-go.

To access and use the **Administration** section, you must be in the **Administrator** role for an Azure IoT Central application. If you create an Azure IoT Central application, you're automatically assigned to the **Administrator** role for that application.

## View your bill

To view your bill, go to the **Billing** page in the **Administration** section. The Azure billing page opens in a new tab, where you can see the bill for each of your Azure IoT Central applications.

## Convert your Trial to Pay-As-You-Go

- **Trial** applications are free for seven days before they expire. They can be converted to Pay-As-You-Go at any time before they expire.
- **Pay-As-You-Go** applications are charged per device, with the first five devices free, per subscription.

Learn more about pricing on the [Azure IoT Central pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-central/).

In the billing section, you can convert your trial applications into pay-as-you-go.

To complete this self-service process, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Billing** page in the **Administration** section.

1. After you select **Convert**, your application is now a Pay-As-You-Go application and you start getting billed.
