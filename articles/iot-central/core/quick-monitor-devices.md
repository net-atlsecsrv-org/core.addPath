# Quickstart: Use Azure IoT Central to monitor your devices

*This article applies to operators, builders, and administrators.*

This quickstart shows you, as an operator, how to use your Microsoft Azure IoT Central application to monitor your devices and change settings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should complete the three previous quickstarts [Create an Azure IoT Central application](./quick-deploy-iot-central.md), [Add a simulated device to your IoT Central application](./quick-create-simulated-device.md) and [Configure rules and actions for your device](quick-configure-rules.md).

## Receive a notification

Azure IoT Central sends notifications about devices as email messages. As a builder, you added a rule to send a notification to an operator when the humidity in a connected device sensor exceeded a threshold. As an operator, you check your emails for notifications.

Open the email message you received at the end of the [Configure rules and actions for your device](quick-configure-rules.md) quickstart. In the email, select the link to the device:

The **Overview** view for the simulated device you created in the previous quickstarts opens in your browser:

## Investigate an issue

As an operator, you can view information about the device on the **Overview**, **About**, and **Commands** views. The builder created a **Manage device** view for you to edit device information and set device properties.

The chart on the dashboard shows a plot of the device humidity. You decide that the device humidity is too high.

## Remediate an issue

To make a change to the device, use the **Manage device** page.

Change **Target temperature** to 80 to warm the device and reduce the humidity. Choose **Save** to update the device. When the device confirms the settings change, the status of the property changes to **synced**:

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to:

* Receive a notification
* Investigate an issue
* Remediate an issue

Now that you know now to monitor your device, the suggested next step is to:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Build and manage a device template](howto-set-up-template.md).
