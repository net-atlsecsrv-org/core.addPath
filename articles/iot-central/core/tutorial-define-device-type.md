# Tutorial: Define a new device type in your Azure IoT Central application

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-original-pnp](../../../includes/iot-central-original-pnp-note.md)]

This tutorial shows you, as a builder, how to use a device template to define a new type of device in your Microsoft Azure IoT Central application. A device template defines the telemetry, state, properties, and settings for your device type.

To enable you to test your application before you connect a real device, IoT Central generates a simulated device from the device template when you create it.

In this tutorial, you create a **Connected Air Conditioner** device template. A connected air conditioner device:

* Sends telemetry such as temperature and humidity.
* Reports state such as whether it's on or off.
* Has device properties such as firmware version and serial number.
* Has settings such as target temperature.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * View simulated events
> * Define state measurement
> * View simulated state
> * Use settings and properties
> * Use commands
> * View your simulated device in the dashboard

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure IoT Central application created from the **Custom application** template. If you don't have an application, complete the [Create an Azure IoT Central application](quick-deploy-iot-central.md) quickstart, making sure you choose the **Custom application** template.

## Create a device template

As a builder, you can create and edit the device templates in your application. When you create a device template, Azure IoT Central generates a simulated device from the template. The simulated device generates telemetry that enables you to test the behavior of your application before you connect a real device.

To add a new device template to your application, you need to go to the **Device Templates** page. To do so select the **Device Templates** on the left pane.

![Device Templates page](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/devicetemplates.png)

## Add a device template

The following steps show you how to create a new **Connected Air Conditioner** device template for devices that send temperature telemetry to your application:

1. On the **Device Templates** page, select **+ New**:

    ![Device Templates page, Create Device Template](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/newtemplate.png)

2. The page shows the templates you can choose from.

    ![Device Template Library](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/devicetemplatelibrary.png)

3. Select the **Custom**, enter **Connected Air Conditioner** as the name of your device template, and then select **Create**. You can also upload an image of your device that's visible to operators in the device explorer:

    ![Custom Device](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/createcustomdevice.png)

4. In the **Connected Air Conditioner** device template, make sure you're on the **Measurements** tab where you define the telemetry. Each device template you define has separate tabs for you to:

   * Specify the _measurements_, such as telemetry, event, and state, sent by the device.

   * Define the _settings_ used to control the device.

   * Define the _properties_ that are the device metadata.

   * Define the _commands_ to be run directly on the device.

   * Define the _rules_ associated with the device.

   * Customize the device _dashboard_ for your operators.

     > [!NOTE]
     > To change the name of the device template, select the template name at the top of the page.

5. To add the temperature telemetry measurement, select **+ New Measurement**. Then choose **Telemetry** as the measurement type:

    ![Connected air conditioner measurements](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/airconmeasurementsnew.png)

6. Each type of telemetry you define for a device template includes [configuration options](howto-set-up-template.md) such as:

   * Display options.

   * Details of the telemetry.

   * Simulation parameters.

     To configure your **Temperature** telemetry, use the information in the following table:

     | Setting              | Value         |
     | -------------------- | -----------   |
     | Display Name         | Temperature   |
     | Field Name           | temperature   |
     | Units                | F             |
     | Min                  | 60            |
     | Max                  | 110           |
     | Decimal places       | 0             |

     You can also choose a color for the telemetry display. To save the telemetry definition, select **Save**:

     ![Configure Temperature simulation](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/temperaturesimulation.png)

7. After a short while, the **Measurements** tab shows a chart of the temperature telemetry from your simulated connected air conditioner device. Use the controls to manage visibility, aggregation, or to edit the telemetry definition:
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > For telemetry, **Average** is set as the default aggregation. 

    ![View temperature simulation](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/viewsimulation.png)

8. You can also customize the chart using the **Line**, **Stacked**, and **Edit Time Range** controls:

    ![Customize the chart](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/customizechart.png)

## Add an event measurement

Use events to define point-in-time data that the device sends when there's an event such as an error or a component failure. Azure IoT Central can simulate device events to enable you to test the behavior of your application before you connect a real device. Define event measurements for your device template in the **Measurements** view.

1. To add the **Fan Motor Error** event measurement, select **+ New Measurement**. Then choose **Event** as the measurement type:

    ![Connected air conditioner measurements](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/eventnew.png)

2. Each type of Event you define for a device template includes [configuration options](howto-set-up-template.md) such as:

   * Display Name.

   * Field Name.

   * Severity.

     To configure your **Fan Motor Error** event, use the information in the following table:

     | Setting              | Value             |
     | -------------------- | -----------       |
     | Display Name         | Fan Motor Error   |
     | Field Name           | fanmotorerr       |
     | Severity             | Error             |

     To save the event definition, select **Save**:

     ![Configure Event measurement](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/eventconfiguration.png)

3. After a short while, the **Measurements** tab shows a chart of the events randomly generated from your simulated connected air conditioner device. Use the controls to manage visibility, or to edit the event definition:

    ![View event simulation](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/eventview.png)

1. To see additional details about the event, select the event on the chart:

    ![View Event Details](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/eventviewdetail.png)

## Define a state measurement

You can use state to define and visualize the state of the device or its component over a period of time. Azure IoT Central can simulate device state to enable you to test the behavior of your application before you connect a real device. You define state measurements for your device type in the **Measurements** view.

1. To add a **Fan Mode** state measurement, select **+ New Measurement**. Then choose **State** as the measurement type:

    ![Connected air conditioner state measurements](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/statenew.png)

2. Each type of state you define for a device template includes [configuration options](howto-set-up-template.md) such as:

   * Display Name.

   * Field Name.

   * Values with optional display labels.

   * Color for each value.

     To configure your **Fan Mode** state, use the information in the following table:

     | Setting              | Value             |
     | -------------------- | -----------       |
     | Display Name         | Fan Mode          |
     | Field Name           | fanmode           |
     | Value                | 1                 |
     | Display label        | Operating         |
     | Value                | 0                 |
     | Display label        | Stopped           |

     To save the state measurement definition, select **Save**:

     ![Configure State measurement](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/stateconfiguration.png)

3. After a short while, the **Measurements** tab shows a chart of the states randomly generated from your simulated connected air conditioner device. Use the controls to manage visibility, or to edit the state definition:

    ![View state simulation](./media/tutorial-define-device-type/stateview.png)

4. If there are too many data points sent by the device within a small duration, the state measurement is shown with a different visual. Select the chart to see all the data points within that time period are displayed in chronological order. You can also narrow the time range so see the measurements in more detail.

## Settings, properties, and commands

Settings, properties, and commands are different values defined in a device template and associated with each individual device:

* You use _settings_ to send configuration data to a device from your application. For example, an operator could use a setting to change the device's telemetry interval from two seconds to five seconds. When an operator changes a setting, the setting is marked as pending in the UI until the device responds with an acknowledgment.

* You use _properties_ to define metadata that's associated with your device. There are two categories of properties:
    
  * You use _application properties_ to record information about your device in your application. For example, you can use application properties to record a device's location and its last service date. These properties are stored in the application and don't synchronize with the device. An operator can assign values to properties.

  * You use _device properties_ to enable a device to send property values to your application. These properties can only be changed by the device. For an operator, device properties are read-only. In this scenario of a connected air conditioner, the firmware version and device serial number are device properties reported by the device.
    
    For more information, see [Properties](howto-set-up-template.md#properties) in the how-to guide on setting up a device template.

* You use _commands_ to remotely manage your device from your application. You can directly run commands on the device from the cloud to control the devices. For example, an operator can run commands such as reboot, to instantly reboot the device.

## Use settings

You use *settings* to enable an operator to send configuration data to a device. In this section, you add a setting to your **Connected Air Conditioner** device template that enables an operator to set the target temperature of the connected air conditioner.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab for your **Connected Air Conditioner** device template.

2. You can create settings of different types such as numbers or text. Select **Number** to add a number setting to your device.

3. To configure your **Set Temperature** setting, use the information in the following table:

    | Field                | Value           |
    | -------------------- | -----------     |
    | Display Name         | Set Temperature |
    | Field Name           | setTemperature  |
    | Unit of Measure      | F               |
    | Decimal Places       | 1               |
