# Extend Azure IoT Central with custom rules using Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, and SendGrid

This how-to guide shows you how to extend your IoT Central application with custom rules and notifications. The example shows sending a notification to an operator when a device stops sending telemetry. The solution uses an [Azure Stream Analytics](../../stream-analytics/index.yml) query to detect when a device has stopped sending telemetry. The Stream Analytics job uses [Azure Functions](../../azure-functions/index.yml) to send notification emails using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/partners/microsoft-azure/).

This how-to guide shows you how to extend IoT Central beyond what it can already do with the built-in rules and actions.

In this how-to guide, you learn how to:

* Stream telemetry from an IoT Central application using *continuous data export*.
* Create a Stream Analytics query that detects when a device has stopped sending data.
* Send an email notification using the Azure Functions and SendGrid services.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this how-to guide, you need an active Azure subscription.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

### IoT Central application

Create an IoT Central application on the [Azure IoT Central application manager](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) website with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Pricing plan | Standard |
| Application template | In-store analytics â€“ condition monitoring |
| Application name | Accept the default or choose your own name |
| URL | Accept the default or choose your own unique URL prefix |
| Directory | Your Azure Active Directory tenant |
| Azure subscription | Your Azure subscription |
| Region | Your nearest region |

The examples and screenshots in this article use the **United States** region. Choose a location close to you and make sure you create all your resources in the same region.

This application template includes two simulated thermostat devices that send telemetry.

### Resource group

Use the [Azure portal to create a resource group](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ResourceGroup) called **DetectStoppedDevices** to contain the other resources you create. Create your Azure resources in the same location as your IoT Central application.

### Event Hubs namespace

Use the [Azure portal to create an Event Hubs namespace](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.EventHub) with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Name    | Choose your namespace name |
| Pricing tier | Basic |
| Subscription | Your subscription |
| Resource group | DetectStoppedDevices |
| Location | East US |
| Throughput Units | 1 |

### Stream Analytics job

Use the [Azure portal to create a Stream Analytics job](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StreamAnalyticsJob)  with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Name    | Choose your job name |
| Subscription | Your subscription |
| Resource group | DetectStoppedDevices |
| Location | East US |
| Hosting environment | Cloud |
| Streaming units | 3 |

### Function app

Use the [Azure portal to create a function app](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.FunctionApp) with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| App name    | Choose your function app name |
| Subscription | Your subscription |
| Resource group | DetectStoppedDevices |
| OS | Windows |

### SendGrid account and API Keys

If you don't have a Sendgrid account, create a [free account](https://app.sendgrid.com/) before you begin.

1. From the Sendgrid Dashboard Settings on the left menu, select **API Keys**.
1. Click **Create API Key.**
1. Name the new API key **AzureFunctionAccess.**
1. Click **Create & View**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/sendgrid-api-keys.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create SendGrid API key.":::

Afterwards, you will be given an API key. Save this string for later use.

## Create an event hub

You can configure an IoT Central application to continuously export telemetry to an event hub. In this section, you create an event hub to receive telemetry from your IoT Central application. The event hub delivers the telemetry to your Stream Analytics job for processing.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Event Hubs namespace and select **+ Event Hub**.
1. Name your event hub **centralexport**, and select **Create**.

Your Event Hubs namespace looks like the following screenshot: 

```:::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/event-hubs-namespace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Event Hubs namespace." border="false":::

## Define the function

This solution uses an Azure Functions app to send an email notification when the Stream Analytics job detects a stopped device. To create your function app:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **App Service** instance in the **DetectStoppedDevices** resource group.
1. Select **+** to create a new function.
1. Select **HTTP Trigger**.
1. Select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/add-function.png" alt-text="Image of the Default HTTP trigger function"::: 

## Edit code for HTTP Trigger

The portal creates a default function called **HttpTrigger1**:

```:::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/default-function.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Edit HTTP trigger function.":::

1. Replace the C# code with the following code:

    ```csharp
    #r "Newtonsoft.Json"
    #r "SendGrid"
    using System;
    using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
    using Newtonsoft.Json;

    public static SendGridMessage Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
    {
        string requestBody = new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEnd();
        log.LogInformation(requestBody);
        var notifications = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IList<Notification>>(requestBody);

        SendGridMessage message = new SendGridMessage();
        message.Subject = "Contoso device notification";

        var content = "The following device(s) have stopped sending telemetry:<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Device ID</th><th>Time</th></tr>";
        foreach(var notification in notifications) {
            log.LogInformation($"No message received - Device: {notification.deviceid}, Time: {notification.time}");
            content += $"<tr><td>{notification.deviceid}</td><td>{notification.time}</td></tr>";
        }
        content += "</table>";
        message.AddContent("text/html", content);  

        return message;
    }

    public class Notification
    {
        public string deviceid { get; set; }
        public string time { get; set; }
    }
    ```

    You may see an error message until you save the new code.
1. Select **Save** to save the function.

## Add SendGrid Key

To add your SendGrid API Key, you need to add it to your **Function Keys** as follows:

1. Select **Function Keys**.
1. Choose **+ New Function Key**.
1. Enter the *Name* and *Value* of the API Key you created before.
1. Click **OK.**

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/add-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add Sangrid Key.":::


## Configure HttpTrigger function to use SendGrid

To send emails with SendGrid, you need to configure the bindings for your function as follows:

1. Select **Integrate**.
1. Choose **Add Output** under **HTTP ($return)**.
1. Select **Delete.**
1. Choose **+ New Output**.
1. For Binding Type, then choose **SendGrid**.
1. For SendGrid API Key Setting Type, click New.
1. Enter the *Name* and *Value* of your SendGrid API key.
1. Add the following information:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Message parameter name | Choose your name |
| To address | Choose the name of your To Address |
| From address | Choose the name of your From Address |
| Message subject | Enter your subject header |
| Message text | Enter the message from your integration |

1. Select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/add-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add SandGrid Output.":::


### Test the function works

To test the function in the portal, first choose **Logs** at the bottom of the code editor. Then choose **Test** to the right of the code editor. Use the following JSON as the **Request body**:

```json
[{"deviceid":"test-device-1","time":"2019-05-02T14:23:39.527Z"},{"deviceid":"test-device-2","time":"2019-05-02T14:23:50.717Z"},{"deviceid":"test-device-3","time":"2019-05-02T14:24:28.919Z"}]
```

The function log messages appear in the **Logs** panel:

```:::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/function-app-logs.png" alt-text="Function log output":::

After a few minutes, the **To** email address receives an email with the following content:

```txt
The following device(s) have stopped sending telemetry:

Device ID    Time
test-device-1    2019-05-02T14:23:39.527Z
test-device-2    2019-05-02T14:23:50.717Z
test-device-3    2019-05-02T14:24:28.919Z
```

## Add Stream Analytics query

This solution uses a Stream Analytics query to detect when a device stops sending telemetry for more than 120 seconds. The query uses the telemetry from the event hub as its input. The job sends the  query results to the function app. In this section, you configure the Stream Analytics job:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Stream Analytics job, under **Jobs topology** select **Inputs**, choose **+ Add stream input**, and then choose **Event Hub**.
1. Use the information in the following table to configure the input using the event hub you created previously, then choose **Save**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Input alias | centraltelemetry |
    | Subscription | Your subscription |
    | Event Hub namespace | Your Event Hub namespace |
    | Event Hub name | Use existing - **centralexport** |

1. Under **Jobs topology**, select **Outputs**, choose **+ Add**, and then choose **Azure Function**.
1. Use the information in the following table to configure the output, then choose **Save**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Output alias | emailnotification |
    | Subscription | Your subscription |
    | Function app | Your function app |
    | Function  | HttpTrigger1 |

1. Under **Jobs topology**, select **Query** and replace the existing query with the following SQL:

    ```sql
    with
    LeftSide as
    (
        SELECT
        -- Get the device ID from the message metadata and create a column
        GetMetadataPropertyValue([centraltelemetry], '[EventHub].[IoTConnectionDeviceId]') as deviceid1, 
        EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS time1
        FROM
        -- Use the event enqueued time for time-based operations
        [centraltelemetry] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
    ),
    RightSide as
    (
        SELECT
        -- Get the device ID from the message metadata and create a column
        GetMetadataPropertyValue([centraltelemetry], '[EventHub].[IoTConnectionDeviceId]') as deviceid2, 
        EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS time2
        FROM
        -- Use the event enqueued time for time-based operations
        [centraltelemetry] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
    )

    SELECT
        LeftSide.deviceid1 as deviceid,
        LeftSide.time1 as time
    INTO
        [emailnotification]
    FROM
        LeftSide
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
        RightSide 
        ON
        LeftSide.deviceid1=RightSide.deviceid2 AND DATEDIFF(second,LeftSide,RightSide) BETWEEN 1 AND 120
        where
        -- Find records where a device didn't send a message 120 seconds
        RightSide.deviceid2 is NULL
    ```

1. Select **Save**.
1. To start the Stream Analytics job, choose **Overview**, then **Start**, then **Now**, and then **Start**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/stream-analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Stream Analytics.":::

## Configure export in IoT Central 

On the [Azure IoT Central application manager](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) website, navigate to the IoT Central application you created.

In this section, you configure the application to stream the telemetry from its simulated devices to your event hub. To configure the export:

1. Navigate to the **Data Export** page, select **+ New**, and then **Azure Event Hubs**.
1. Use the following settings to configure the export, then select **Save**: 

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Display Name | Export to Event Hubs |
    | Enabled | On |
    | Type of data to export | Telemetry |
    | Enrichments | Enter desired key / Value of how you want the exported data to be organized | 
    | Destination | Create New and enter information for where the data will be exported |

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-custom-rules/cde-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data Export.":::

Wait until the export status is **Running** before you continue.

## Test

To test the solution, you can disable the continuous data export from IoT Central to simulated stopped devices:

1. In your IoT Central application, navigate to the **Data Export** page and select the **Export to Event Hubs** export configuration.
1. Set **Enabled** to **Off** and choose **Save**.
1. After at least two minutes, the **To** email address receives one or more emails that look like the following example content:

    ```txt
    The following device(s) have stopped sending telemetry:

    Device ID         Time
    Thermostat-Zone1  2019-11-01T12:45:14.686Z
    ```

## Tidy up

To tidy up after this how-to and avoid unnecessary costs, delete the **DetectStoppedDevices** resource group in the Azure portal.

You can delete the IoT Central application from the **Management** page within the application.

## Next steps

In this how-to guide, you learned how to:

* Stream telemetry from an IoT Central application using *continuous data export*.
* Create a Stream Analytics query that detects when a device has stopped sending data.
* Send an email notification using the Azure Functions and SendGrid services.

Now that you know how to create custom rules and notifications, the suggested next step is to learn how to [Extend Azure IoT Central with custom analytics](howto-create-custom-analytics.md).
