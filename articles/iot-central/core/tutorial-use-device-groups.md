# Tutorial: Use device groups to analyze device telemetry

This article describes how, as an operator, to use device groups to analyze device telemetry in your Azure IoT Central application.

A device group is a list of devices that are grouped together because they match some specified criteria. Device groups help you manage, visualize, and analyze devices at scale by grouping devices into smaller, logical groups. For example, you can create a device group to list all the air conditioner devices in Seattle to enable a technician to find the devices for which they're responsible.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should complete the [Create an Azure IoT Central application](./quick-deploy-iot-central.md) and [Add a simulated device to your IoT Central application](./quick-create-pnp-device.md) quickstarts to create the **MXChip IoT DevKit** device template to work with.

## Create simulated devices

Before you create a device group, add at least five simulated devices from the **MXChip IoT DevKit** device template to use in this tutorial:

![Five simulated sensor devices](./media/tutorial-use-device-groups/simulated-devices.png)

For four of the simulated sensor devices, use the **Manage device** view to set the customer name to *Contoso*:

## Create a device group

To create a device group:

1. Choose **Device groups** on the left pane.

1. Select **+**:

1. Give your device group the name *Contoso devices*. You can also add a description. A device group can only contain devices from a single device template. Choose the **MXChip IoT DevKit** device template to use for this group.

1. To customize the device group to include only the devices belonging to **Contoso**, select **+ Filter**. Select the **Customer Name** property, the **Equals** comparison operator, and **Contoso** as the value. You can add multiple filters and devices that meet **all** the filter criteria are placed in the device group. The device group you create is accessible to anyone who has access to the application, so anyone can view, modify, or delete the device group:

    > [!TIP]
    > The device group is a dynamic query. Every time you view the list of devices, there may be different devices in the list. The list depends on which devices currently meet the criteria of the query.

1. Choose **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure IoT Edge devices, select Azure IoT Edge templates to create a device group.

## Analytics

You can use **Analytics** with a device group to analyze the telemetry from the devices in the group. For example, you can plot the average temperature reported by all the Contoso environmental sensors.

To analyze the telemetry for a device group:

1. Choose **Analytics** on the left pane.

1. Select the **Contoso devices** device group you created. Then add both the **Temperature** and **Humidity** telemetry types:

    ![Create analytics](./media/tutorial-use-device-groups/create-analysis.png)

    Use the gear-wheel icons next to the telemetry types to select an aggregation type. The default is **Average**. Use **Split by** to change how the aggregate data is shown. For example, if you split by device ID you see a plot for each device when you select **Analyze**.

1. Select **Analyze** to view the average telemetry values:

    ![View analysis](./media/tutorial-use-device-groups/view-analysis.png)

    You can customize the view, change the time period shown, and export the data.
