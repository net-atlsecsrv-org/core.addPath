# Manage your bill in an IoT Central application

This article describes how, as an administrator, you can manage your Azure IoT Central billing. You can move your application from the free pricing plan to a standard pricing plan, and also upgrade or downgrade your pricing plan.

To access the **Administration** section, you must be in the *Administrator* role or have a *custom user role* that allows you to view billing. If you create an Azure IoT Central application, you're automatically assigned to the **Administrator** role.

## Move from free to standard pricing plan

- Applications that use the free pricing plan are free for seven days before they expire. To avoid losing data, you can move them to a standard pricing plan at any time before they expire.
- Applications that use a standard pricing plan are charged per device, with the first two devices free, per application.

Learn more about pricing on the [Azure IoT Central pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-central/).

In the pricing section, you can move your application from the free to a standard pricing plan.

To complete this self-service process, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Pricing** page in the **Administration** section.

1. Select the appropriate Azure Active Directory, and then the Azure subscription to use for your application that uses a paid plan.

1. After you select **Convert**, your application now uses a paid plan and you start getting billed.

> [!Note]
> By default, you are converted to a *Standard 2* pricing plan.

## How to change your application pricing plan

Applications that use a standard pricing plan are charged per device, with the first two devices free, per application.

In the pricing section, you can upgrade or downgrade your Azure IoT pricing plan at any time.

1. Go to the **Pricing** page in the **Administration** section.
