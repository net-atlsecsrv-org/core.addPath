# Tutorial: Create and connect a client application to your Azure IoT Central application (Python)

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-selector-tutorial-connect](../../../includes/iot-central-selector-tutorial-connect.md)]

*This article applies to solution builders and device developers.*

This tutorial shows you how, as a device developer, to connect a Python client application to your Azure IoT Central application. The Python application simulates the behavior of an environmental sensor device. You use a sample _device capability model_ to create a _device template_ in IoT Central. You add views to the device template to enable an operator to interact with a device.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Import a device capability model to create a device template.
> * Add default and custom views to a device template.
> * Publish a device template and add a real device to your IoT Central application.
> * Create and run the Python device code and see it connect to your IoT Central application.
> * View the simulated telemetry sent from the device.
> * Use a view to manage device properties.
> * Call synchronous and asynchronous commands to control the device.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you need the following:

* An Azure IoT Central application created using the **Custom application** template. For more information, see the [create an application quickstart](quick-deploy-iot-central.md). The application must have been created on or after 07/14/2020.
* A development machine with [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.7 or later installed. You can run `python3 --version` at the command line to check your version. Python is available for a wide variety of operating systems. The instructions in this tutorial assume you're running the **python3** command at the Windows command prompt.

### Create a Python application

The following steps show you how to create a Python client application that connects to the real device you added to the application. This Python application simulates the behavior of a real device.

1. In your command-line environment, navigate to the `environmental-sensor` folder you created previously.

1. To install the required libraries, run the following commands:

    ```cmd
    pip install azure-iot-device
    ```

1. Create a file called **environmental_sensor.py** in the `environmental-sensor` folder.

1. Add the following `import` statements at the start of the **environmental_sensor.py** file:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    import os
    import json
    import datetime
    import random

    from azure.iot.device.aio import ProvisioningDeviceClient
    from azure.iot.device.aio import IoTHubDeviceClient
    from azure.iot.device import MethodResponse
    from azure.iot.device import Message
    ```

1. Add the following asynchronous `main` function and variable declarations to the file:

    ```python
    async def main():
      # In a production environment, don't store
      # connection information in the code.
      provisioning_host = 'global.azure-devices-provisioning.net'
      id_scope = '{your Scope ID}'
      registration_id = '{your Device ID}'
      symmetric_key = '{your Primary Key}'

      delay = 2

      # All the remaining code is nested within this main function

    if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    Update the placeholders `{your Scope ID}`, `{your Device ID}`, and `{your Primary Key}` with the values you made a note of previously. In a real application, don't hard code this information in the application.

    All the following function definitions and code are nested within the `main` function.

1. Add the following two functions inside the `main` function to register the device and connect it to your IoT Central application. Registration uses the Azure Device Provisioning Service:

    ```python
      async def register_device():
        provisioning_device_client = ProvisioningDeviceClient.create_from_symmetric_key(
          provisioning_host=provisioning_host,
          registration_id=registration_id,
          id_scope=id_scope,
          symmetric_key=symmetric_key,
        )

        registration_result = await provisioning_device_client.register()

        print(f'Registration result: {registration_result.status}')

        return registration_result

      async def connect_device():
        device_client = None
        try:
          registration_result = await register_device()
          if registration_result.status == 'assigned':
            device_client = IoTHubDeviceClient.create_from_symmetric_key(
              symmetric_key=symmetric_key,
              hostname=registration_result.registration_state.assigned_hub,
              device_id=registration_result.registration_state.device_id,
            )
            # Connect the client.
            await device_client.connect()
            print('Device connected successfully')
        finally:
          return device_client
    ```

1. Add the following function inside the `main` function to send telemetry to your IoT Central application:

    ```python
      async def send_telemetry():
        print(f'Sending telemetry from the provisioned device every {delay} seconds')
        while True:
          temp = random.randrange(1, 75)
          humid = random.randrange(30, 99)
          payload = json.dumps({'temp': temp, 'humid': humid})
          msg = Message(payload)
          await device_client.send_message(msg, )
          print(f'Sent message: {msg}')
          await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    ```

    The names of the telemetry items (`temp` and `humid`) must match the names used in the device template.

1. Add the following functions inside the `main` function to handle commands called from your IoT Central application:

    ```python
      async def blink_command(request):
        print('Received synchronous call to blink')
        response = MethodResponse.create_from_method_request(
          request, status = 200, payload = {'description': f'Blinking LED every {request.payload} seconds'}
        )
        await device_client.send_method_response(response)  # send response
        print(f'Blinking LED every {request.payload} seconds')

      async def diagnostics_command(request):
        print('Starting asynchronous diagnostics run...')
        response = MethodResponse.create_from_method_request(
          request, status = 202
        )
        await device_client.send_method_response(response)  # send response
        print('Generating diagnostics...')
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        print('Generating diagnostics...')
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        print('Generating diagnostics...')
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        print('Sending property update to confirm command completion')
        await device_client.patch_twin_reported_properties({'rundiagnostics': {'value': f'Diagnostics run complete at {datetime.datetime.today()}.'}})

      async def turnon_command(request):
        print('Turning on the LED')
        response = MethodResponse.create_from_method_request(
          request, status = 200
        )
        await device_client.send_method_response(response)  # send response

      async def turnoff_command(request):
        print('Turning off the LED')
        response = MethodResponse.create_from_method_request(
          request, status = 200
        )
        await device_client.send_method_response(response)  # send response

      commands = {
        'blink': blink_command,
        'rundiagnostics': diagnostics_command,
        'turnon': turnon_command,
        'turnoff': turnoff_command,
      }

      # Define behavior for handling commands
      async def command_listener():
        while True:
          method_request = await device_client.receive_method_request()  # Wait for commands
          await commands[method_request.name](method_request)
    ```

    The names of the commands (`blink`, `turnon`, `turnoff`, and `rundiagnostics`) must match the names used in the device template.

    Currently, IoT Central doesn't use the response schema defined in the device capability model. For a synchronous command, the response payload can be any valid JSON. For an asynchronous command, the device should return a 202 response immediately, followed by reported property update when the work is finished. The format of the reported property update is:

    ```json
    {
      [command name] : {
        value: 'response message'
      }
    }
    ```

    An operator can view the response payload in the command history.

1. Add the following functions inside the `main` function to handle property updates sent from your IoT Central application. The message the device sends in response to the [writeable property update](concepts-telemetry-properties-commands.md#writeable-property-types) must include the `av` and `ac` fields. The `ad` field is optional:

    ```python
      async def name_setting(value, version):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(f'Setting name value {value} - {version}')
        await device_client.patch_twin_reported_properties({'name' : {'value': value, 'ad': 'completed', 'ac': 200, 'av': version}})

      async def brightness_setting(value, version):
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        print(f'Setting brightness value {value} - {version}')
        await device_client.patch_twin_reported_properties({'brightness' : {'value': value, 'ad': 'completed', 'ac': 200, 'av': version}})

      settings = {
        'name': name_setting,
        'brightness': brightness_setting
      }

      # define behavior for receiving a twin patch
      async def twin_patch_listener():
        while True:
          patch = await device_client.receive_twin_desired_properties_patch() # blocking
          to_update = patch.keys() & settings.keys()
          await asyncio.gather(
            *[settings[setting](patch[setting], patch['$version']) for setting in to_update]
          )
    ```

    When the operator sets a writeable property in the IoT Central application, the application uses a device twin desired property to send the value to the device. The device then responds using a device twin reported property. When IoT Central receives the reported property value, it updates the property view with a status of **synced**.

    The names of the properties (`name` and `brightness`) must match the names used in the device template.

1. Add the following functions inside the `main` function to control the application:

    ```python
      # Define behavior for halting the application
      def stdin_listener():
        while True:
          selection = input('Press Q to quit\n')
          if selection == 'Q' or selection == 'q':
            print('Quitting...')
            break

      device_client = await connect_device()

      if device_client is not None and device_client.connected:
        print('Send reported properties on startup')
        await device_client.patch_twin_reported_properties({'state': 'true', 'processorArchitecture': 'ARM', 'swVersion': '1.0.0'})
        tasks = asyncio.gather(
          send_telemetry(),
          command_listener(),
          twin_patch_listener(),
        )

        # Run the stdin listener in the event loop
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        user_finished = loop.run_in_executor(None, stdin_listener)

        # Wait for user to indicate they are done listening for method calls
        await user_finished

        # Cancel tasks
        tasks.add_done_callback(lambda r: r.exception())
        tasks.cancel()
        await device_client.disconnect()

      else:
        print('Device could not connect')
    ```

1. Save the the **environmental_sensor.py** file.

## Run your Python application

To start the device client application, run the following command in your command-line environment:

```cmd
python3 environmental_sensor.py
```

You can see the device connects to your Azure IoT Central application and starts sending telemetry:

![Run the client application](media/tutorial-connect-device-python/run-application.png)

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-monitor-environmental-sensor](../../../includes/iot-central-monitor-environmental-sensor.md)]

You can see how the device responds to commands and property updates:

## Next steps

As a device developer, now that you've learned the basics of how to create a device using Python, some suggested next steps are to:

* Read [What are device templates?](./concepts-device-templates.md) to learn more about the role of device templates when you're implementing your device code.
* Read [Get connected to Azure IoT Central](./concepts-get-connected.md) to learn more about how to register devices with IoT Central and how IoT Central secures device connections.
