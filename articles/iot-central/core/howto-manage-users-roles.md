# Manage users and roles in your IoT Central application



This article describes how, as an administrator, you can add, edit, and delete users in your Azure IoT Central application. The article also describes how to manage roles in your Azure IoT Central application.

To access and use the **Administration** section, you must be in the **Administrator** role for an Azure IoT Central application. If you create an Azure IoT Central application, you're automatically added to the **Administrator** role for that application.

## Add users

Every user must have a user account before they can sign in and access an Azure IoT Central application. Microsoft Accounts (MSAs) and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts are supported in Azure IoT Central. Azure Active Directory groups aren't currently supported in Azure IoT Central.

For more information, see [Microsoft account help](https://support.microsoft.com/products/microsoft-account?category=manage-account) and  [Quickstart: Add new users to Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/add-users-azure-active-directory).

1. To add a user to an IoT Central application, go to the **Users** page in the **Administration** section.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Manage users](media/howto-manage-users-roles/manage-users-pnp.png)

1. To add a user, on the **Users** page, choose **+ Add user**.

1. Choose a role for the user from the **Role** drop-down menu. Learn more about roles in the [Manage roles](#manage-roles) section of this article.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A user who is in a custom role that grants them the permission to add other users, can only add users to a role with same or fewer permissions than their own role.

### Edit the roles that are assigned to users

Roles can't be changed after they're assigned. To change the role that's assigned to a user, delete the user, and then add the user again with a different role.

> [!NOTE]
> The roles assigned are specific to IoT Central application and cannot be managed from the Azure Portal.

## Delete users

To delete users, select one or more check boxes on the **Users** page. Then select **Delete**.

## Manage roles

Roles enable you to control who within your organization is allowed to do various tasks in IoT Central. There are three built-in roles you can assign to users of your application. You can also [create custom roles](#create-a-custom-role) if you require finer-grained control.

### Administrator

Users in the **Administrator** role can manage and control every part of the application, including billing.

The user who creates an application is automatically assigned to the **Administrator** role. There must always be at least one user in the **Administrator** role.

### Builder

Users in the **Builder** role can manage every part of the app, but can't make changes on the Administration or Continuous Data Export tabs.

### Operator

Users in the **Operator** role can monitor device health and status. They aren't allowed to make changes to device templates or to administer the application. Operators can add and delete devices, manage device sets, and run analytics and jobs. 

## Create a custom role

If your solution requires finer-grained access controls, you can create custom roles with custom sets of permissions. To create a custom role, navigate to the **Roles** page in the **Administration** section of your application. Then select **+ New role**, and add a name and description for your role. Select the permissions your role requires and then select **Save**.

You can add users to your custom role in the same way that you add users to a built-in role.

### Custom role options

When you define a custom role, you choose the set of permissions that a user is granted if they're a member of the role. Some permissions are dependent on others. For example, if you add the **Update application dashboards** permission to a role, the **View application dashboards** permission is automatically added. The following tables summarize the available permissions, and their dependencies, you can use when creating custom roles.
