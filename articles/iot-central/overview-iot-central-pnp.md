# What is Azure IoT Central (preview features)?

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

> [!WARNING]
> The [IoT Plug and Play](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) capabilities in Azure IoT Central are currently in public preview. Don't use an IoT Plug and Play enabled IoT Central application for production workloads. For production environments use an IoT central application created from a current, generally available, application template.

Azure IoT Central is a fully managed IoT software-as-a-service solution that makes it easy to create products that connect the physical and digital worlds. You can bring your connected product vision to life by:

- Deriving new insights from connected devices to enable better products and experiences for your customers.
- Creating new business opportunities for your organization.

Azure IoT Central, as compared to a typical IoT project:

- Reduces the management burden.
- Reduces operational costs and overheads.
- Makes it easy to customize your application, while working with:
  - Industry-leading technologies such as [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/) and [Azure Time Series Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/time-series-insights/).
  - Enterprise-grade security features such as end-to-end encryption.

The following video presents an overview of Azure IoT Central:

This article outlines, for Azure IoT Central:

- The typical personas associated with a project.
- How to create your application.
- How to connect your devices to your application
- How to manage your application.

## Known issues

> [!Note]
> These known issues only apply to the IoT Central Preview application.

- Rules don't support all actions (only email).
- For complex types - rules, analytics, and device groups aren't supported.
- Continuous data export doesn't support the Avro format (incompatibility).
- Simulated devices don't support all complex types.
- GeoJSON isn't currently supported.
- Map tile isn't currently supported.
- Jobs don't support complex types.
- Array schema types aren't supported.
- Application template export and application copy aren't supported.
- Only the C device SDK and the Node.js device and service SDKs are supported.
- It's only available the north Europe and central US regions.
- Device capability models must have all the interfaces defined inline in the same file.

## Personas

The Azure IoT Central documentation refers to four personas who interact with an Azure IoT Central application:

- A _builder_ is responsible for defining the types of devices that connect to the application and customizing the application for the operator.
- An _operator_ manages the devices connected to the application.
- An _administrator_ is responsible for administrative tasks such as managing users and roles within the application.
- A _device developer_ creates the code that runs on a device connected to your application.

## Create your Azure IoT Central application

As a builder, you use Azure IoT Central to create a custom, cloud-hosted IoT solution for your organization. A custom IoT solution typically consists of:

- A cloud-based application that receives telemetry from your devices and enables you to manage those devices.
- Multiple devices running custom code connected to your cloud-based application.

You can quickly deploy a new Azure IoT Central application and then customize it to your specific requirements in your browser. As a builder, you use the web-based tools to create a _device template_ for the devices that connect to your application. A device template is the blueprint that defines the characteristics and behavior of a type of device such as the:

- Telemetry it sends.
- Business properties that an operator can modify.
- Device properties that are set by a device and are read-only in the application.
- Properties set by an operator that determine the behavior of the device.

This device template includes:

- A _device capability model_ that describes the capabilities a device should implement such as the telemetry it sends and the properties it reports.
- Cloud properties that are not stored on the device.
- Customizations, dashboards, and forms that are part of your IoT Central application.

### Create device templates

[IoT Plug and Play](../iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play.md) enables IoT Central to integrate devices without you writing any embedded device code. At the core of IoT Plug and Play is a device capability model schema that describes device capabilities. In an IoT Central Preview application, device templates use these IoT Plug and Play device capability models.

As a builder, you have several options for creating device templates:

- Design the device template in IoT Central and then implement its device capability model in your device code.
- Import a device capability model from the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://aka.ms/iotdevcat) and then add any cloud properties, customizations, and dashboards your IoT Central application needs.
- Create a device capability model using Visual Studio code. Implement your device code from the model, and connect your device to your IoT Central application. IoT Central finds the device capability model from a repository and creates a simple device template for you.
- Create a device capability model using Visual Studio code. Implement your device code from the model. Manually import the device capability model into your IoT Central application and then add any cloud properties, customizations, and dashboards your IoT Central application needs.

As a builder, you can use IoT Central to generate code for test devices to validate your device templates.

### Customize the UI

As a builder, you can also customize the Azure IoT Central application UI for the operators who are responsible for the day-to-day use of the application. Customizations that a builder can make include:

- Defining the layout of properties and settings on a device template.
- Configuring custom dashboards to help operators discover insights and resolve issues faster.
- Configuring custom analytics to explore time series data from your connected devices.

## Connect your devices

After the builder defines the types of devices that can connect to the application, a device developer creates the code to run on the devices. As a device developer, you use Microsoft's open-source [Azure IoT SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) to create your device code. These SDKs have broad language, platform, and protocol support to meet your needs to connect your devices to your Azure IoT Central application. The SDKs help you implement the following device capabilities:

- Create a secure connection.
- Send telemetry.
- Report status.
- Receive configuration updates.

For more information, see the blog post [Benefits of using the Azure IoT SDKs, and pitfalls to avoid if you don't](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/benefits-of-using-the-azure-iot-sdks-in-your-azure-iot-solution/).

## Manage your application

Azure IoT Central applications are fully hosted by Microsoft, which reduces the administration overhead of managing your applications.

As an operator, you use the Azure IoT Central application to manage the devices in your Azure IoT Central solution. Operators do tasks such as:

- Monitoring the devices connected to the application.
- Troubleshooting and remediating issues with devices.
- Provisioning new devices.

As a builder, you can define custom rules and actions that operate over data streaming from connected devices. An operator can enable or disable these rules at the device level to control and automate tasks within the application.

Administrators manage access to your application with [user roles and permissions](howto-administer-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).
