# Tutorial: Use Azure IoT Central to monitor your devices

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-original-pnp](../../includes/iot-central-original-pnp-note.md)]

This tutorial shows you, as an operator, how to use your Microsoft Azure IoT Central application to monitor your devices and change settings.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Receive a notification
> * Investigate an issue
> * Remediate an issue

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, the builder should complete the three builder tutorials to create the Azure IoT Central application:

* [Define a new device type](tutorial-define-device-type.md)
* [Configure rules and actions for your device](tutorial-configure-rules.md)
* [Customize the operator's views](tutorial-customize-operator.md)

## Receive a notification

Azure IoT Central sends notifications about devices as email messages. The builder added a rule to send a notification when the temperature in a connected air conditioner device exceeded a threshold. Check the emails sent to the account the builder chose to receive notifications.

Open the email message you received at the end of the [Configure rules and actions for your device](tutorial-configure-rules.md) tutorial. In the email, select the link to the device next to **Device Name** in the **Details** section:

The **Device** page for the **Connected Air Conditioner-1** simulated device you created in the previous tutorials opens in your browser:

## Investigate an issue

As an operator, you can view information about the device on the **Measurements**, **Settings**, **Properties**, **Rules**, and **Dashboard** pages. The builder customized the **Dashboard** to display important information about a connected air conditioner device.

Choose the **Dashboard** view to see information about the device.

The chart on the dashboard shows a plot of the device temperature. You can also see the current target temperature for the device in the **Device properties** tile. You decide that the target temperature is too high.

## Remediate an issue

To change the target temperature of the device, use the **Settings** page:

1. Choose **Settings**. Change **Set Temperature** to 75. Choose **Update** to send the new target temperature to the device. When the device confirms the settings change, the status of the setting changes to **synced**:

2. Choose **Dashboard** and verify the new setting value:

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> * Receive a notification
> * Investigate an issue
> * Remediate an issue

Now that you know now to monitor your device, the suggested next step is to [Add a device](tutorial-add-device.md).
