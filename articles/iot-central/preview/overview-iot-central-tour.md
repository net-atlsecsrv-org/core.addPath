# Take a tour of the Azure IoT Central UI (preview features)

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

This article introduces you to the Microsoft Azure IoT Central UI. You can use the UI to create, manage, and use an Azure IoT Central solution and its connected devices.

As a _solution builder_, you use the Azure IoT Central UI to define your Azure IoT Central solution. You can use the UI to:

* Define the types of device that connect to your solution.
* Configure the rules and actions for your devices. 
* Customize the UI for an _operator_ who uses your solution.

As an _operator_, you use the Azure IoT Central UI to manage your Azure IoT Central solution. You can use the UI to:

* Monitor your devices.
* Configure your devices.
* Troubleshoot and remediate issues with your devices.
* Provision new devices.

## IoT Central homepage

The [IoT Central homepage](https://aka.ms/iotcentral-get-started) page is the place where you can learn more about the latest news and features available on IoT Central, create new applications, and see and launch your existing application.

      > ![left pane](media/overview-iot-central-tour/navigationbar-pnp.png)
  :::column-end:::
  :::column span="2":::
     **Dashboard** displays your application dashboard. As a *solution builder*, you can customize the global dashboard for your operators. Depending on their user role, operators can also create their own personal dashboards.
     
     **Devices** enables you to manage your connected devices - real and simulated.

     **Device groups** lets you view and create logical collections of devices specified by a query. You can save this query and use device groups through the application to perform bulk operations.

     **Rules** enables you to create and edit rules to monitor your devices. Rules are evaluated based on device telemetry and trigger customizable actions.

     **Analytics** lets you create custom views on top of device data to derive insights from your application.

     **Jobs** enables you to manage your devices at scale by running bulk operations.

     **Device templates** is where you create and manage the characteristics of the devices that connect to your application.

     **Data export** enables you to configure a continuous export to external services - such as storage and queues.

     **Administration** is where you can manage your application's settings, customization, billing, users, and roles.

     **IoT Central** lets *administrators* to jump back to IoT Central's app manager.

### Dashboard
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Dashboard](media/overview-iot-central-tour/dashboard-pnp.png)

* The dashboard is the first page you see when you sign in to your Azure IoT Central application. As a *solution builder*, you can create and customize multiple global application dashboards for other users. Learn more about [adding tiles to your dashboard](../core/howto-add-tiles-to-your-dashboard.md?toc=/azure/iot-central/preview/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central/preview/breadcrumb/toc.json)

* As an *operator*, if your user role allows it, you can create personal dashboards to monitor what you care about.
