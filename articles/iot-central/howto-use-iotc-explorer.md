# Monitor device connectivity using the Azure IoT Central Explorer

*This topic applies to builders and administrators.*

Use the IoT Central Explorer CLI to see messages your devices are sending to IoT Central and observe changes in the IoT Hub twin. You can use this open-source tool to gain deeper insight into the state of device connectivity and diagnose issues of device messages not reaching the cloud or devices not responding to twin changes.

[Visit the iotc-explorer repository in GitHub.](https://aka.ms/iotciotcexplorercligithub)

## Prerequisites

+ Node.js version 8.x or higher - https://nodejs.org
+ An administrator of your application must generate an access token for you to use in iotc-explorer

## Install iotc-explorer

Run the following command from your command line to install:

```cmd/sh
npm install -g iotc-explorer
```

> [!NOTE]
> You typically need to run the install command with `sudo` in Unix-like environments.

## Run iotc-explorer

The following sections describe common commands and options that you can use when you run
`iotc-explorer`. To view the full set of commands and options, pass
`--help` to `iotc-explorer` or any of its subcommands.

### Login

Before you get going, you need to have an administrator of your IoT Central application to get an access token for you to use. The administrator takes the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Administration** then **Access Tokens**.
1. Select **Generate Token**.

1. Enter a Token name, select **Next**, and then **Copy**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The token value is only shown once, so it must be copied before closing the dialog. After closing the dialog, it is never shown again.

You can use the token to log in to the CLI as follows:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer login "<Token value>"
```

If you prefer to not have the token persisted in your shell history, you can
leave the token out and instead provide it when prompted:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer login
```

### Monitor device messages

You can watch the messages coming from either a specific device or all devices
in your application using the `monitor-messages` command. This command starts a
watcher that continuously outputs new messages as they arrive:

To watch all devices in your application, run the following command:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer monitor-messages
```

Output:

![monitor-messages command output](media/howto-use-iotc-explorer/monitormessages.png)

To watch a specific device, just add the device id to the end of the command:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer monitor-messages <your-device-id>
```

You can also output a more machine-friendly format by adding
the `--raw` option to the command:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer monitor-messages --raw
```

### Get device twin

You can use the `get-twin` command to get the contents of the twin for an IoT
Central device. To do so, run the following command:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer get-twin <your-device-id>
```

Output:

![get-twin command output](media/howto-use-iotc-explorer/getdevicetwin.png)

As with `monitor-messages`, you can get a more machine-friendly output by
passing the `--raw` option:

```cmd/sh
iotc-explorer get-twin <your-device-id> --raw
```
