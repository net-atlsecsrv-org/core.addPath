    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Central Billing info dialog box.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/new-application-connectedwastemanagement-billinginfo.png)

 
Your newly created application comes with preconfigured:
* Sample operator dashboards.
* Sample predefined connected waste bin device templates.
* Simulated connected waste bin devices.
* Rules and jobs.
* Sample branding. 

It's your application, and you can modify it anytime. Let's now explore the application and make some customizations.  

## Explore and customize the operator dashboard 

Take a look at the **Wide World waste management dashboard**, which you see after creating your app.

   ![Screenshot of Wide World waste management dashboard.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-dashboard1.png)

As a builder, you can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators. First, let's explore the dashboard. 

>[!NOTE]
>All data shown in the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which you'll see  more of in the next section. 

The dashboard consists of different tiles:

* **Wide World Waste utility image tile**: The first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of a fictitious waste utility, "Wide World Waste." You can customize the tile and put in your own image, or you can remove it. 

* **Waste bin image tile**: You can use image and content tiles to create a visual representation of the device that's being monitored, along with a description. 

* **Fill level KPI tile**: This tile displays a value reported by a *fill level* sensor in a waste bin. Fill level and other sensors, like *odor meter* or *weight* in a waste bin, can be remotely monitored. An operator can take action, like dispatching a trash collection truck. 

* **Waste monitoring area map**: This tile uses Azure Maps, which you can configure directly in Azure IoT Central. The map tile displays device location. Try to hover over the map and try the controls over the map, like zoom-in, zoom-out, or expand.

     ![Screenshot of Connected Waste Management Template Dashboard map.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-dashboard-map.png)


* **Fill, odor, weight level bar chart**: You can visualize one or multiple kinds of device telemetry data in a bar chart. You can also expand the bar chart.  

  ![Screenshot of Connected Waste Management Template Dashboard bar chart.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-dashboard-barchart.png)


* **Field Services**: The dashboard includes a link to how to integrate with Dynamics 365 Field Services from your Azure IoT Central application. For example, you can use Field Services to create tickets for dispatching trash collection services. 


### Customize the dashboard 

You can customize the dashboard by selecting the **Edit** menu. Then you can add new tiles or configure existing ones. Here's what the dashboard looks like in editing mode: 

![Screenshot of Connected Waste Management Template Dashboard in editing mode.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/edit-dashboard.png)

You can also select **+ New** to create a new dashboard and configure from scratch. You can have multiple dashboards, and you can switch between your dashboards from the dashboard menu. 

## Explore the device template

A device template in Azure IoT Central defines the capabilities of a device, which can include telemetry, properties, or commands. As a builder, you can define device templates that represent the capabilities of the devices you will connect. 

The Connected waste management application comes with a sample template for a connected waste bin device.

To view the device template:

1. In Azure IoT Central, from the left pane of your app, select **Device templates**. 

    ![Screenshot showing the list of device templates in the application.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-devicetemplate.png)

1. In the **Device templates** list, select **Connected Waste Bin**.

1. Examine the device template capabilities. You can see that it defines sensors like **Fill level**, **Odor meter**, **Weight**, and **Location**.

   ![Screenshot showing the details of the Connected Waste Bin device template.](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-devicetemplate-connectedbin.png)


### Customize the device template

Try to customize the following:
1. From the device template menu, select **Customize**.
1. Find the **Odor meter** telemetry type.
1. Update the **Display name** of **Odor meter** to **Odor level**.
1. Try to update the unit of measurement, or set **Min value** and **Max value**.
1. Select **Save**. 

### Add a cloud property 

Here's how:
1. From the device template menu, select **Cloud property**.
1. Select **+ Add Cloud Property**. In Azure IoT Central, you can add a property that is relevant to the device but isn't expected to be sent by a device. For example, a cloud property might be an alerting threshold specific to installation area, asset information, or maintenance information. 
1. Select **Save**. 
 
### Views 
The connected waste bin device template comes with predefined views. Explore the views, and update them if you want to. The views define how operators see the device data and input cloud properties.
