6. You now have created a connected waste management app using the Azure IoT Central **Connected waste management template**. 

Congratulations! Your newly created application comes with pre-configured:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample pre-defined connected waste bin device templates
* Simulated connected waste bin devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Sample Branding using white labeling 

It is your application and you can modify it anytime. Let’s now explore the application and make some customizations.  

## Explore and customize operator dashboard 
After creating the application you land in the **Wide Waste connected waste management dashboard**.

   ![Connected Waste Management dashboard](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-dashboard1.png)

As a builder, you can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators. Before you try to customize, let's explore the dashboard. 

> [!NOTE]
> All data displayed in the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which will be explored in the next section. 

The dashboard consists of different kinds of tiles:

* ***Wide World Waste utility image tile***: the first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of a fictitious Waste utility "Wide World Waste". You can customize the tile and put your own image or remove it. 

* ***Waste bin image tile***: you can use image and content tiles to create a visual representation of the device that is being monitored along with a descriptive text. 

* ***Fill level KPI tile***: the tile displays a value reported by a *fill level* sensor in a waste bin. *Fill level* and other sensors like *odor meter* or *weight* in a waste bin can be remotely monitored. An operator can take action, like dispatching trash collection truck. 

*  ***Waste monitoring area map***: the map is using Azure Maps, which you can configure directly in Azure IoT Central. The map tile is displaying device location. Try to hover over the map and try the controls over the map, like zoom-in, zoom-out or expand.

     ![Connected Waste Management dashboard map](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-dashboard-map.png)


* ***Fill, odor, weight level bar chart**: you can visualize one or multiple device telemetry data in a bar chart. You can also expand the bar chart.  

  ![Connected Waste Management dashboard bar chart](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-dashboard-barchart.png)


* **Field Services content tile**: the dashboard includes link to how to integrate with Dynamics 365 Field Services from your Azure IoT Central application. As an example, you can use Field Services to create tickets for dispatching trash collection services. 


### Customize dashboard 

As a builder, you can customize views in dashboard for operators. You can try:
1. Click on **Edit** to customize the **Wide World connected waste management dashboard**. You can customize the dashboard by clicking on the **Edit** menu. Once the dashboard is in **edit** mode, you can add new tiles, or you can configure

2. You can also click on **+ New** to create new dashboard and configure from scratch. You can have multiple dashboards and you can navigate between your dashboards from the dashboard menu. 

## Explore connected waste bin device template

A device template in Azure IoT Central defines the capability of a device, which can be telemetry, properties, or command. As a builder, you can define device templates that represent the capability of the devices you will connect. 
 

The **Connected waste management** application comes with a sample connected waste bin device template.

To view the device template:

1. Click on **Device templates** from the left navigation pane of your application in IoT Central. 

    ![Device Template](./media/tutorial-connectedwastemanagement/connectedwastemanagement-devicetemplate.png)

2. In the Device templates list you will see **Connected Waste Bin**. Open by clicking on the name.

3. Familirize with the device template capabilites. You can see it defines sensors like *Fill level*, *Odor meter*, *weight*, *location* etc.
