6. You now have created a water quality monitoring app using the Azure IoT Central **Water quality monitoring template**. 

Your newly created application comes with pre-configured:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample pre-defined water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Sample Branding using white labeling 

It is your application and you can modify it anytime. Let’s now explore the application and make some customizations.  


## Explore and customize operator dashboard 
After creating the application you land in the **Wide Water water quality monitoring dashboard**.


   ![Water Quality Monitoring dashboard](./media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/waterqualitymonitoring-dashboard1.png)

As a builder, you can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators. Before you try to customize, let's explore the dashboard. 

All the data displayed in the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which will be explored in the next section. 

The dashboard consists of different kinds of tiles:

* **Wide World Water utility image tile**: the first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of a fictitious Water utility "Wide World Water". You can customize the tile and put your own image or remove it. 

* **Average pH KPI tile**: you can see that there are KPI tiles at the top like **Average pH in the last 30 minutes**. You can customize KPI tiles and set to a different type and time range.

*  **Water monitoring area map**: IoT Central uses Azure Maps, which you can directly set in your application and display device location. You can also map location information to your device from the application and can use Azure Maps to display it on a map. Try to hover over the map and try the controls over the map. 

* **Average pH distribution Heatmap chart**: you can choose different visualization charts to display device telemetry data in the way that is most appropriate to your application. Heatmap 

* **Critical quality indicators line chart**: you can visualize one or multiple device telemetries plotted as a line chart over a desired time range.  

* **Concentration of chemical agents bar chart**: you can visualize one or multiple device telemetry data in a bar chart as in the sample. 

* **Action button**: the dashboard includes an example of an action tile that an operator can initiate directly from the monitoring dashboard, like initiating an action to reset device properties. 

* **Properties list tiles**: the dashboard has multiple properties tiles representing threshold information, device health information, and maintenance information. 


### Customize dashboard 

As a builder, you can customize views in dashboard for operators. 
1. Click on **Edit** to customize the **Wide World water quality monitoring dashboard**. You can customize the dashboard by clicking on the **Edit** menu. Once the dashboard is in **edit** mode, you can add new tiles, or you can configure

2. Click on **+ New** to create new dashboard and configure from scratch. You can have multiple dashboards and you can navigate between your dashboards from the dashboard menu.

## Explore water quality monitor device template
A device template in Azure IoT Central defines the capability of a device, which can be telemetry, properties, and commands. As a builder, you can define device templates in IoT Central that represent the capability of the devices that will be connected. In IoT Central, you can also create simulated devices to test your device template and application. 
 

The **Water quality monitoring** application you have created from the application template comes with a reference water quality monitor device template.

To view the device template:

1.  Click on **Device templates** from the left navigation pane of your application in IoT Central. 
2. In the Device templates list you will see **Water Quality Monitor**. Open by clicking on the name.
