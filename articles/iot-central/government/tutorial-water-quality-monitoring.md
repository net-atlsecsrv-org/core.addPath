1. Select the **Water quality monitoring** application template. This application template includes a water quality device template, simulated devices, an operator dashboard, and preconfigured monitoring rules.

1. Select **Create app**. The **New application** pane opens and shows the following elements:

    * **Application name**: By default, the application name is **Water quality monitoring** followed by a unique ID string that Azure IoT Central generates. If you want, you can enter a display name or change the application name later.
    * **URL**: You can enter any URL you want or change the URL value later.
    * If you have an Azure subscription, enter values for **Directory**, **Azure subscription**, and **Region**. If you don't have a subscription, you can turn on **7-day free trial** and complete the required contact information.

    For more information about directories and subscriptions, see the [Create an application](../core/quick-deploy-iot-central-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json) quickstart.

1. Select the **Create** button on the lower-left part of the page.

    ![The Azure IoT Central new-application page](./media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/new-application-waterqualitymonitoring1.png)

You've now created a water quality monitoring application by using the Azure IoT Central **Water quality monitoring** template.

Your new application comes with these preconfigured components:

* Operator dashboards
* Water quality monitoring device templates
* Simulated water quality monitoring devices
* Rules and jobs
* Branding that uses white labeling

You can modify your application at any time.

Next, explore the application and make some customizations.

## Explore and customize the operator dashboard

After you create the application, the **Wide World water quality dashboard** pane opens.

   ![The water quality monitoring dashboard](./media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/waterqualitymonitoring-dashboard1.png)

As a builder, you can create and customize views on the dashboard for use by operators. But before you try to customize, first explore the dashboard.

All data shown in the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which is discussed in the next section.

The dashboard includes the following kinds of tiles:

* **Wide World water utility image tile**: The first tile in the upper-left corner of the dashboard is an image that shows the fictitious utility named Wide World. You can customize the tile to use your own image, or you can remove the tile.

* **Average pH KPI tiles**: KPI tiles like **Average pH in the last 30 minutes** are at the top of the dashboard pane. You can customize KPI tiles and set each to a different type and time range.

* **Water monitoring area map**: Azure IoT Central uses Azure Maps, which you can directly set in your application to show device location. You can also map location information from your application to your device and then use Azure Maps to show the information on a map. Hover over the map and try the controls.

* **Average pH distribution heat-map chart**: You can select different visualization charts to show device telemetry in the way that is most appropriate for your application.

* **Critical quality indicators line chart**: You can visualize device telemetry plotted as a line chart over a time range.  

* **Concentration of chemical agents bar chart**: You can visualize device telemetry in a bar chart.

* **Action button**: The dashboard includes a tile for actions that an operator can initiate directly from the monitoring dashboard. Resetting a device's properties is an example of such actions.

* **Property list tiles**: The dashboard has multiple property tiles that represent threshold information, device health information, and maintenance information.

### Customize the dashboard

As a builder, you can customize views on the dashboard for use by operators.

1. Select **Edit** to customize the **Wide World water quality dashboard** pane. You can customize the dashboard by selecting commands on the **Edit** menu. After the dashboard is in edit mode, you can add new tiles, or you can configure the existing files.

    ![Edit your dashboard](./media/tutorial-waterqualitymonitoring/edit-dashboard.png)

1. Select **+ New** to create a new dashboard that you can configure. You can have multiple dashboards and can navigate among them from the dashboard menu.

## Explore a water quality monitoring device template

A device template in Azure IoT Central defines the capabilities of a device. Available capabilities are telemetry, properties, and commands. As a builder, you can define device templates in Azure IoT Central that represent the capabilities of the connected devices. You can also create simulated devices to test your device template and application.

The water quality monitoring application you created comes with a water quality monitoring device template.

To view the device template:

1. Select **Device templates** on the leftmost pane of your application in Azure IoT Central.
1. From the list of device templates, select **Water Quality Monitor**. That device template opens.
