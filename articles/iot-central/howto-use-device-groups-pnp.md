# Use device groups in your Azure IoT Central application (preview features)

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

This article describes how, as an operator, to use device groups in your Azure IoT Central application.

A device group is a list of devices that are grouped together because they match some specified criteria. Device groups help you manage, visualize, and analyze devices at scale by grouping devices into smaller, logical groups. For example, you can create a device group to list all the air conditioner devices in Seattle to enable a technician to find the devices for which they're responsible. This article shows you how to create and configure device groups.

## Create a device group

To create a device group:

1. Choose **Device Groups** on the left navigation menu.

1. Select **+ New**.

1. Give your device group a name that is unique across the entire application. You can also add a description. A device group can only contain devices from a single device template. Choose the device template to use for this group.

1. Create the query to identify the devices for the device group by selecting a property, a comparison operator, and a value. You can add multiple queries and devices that meet **all** the criteria are placed in the device group. The device group you create is accessible to anyone who has access to the application, so anyone can view, modify, or delete the device group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The device group is a dynamic query. Every time you view the list of devices, there may be different devices in the list. The list depends on which devices currently meet the criteria of the query.

1. Choose **Save**.

## Analytics

The analytics in device groups is the same as the main analytics tab in the left navigation menu. You can learn more about analytics in the article on [how to create analytics](howto-use-device-groups-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).
