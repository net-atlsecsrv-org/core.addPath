# Manage devices in your Azure IoT Central application

This article describes how, as an operator, to manage devices in your Azure IoT Central application. As an operator, you can:

- Use the **Device Explorer** page to view, add, and delete devices connected to your Azure IoT Central application.
- Maintain an up-to-date inventory of your devices.
- Keep your device metadata up-to-date by changing the values stored in the device properties.
- Control the behavior of your devices by updating a setting on a specific device from the **Settings** page.

## View your devices

To view an individual device:

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the left navigation menu. Here you see a list of your [device templates](howto-set-up-template.md).

1. Choose a device template in the **Templates** list.

1. In the right-hand pane of the **Device Explorer** page, you see a list of devices created from that device template. Choose an individual device to see the device details page for that device:

    ![Device Details Page](./media/howto-manage-devices/devicelist.png)

## Add a device

To add a device to your Azure IoT Central application:

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the left navigation menu.

1. Choose the device template from which you want to create a device.

1. Choose + **New**.

1. Choose **Real** or **Simulated**. A real device is for a physical device that you connect to your Azure IoT Central application. A simulated device has sample data generated for you by Azure IoT Central.

## Import devices

To connect large number of devices to your application, you can bulk import devices from a CSV file. The CSV file should have the following columns and headers:

* **IOTC_DeviceID** - the device ID should be all lowercase.
* **IOTC_DeviceName** - this column is optional.

To bulk-register devices in your application:

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the left navigation menu.

1. On the left panel, choose the device template for which you want to bulk create the devices.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you donâ€™t have a device template yet then you can import devices under **Unassociated devices** and register them without a template. After devices have been imported, you can then associate them with a template.

1. Select **Import**.

    ![Import Action](./media/howto-manage-devices/bulkimport1a.png)

1. Select the CSV file that has the list of Device IDs to be imported.

1. Device import starts once the file has been uploaded. You can track the import status at the top of the device grid.

1. Once the import completes, a success message is shown on the device grid.

    ![Import Success](./media/howto-manage-devices/bulkimport3a.png)

If the device import operation fails, you see an error message on the device grid. A log file capturing all the errors is generated that you can download.

**Associating devices with a template**

If you register devices by starting the import under **Unassociated devices**, then the devices are created without any device template association. Devices must be associated with a template to explore the data and other details about the device. Follow these steps to associate devices with a template:

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the left navigation menu.

1. On the left panel, choose **Unassociated devices**:

    ![Unassociated Devices](./media/howto-manage-devices/unassociateddevices1a.png)

1. Select the devices you want to associate with a template:

1. Select **Associate**:

    ![Associate Devices](./media/howto-manage-devices/unassociateddevices2a.png)

1. Choose the template from the list of available templates and select **Associate**.

1. The selected devices are associated with the device template you chose.

> [!NOTE]
> After a device has been associated with a template it cannot be unassociated or associated with a different template.

## Export devices

To connect a real device to IoT Central, you need its connection string. You can export device details in bulk to get the information you need to create device connection strings. The export process creates a CSV file with the device identity, device name, and keys for all the selected devices.

To bulk export devices from your application:

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the left navigation menu.

1. On the left panel, choose the device template from which you want to export the devices.

1. Select the devices that you want to export and then select the **Export** action.

    ![Export](./media/howto-manage-devices/export1a.png)

1. The export process starts. You can track the status at the top of the grid.

1. When the export completes, a success message is shown along with a link to download the generated file.

1. Select the **success message** to download the file to a local folder on the disk.

    ![Export Success](./media/howto-manage-devices/export2a.png)

1. The exported CSV file contains the following columns: device ID, device name, device keys, and X509 certificate thumbprints:

    * IOTC_DEVICEID
    * IOTC_DEVICENAME
    * IOTC_SASKEY_PRIMARY
    * IOTC_SASKEY_SECONDARY
    * IOTC_X509THUMBPRINT_PRIMARY
    * IOTC_X509THUMBPRINT_SECONDARY

See [Device connectivity in Azure IoT Central](concepts-connectivity.md), for more information about connection strings and connecting real devices to your IoT Central application.

## Delete a device

To delete either a real or simulated device from your Azure IoT Central application:

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the navigation menu.

1. Choose the device template of the device you want to delete.

1. Check the box next to the device to delete.

1. Choose **Delete**.

## Change a device setting

Settings control the behavior of a device. In other words, they enable you to provide inputs to your device. You can view and update device settings on the **Device Details** page.

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on the navigation menu.

1. Choose the device template of the device whose settings you want to change.

1. Choose the **Settings** tab. Here you see all the settings your device has and their current values. For each setting, you can see if the device is still syncing.

1. Modify the settings to the values you need. You can modify multiple settings at a time and update them all at the same time.

1. Choose **Update**. The values are sent to your device. When the device confirms the setting change, the status of the setting goes back to **synced**.

## Change a property

Properties are the device metadata associated with the device, such as city and serial number. You can view and update properties on the **Device Details** page.

1. Choose **Device Explorer** on navigation menu.

1. Choose the device template of the device whose properties you want to change.

1. Choose the **Properties** tab, where you see all the properties.

1. Modify the application properties to the values you need. You can modify multiple properties at once and update them all at the same time. Choose **Update**.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change the value of _device properties_. Device properties are set by the device and are read-only within the Azure IoT Central application.
