# Display and configure Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) metrics 

In this article, you'll learn how to display and configure Azure IoT Connector for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)* metrics.

> [!TIP]
> To learn how to set up the export of metrics data, follow the guidance in [Export Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) metrics through diagnostics settings](./iot-metrics-diagnostics-export.md).

## Display metrics for Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview)

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, and then select your Azure API for FHIR service. 

2. On the left pane, select **Metrics**. 

3. Select the **IoT Connector** tab.

## Metric types for Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) 

The IoT Connector metrics you can display are listed in the following table:

|Metric type|Metric purpose| 
|-----------|--------------|
|Number of Incoming Messages|Displays the number of received raw incoming messages (for example, the device events).|
|Number of Normalized Messages|Displays the number of normalized messages.|
|Number of Message Groups|Displays the number of groups that have messages aggregated in the designated time window.|
|Average Normalized Stage Latency|Displays the average latency of the normalized stage. The normalized stage performs normalization on raw incoming messages.|
|Average Group Stage Latency|Displays the average latency of the group stage. The group stage performs buffering, aggregating, and grouping on normalized messages.| 
|Total Error Count|Displays the total number of errors.| 

## Focus on and configure Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) metrics

In this example, let's focus on the **Number of Incoming Messages** metric.

1. Select a point-in-time that you want to focus on.
