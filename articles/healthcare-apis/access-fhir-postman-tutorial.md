# Access Azure API for FHIR with Postman

A client application would access an FHIR API through a [REST API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html). You may also want to interact directly with the FHIR server as you build applications, for example, for debugging purposes. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps needed to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to access a FHIR server. Postman is a tool often used for debugging when building applications that access APIs.

## Prerequisites

- A FHIR endpoint in Azure. You can set that up using the managed Azure API for FHIR or the Open Source FHIR server for Azure. Set up the managed Azure API for FHIR using [Azure portal](fhir-paas-portal-quickstart.md), [PowerShell](fhir-paas-powershell-quickstart.md), or [Azure CLI](fhir-paas-cli-quickstart.md).
- A  [client application](register-confidential-azure-ad-client-app.md) you will be using to access the FHIR service
- Postman installed. You can get it from [https://www.getpostman.com](https://www.getpostman.com)

## FHIR server and authentication details

In order to use Postman, the following details are needed:

- Your FHIR server URL, for example `https://MYACCOUNT.azurehealthcareapis.com`
- The identity provider `Authority` for your FHIR server, for example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT-ID}`
- The configured `audience`. This is is usually the URL of the FHIR server, e.g. `https://MYACCOUNT.azurehealthcareapis.com` or just `https://azurehealthcareapis.com`.
- The `client_id` (or application ID) of the [client application](register-confidential-azure-ad-client-app.md) you will be using to access the FHIR service.
- The `client_secret` (or application secret) of the client application.

Finally, you should check that `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback` is a registered reply URL for your client application.

## Connect to FHIR server

Using Postman, do a `GET` request to `https://fhir-server-url/metadata`:

![Postman Metadata Capability Statement](media/tutorial-postman/postman-metadata.png)

The metadata URL for Azure API for FHIR is `https://MYACCOUNT.azurehealthcareapis.com/metadata`. In this example, the FHIR server URL is `https://fhirdocsmsft.azurewebsites.net` and the capability statement of the server is available at `https://fhirdocsmsft.azurewebsites.net/metadata`. That endpoint should be accessible without authentication.

If you attempt to access restricted resources, you should get an "Authentication failed" response:

![Authentication Failed](media/tutorial-postman/postman-authentication-failed.png)

## Obtaining an access token

To obtain a valid access token, select "Authorization" and pick TYPE "OAuth 2.0":

![Set OAuth 2.0](media/tutorial-postman/postman-select-oauth2.png)

Hit "Get New Access Token" and a dialog appears:

![Request New Access Token](media/tutorial-postman/postman-request-token.png)

You will need to some details:

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Token Name            | MYTOKEN                                                                                                         | A name you choose          |
| Grant Type            | Authorization Code                                                                                              |                            |
| Callback URL          | `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback`                                                                      |                            |
| Auth URL              | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT-ID}/oauth2/authorize?resource=<audience>` | `audience` is `https://MYACCOUNT.azurehealthcareapis.com` for Azure API for FHIR |
| Access Token URL      | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT ID}/oauth2/token`                                                      |                            |
| Client ID             | `XXXXXXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`                                                                            | Application ID             |
| Client Secret         | `XXXXXXXX`                                                                                                        | Secret client key          |
| Scope | `<Leave Blank>` |
| State                 | `1234`                                                                                                            |                            |
| Client Authentication | Send client credentials in body                                                                                 |                 

Hit "Request Token" and you will be guided through the Azure Active Directory Authentication flow and a token will be returned to Postman. If you run into problems open the Postman Console (from the "View->Show Postman Console" menu item).

Scroll down on the returned token screen and hit "Use Token":

![Use Token](media/tutorial-postman/postman-use-token.png)

The token should now be populated in the "Access Token" field and you can select tokens from "Available Tokens". If you "Send" again to repeat the `Patient` resource search, you should get a Status `200 OK`:

![200 OK](media/tutorial-postman/postman-200-OK.png)

In this case, there are no patients in the database and the search is empty.

If you inspect the access token with a tool like [https://jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms), you should see content like:

```jsonc
{
  "aud": "https://MYACCOUNT.azurehealthcareapis.com",
  "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/{TENANT-ID}/",
  "iat": 1545343803,
  "nbf": 1545343803,
  "exp": 1545347703,
  "acr": "1",
  "aio": "AUQAu/8JXXXXXXXXXdQxcxn1eis459j70Kf9DwcUjlKY3I2G/9aOnSbw==",
  "amr": [
    "pwd"
  ],
  "appid": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "oid": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "appidacr": "1",

  ...// Truncated
}
```

In troubleshooting situations, validating that you have the correct audience (`aud` claim) is a good place to start. If your token is from the correct issuer (`iss` claim) and has the correct audience (`aud` claim), but you are still unable to access the FHIR API, it is likely that the user or service principal (`oid` claim) does not have access to the FHIR data plane. We recommend you [use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](configure-azure-rbac.md) to assign data plane roles to users. If you are using an external, secondary Azure Active directory tenant for your data plane, you will need to [configure local RBAC assignments](configure-local-rbac.md).

It is also possible to [get a token for the Azure API for FHIR using the Azure CLI](get-healthcare-apis-access-token-cli.md). If you are using a token obtained with the Azure CLI, you should use Authorization type "Bearer Token" and paste the token in directly.

## Inserting a patient

Now that you have a valid access token. You can insert a new patient. Switch to method "POST" and add the following JSON document in the body of the request:

[!code-json[](samples/sample-patient.json)]

Hit "Send" and you should see that the patient is successfully created:

![Patient Created](media/tutorial-postman/postman-patient-created.png)

If you repeat the patient search, you should now see the patient record:

![Patient Created](media/tutorial-postman/postman-patient-found.png)
