# Register a resource application in Azure Active Directory

In this article, you'll learn how to register a resource (or API) application in Azure Active Directory. A resource application is an Azure Active Directory representation of the FHIR server API itself and client applications can request access to the resource when authenticating. The resource application is also known as the *audience* in OAuth parlance.

## Azure API for FHIR

If you are using the Azure API for FHIR, a resource application is automatically created when you deploy the service. As long as you are using the Azure API for FHIR in the same Azure Active Directory tenant as you are deploying your application, you can skip this how-to-guide and instead deploy your Azure API for FHIR to get started.

If you are using a different Azure Active Directory tenant (not associated with your subscription), you can import the Azure API for FHIR resource application into your tenant with 
PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId 4f6778d8-5aef-43dc-a1ff-b073724b9495
```

or you can use Azure CLI:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create --id 4f6778d8-5aef-43dc-a1ff-b073724b9495
```

## FHIR Server for Azure

If you are using the open source FHIR Server for Azure, follow the steps on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/docs/Register-Resource-Application.md) to register a resource application.
