# Register a confidential client application in Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to register a confidential client application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).  

A client application registration is an Azure AD representation of an application that can be used to authenticate on behalf of a user and request access to [resource applications](register-resource-azure-ad-client-app.md). A confidential client application is an application that can be trusted to hold a secret and present that secret when requesting access tokens. Examples of confidential applications are server-side applications. 

To register a new confidential client application, refer to the steps below. 

## Register a new application

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Select **App registrations**.

1. Select **New registration**.

1. Give the application a user-facing display name.

1. For **Supported account types**, select who can use the application or access the API.

1. (Optional) Provide a **Redirect URI**. These details can be changed later, but if you know the reply URL of your application, enter it now.

1. Select **Register**.

## API permissions

Now that you've registered your application, you must select which API permissions this application should request on behalf of users.

1. Select **API permissions**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-aad/portal-aad-register-new-app-registration-CONF-CLIENT-API-Permissions.png" alt-text="Confidential client. API Permissions.":::

1. Select **Add a permission**.

    If you're using the Azure API for FHIR, you'll add a permission to the Azure Healthcare APIs by searching for **Azure Healthcare API** under **APIs my organization uses**. The search result for Azure Healthcare API will only return if you've already [deployed the Azure API for FHIR](fhir-paas-powershell-quickstart.md).

    If you're referencing a different resource application, select your [FHIR API Resource Application Registration](register-resource-azure-ad-client-app.md) that you created previously under **My APIs**.

1. Select scopes (permissions) that the confidential client application will ask for on behalf of a user. Select **user_impersonation**, and then select **Add permissions**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/conf-client-app/confidential-client-add-permission.png" alt-text="Confidential client. Delegated Permissions":::


## Application secret

1. Select **Certificates & secrets**, and then select **New client secret**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-aad/portal-aad-register-new-app-registration-CONF-CLIENT-SECRET.png" alt-text="Confidential client. Application Secret.":::

1. Enter a **Description** for the client secret. Select the **Expires** drop-down menu to choose an expiration time frame, and then click **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-aad/add-a-client-secret.png" alt-text="Add a client secret.":::

1. After the client secret string is created, copy its **Value** and **ID**, and store them in a secure location of your choice.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-aad/client-secret-string-password.png" alt-text="Client secret string."::: 

> [!NOTE]
>The client secret string is visible only once in the Azure portal. When you navigate away from the Certificates & secrets web page and then return back to it, the Value string becomes masked. It's important to make a copy your client secret string immediately after it is generated. If you don't have a backup copy of your client secret, you must repeat the above steps to regenerate it.
 
## Next steps

In this article, you were guided through the steps of how to register a confidential client application in the Azure AD. You were also guided through the steps of how to add API permissions to the Azure Healthcare API. Lastly, you were shown how to create an application secret. Furthermore, you can learn how to access your FHIR server using Postman.
