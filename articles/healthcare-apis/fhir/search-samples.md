# FHIR search examples

Below are some examples of using FHIR search operations, including search parameters and modifiers, chain and reverse chain search, composite search, viewing the next entry set for search results, and searching with a `POST` request. For more information about search, see [Overview of FHIR Search](overview-of-search.md).
   
## Search result parameters

### _include

`_include` searches across resources for the ones that include the specified parameter of the resource. For example, you can search across `MedicationRequest` resources to find only the ones that include information about the prescriptions for a specific patient, which is the `reference` parameter `patient`:

```rest
 GET [your-fhir-server]/MedicationRequest?_include=MedicationRequest:patient

```

> [!NOTE]
> **_include** and **_revinclude** is limited to 100 items.

### _revinclude

`_revinclude` is an additional search on top of `_include`, searching across the resources that reference the search results from `_include`. For example, you can search `MedicationRequest` resources. For each resource returned, search for `DetectedIssue` resources that show the clinical issues with the `patient`:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/MedicationRequest?_revinclude=DetectedIssue:patient

```
### _elements

`_elements` narrows down the search result to a subset of fields to reduce the response size by omitting unnecessary data. The parameter accepts a comma-separated list of base elements:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?_elements=identifier,active

```

In this request, you'll get back a bundle of patients, but each resource will only include the identifier(s) and the patient's active status. Resources in this returned response will contain a `meta.tag` value of `SUBSETTED` to indicate that they're an incomplete set of results.

## Search modifiers

### :not

`:not` allows you to find resources where an attribute is not true. For example, you could search for patients where the gender is not female:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?gender:not=female

```

As a return value, you would get all patient entries where the gender is not female, including empty values (entries specified without gender). This is different than searching for Patients where gender is male, since that would not include the entries without a specific gender.

### :missing

`:missing` returns all resources that don't have a value for the specified element when the value is `true`, and returns all the resources that contain the specified element when the value is `false`. For simple data type elements, `:missing=true` will match on all resources where the element is present with extensions but has an empty value. For example, if you want to find all `Patient` resources that are missing information on birth date, you can do:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?birthDate:missing=true

```

### :exact
`:exact` is used for `string` parameters, and returns results that match the parameter precisely, such as in casing and character concatenating.

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?name:exact=Jon

```

This request returns `Patient` resources that have the name exactly the same as `Jon`. If the resource had Patients with names such as `Jonathan` or `joN`, the search would ignore and skip the resource as it does not exactly match the specified value.

### :contains
`:contains` is used for `string` parameters and searches for resources with partial matches of the specified value anywhere in the string within the field being searched. `contains` is case insensitive and allows character concatenating. For example:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?address:contains=Meadow

```

This request would return you all `Patient` resources with `address` fields that have values that contain the string "Meadow". This means you could have addresses that include values such as "Meadowers" or "59 Meadow ST" returned as search results.

## Chained search 

To perform a series of search operations that cover multiple reference parameters, you can "chain" the series of reference parameters by appending them to the server request one by one using a period `.`. For example, if you want to view all `DiagnosticReport` resources with a `subject` reference to a `Patient` resource that includes a particular `name`:  

```rest
 GET [your-fhir-server]/DiagnosticReport?subject:Patient.name=Sarah

```

This request would return all the resources with the patient subject named "Sarah". The period `.` after the field `Patient` performs the chained search on the reference parameter of the `subject` parameter.

Another common use of chained search is finding all encounters for a specific patient. `Patient`s will often have one or more `Encounter`s with a subject. To search for all `Encounter` resources for a `Patient` with the provided `id`:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Encounter?subject=Patient/78a14cbe-8968-49fd-a231-d43e6619399f

```

Using chained search, you can find all the `Encounter` resources that matches a particular piece of `Patient` information, such as the `birthdate`:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Encounter?subject:Patient.birthDate=1987-02-20

```

This would allow not just searching `Encounter` resources for a single patient, but across all patients that have the specified birth date value. 

In addition, chained search can be done more than once in one request by using the symbol `&`, which allows you to search for multiple conditions in one request. In such cases, chained search "independently" searches for each parameter, instead of searching for conditions that only satisfy all the conditions at once. It's an OR operation, not an AND operation. For instance, if you want to get all patients who had a practitioner with a certain name or from a particular state:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?general-practitioner.name=Sarah&general-practitioner.address-state=WA

```

This would return all `Patient` resources that have "Sarah" as the `generalPractitioner`, and all `Patient` resources that have `generalPractitioner` that have the address with the state WA. In other words, you can have Sarah from the state NY and Bill from the state WA both as the returned results. Chained search doesn't require meeting all conditions and is evaluated individually per the parameter.

For scenarios in which the search has to be an AND operation that covers all conditions as a group, refer to the **composite search** example below.

## Reverse chain search

Chain search lets you search for resources based on the properties of resources they refer to. Using reverse chain search, allows you do it the other way around. You can search for resources based on the properties of resources that refer to them, using `_has` parameter. For example, `Observation` resource has a search parameter `patient` referring to a Patient resource. To find all Patient resources that are referenced by `Observation` with a specific `code`:

```rest
GET [base]/Patient?_has:Observation:patient:code=527

```

This request returns Patient resources that are referred by `Observation` with the code `527`. 

In addition, reverse chain search can have a recursive structure. For example, if you want to search for all patients that have `Observation` where the observation has an audit event from a specific user `janedoe`, you could do:

```rest
GET [base]/Patient?_has:Observation:patient:_has:AuditEvent:entity:user=janedoe

``` 

> [!NOTE]
> In the Azure API for FHIR and the open-source FHIR server backed by Cosmos, the chained search and reverse chained search is an MVP implementation. To accomplish chained search on Cosmos DB, the implementation walks down the search expression and issues sub-queries to resolve the matched resources. This is done for each level of the expression. If any query returns more than 100 results, an error will be thrown. By default, chained search is behind a feature flag. To use the chained searching on Cosmos DB, use the header x-ms-enable-chained-search: true.

## Composite search

To search for resources that meet multiple conditions at once, use composite search that joins a sequence of single parameter values with a symbol `$`. The returned result would be the intersection of the resources that match all of the conditions specified by the joined search parameters. Such search parameters are called composite search parameters, and they define a new parameter that combines the multiple parameters in a nested structure. For example, if you want to find all `DiagnosticReport` resources that contain `Observation` with a potassium value less than or equal to 9.2:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/DiagnosticReport?result.code-value-quantity=2823-3$lt9.2

``` 

This request specifies the component containing a code of `2823-3`, which in this case would be potassium. Following the `$` symbol, it specifies the range of the value for the component using `lt` for "less than or equal to" and `9.2` for the potassium value range. 

## Search the next entry set

The maximum number of entries that can be returned per a single search query is 1000. However, you might have more than 1000 entries that match the search query, and you might want to see the next set of entries after the first 1000 entries that were returned. In such case, you would use the continuation token `url` value in `searchset` as in the `Bundle` result below:

```json
    "resourceType": "Bundle",
    "id": "98731cb7-3a39-46f3-8a72-afe945741bd9",
    "meta": {
        "lastUpdated": "2021-04-22T09:58:16.7823171+00:00"
    },
    "type": "searchset",
    "link": [
        {
            "relation": "next",
            "url": "[your-fhir-server]/Patient?_sort=_lastUpdated&ct=WzUxMDAxNzc1NzgzODc5MjAwODBd"
        },
        {
            "relation": "self",
            "url": "[your-fhir-server]/Patient?_sort=_lastUpdated"
        }
    ],

```

And you would do a GET request for the provided URL under the field `relation: next`:

```rest
GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?_sort=_lastUpdated&ct=WzUxMDAxNzc1NzgzODc5MjAwODBd

```

This will return the next set of entries for your search result. The `searchset` is the complete set of search result entries, and the continuation token `url` is the link provided by the server for you to retrieve the entries that don't show up on the first set because the restriction on the maximum number of entries returned for a search query.

## Search using POST

All of the search examples mentioned above have used `GET` requests. You can also do search operations using `POST` requests using `_search`:

```rest
POST [your-fhir-server]/Patient/_search?_id=45

```

This request would return all `Patient` resources with the `id` value of 45. Just as in GET requests, the server determines which of the set of resources meets the condition(s), and returns a bundle resource in the HTTP response.

Another example of searching using POST where the query parameters are submitted as a form body is:

```rest
POST [your-fhir-server]/Patient/_search
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=John

```
