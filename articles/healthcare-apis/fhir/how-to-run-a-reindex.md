# Running a reindex job

There are scenarios where you may have search or sort parameters in the Azure API for FHIR that haven't yet been indexed. This is particularly relevant when you define your own search parameters. Until the search parameter is indexed, it can't be used in search. This article covers an overview of how to run a reindex job to index any search or sort parameters that have not yet been indexed in your database.

> [!Warning]
> It's important that you read this entire article before getting started. A reindex job can be very performance intensive. This article includes options for how to throttle and control the reindex job.

## How to run a reindex job 

To start a reindex job, use the following code example:

```json
POST {{FHIR URL}}/$reindex 

{ 

“resourceType”: “Parameters”,  

“parameter”: [] 

}
 ```

If the request is successful, a status of **201 Created** gets returned. The result of this message will look like:

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created 
Content-Location: https://cv-cosmos1.azurewebsites.net/_operations/reindex/560c7c61-2c70-4c54-b86d-c53a9d29495e 

{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "560c7c61-2c70-4c54-b86d-c53a9d29495e",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "\"4c0049cd-0000-0100-0000-607dc5a90000\""
  },
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "valueString": "560c7c61-2c70-4c54-b86d-c53a9d29495e"
    },
    {
      "name": "queuedTime",
      "valueDateTime": "2021-04-19T18:02:17.0118558+00:00"
    },
    {
      "name": "totalResourcesToReindex",
      "valueDecimal": 0.0
    },
    {
      "name": "resourcesSuccessfullyReindexed",
      "valueDecimal": 0.0
    },
    {
      "name": "progress",
      "valueDecimal": 0.0
    },
    {
      "name": "status",
      "valueString": "Queued"
    },
    {
      "name": "maximumConcurrency",
      "valueDecimal": 1.0
    },
    {
      "name": "resources",
      "valueString": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "searchParams",
      "valueString": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To check the status of or to cancel a reindex job, you’ll need the reindex ID. This is the ID of the resulting Parameters resource (shown above) and can also be found as the GUID at the end of the Content-Location string:

`https://{{FHIR URL}}/_operations/reindex/560c7c61-2c70-4c54-b86d-c53a9d29495e`

 ## How to check the status of a reindex job

Once you’ve started a reindex job, you can check the status of the job using the following:

`GET {{FHIR URL}}/_operations/reindex/{{reindexJobId}`

The status of the reindex job result is shown below:

```json
{

  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "id": "b65fd841-1c62-47c6-898f-c9016ced8f77",
  "meta": {

    "versionId": "\"1800f05f-0000-0100-0000-607a1a7c0000\""
  },
  "parameter": [

    {

      "name": "id",
      "valueString": "b65fd841-1c62-47c6-898f-c9016ced8f77"
    },
    {

      "name": "startTime",
      "valueDateTime": "2021-04-16T23:11:35.4223217+00:00"
    },
    {

      "name": "queuedTime",
      "valueDateTime": "2021-04-16T23:11:29.0288163+00:00"
    },
    {

      "name": "totalResourcesToReindex",
      "valueDecimal": 262544.0
    },
    {

      "name": "resourcesSuccessfullyReindexed",
      "valueDecimal": 5754.0
    },
    {

      "name": "progress",
      "valueDecimal": 2.0
    },
    {

      "name": "status",
      "valueString": "Running"
    },
    {

      "name": "maximumConcurrency",
      "valueDecimal": 1.0
    },
    {

      "name": "resources",
      "valueString": 
      "{LIST OF IMPACTED RESOURCES}"
    },
    {
```

The following information is shown in the reindex job result:

* **totalResourcesToReindex**: Includes the total number of resources that are being reindexed as part of the job.

* **resourcesSuccessfullyReindexed**: The total that have already been successfully reindexed.

* **progress**: Reindex job percent complete. Equals resourcesSuccessfullyReindexed/totalResourcesToReindex x 100.

* **status**: This will state if the reindex job is queued, running, complete, failed, or canceled.

* **resources**: This lists all the resource types impacted by the reindex job.

## Delete a reindex job

If you need to cancel a reindex job, use a delete call and specify the reindex job ID:

`Delete {{FHIR URL}}/_operations/reindex/{{reindexJobId}`

## Performance considerations

A reindex job can be quite performance intensive. We’ve implemented some throttling controls to help you manage how a reindex job will run on your database.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not uncommon on large datasets for a reindex job to run for days. For a database with 30,000,000 million resources, we noticed that it took 4-5 days at 100K RUs to reindex the entire database.

Below is a table outlining the available parameters, defaults, and recommended ranges. You can use these parameters to either speed up the process (use more compute) or slow down the process (use less compute). For example, you could run the reindex job on a low traffic time and increase your compute to get it done quicker. Instead, you could use the settings to ensure a very low usage of compute and have it run for days in the background. 

| **Parameter**                     | **Description**              | **Default**        | **Recommended Range**           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| QueryDelayIntervalInMilliseconds  | This is the delay between each batch of resources being kicked off during the reindex job. | 500 MS (.5 seconds) | 50 to 5000: 50 will speed up the reindex job and 5000 will slow it down from the default. |
| MaximumResourcesPerQuery  | This is the maximum number of resources included in the batch of resources to be reindexed.  | 100 | 1-500 |
| MaximumConcurreny  | This is the number of batches done at a time.  | 1 | 1-5 |
| targetDataStoreUsagePercentrage | This allows you to specify what percent of your data store to use for the reindex job. For example, you could specify 50% and that would ensure that at most the reindex job would use 50% of available RUs on Cosmos DB.  | No present, which means that up to 100% can be used. | 1-100 |

If you want to use any of the parameters above, you can pass them into the Parameters resource when you start the reindex job.

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "maximumConcurrency",
      "valueInteger": "3"
    },
    {
      "name": "targetDataStoreUsagePercentage",
      "valueInteger": "20"
    },
    {
      "name": "queryDelayIntervalInMilliseconds",
      "valueInteger": "1000"
    },
    {
      "name": "maximumNumberOfResourcesPerQuery",
      "valueInteger": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```
