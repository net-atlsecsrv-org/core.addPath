# Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) troubleshooting guide

This article provides steps for troubleshooting common Azure IoT Connector for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)* error messages and conditions.  

You'll also learn how to create copies of the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR conversion mappings JSON (for example: Device and FHIR).  

You can use the conversion mapping JSON copies for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal.  

> [!TIP]
> If you'll be opening a [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR, make sure to include copies of your conversion mapping JSON to help with the troubleshooting process.

## Device and FHIR Conversion Mapping JSON Template Validations for Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview)
In this section, you'll learn about the validation process that Azure IoT Connector for FHIR performs to validate the Device and FHIR conversion mapping JSON templates before allowing them to be saved for use.  These elements are required in the Device and FHIR Conversion Mapping JSON.

**Device Mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:-------|:------|
|TypeName|True|
|TypeMatchExpression|True|
|DeviceIdExpression|True|
|TimestampExpression|True|
|Values[].ValueName|True|
|Values[].ValueExpression|True|

> [!NOTE]
> Values[].ValueName and Values[].ValueExpression
>
> These elements are only required if you have a value entry in the array - it is valid to have no values mapped. This is used when the telemetry being sent is an event. For example: When a wearable IoMT device is put on or removed. The element(s) do not have any values except for a name that Azure IoT Connector for FHIR  matches and emits. On the FHIR conversion, Azure IoT Connector for FHIR maps it to a code-able concept based on the semantic type - no actual values are populated.

**FHIR Mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:------|:-------|
|TypeName|True|

> [!NOTE]
> This is the only required FHIR Mapping element validated at this time.

|The Device.patient reference isn't set, or the reference is invalid (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Make sure the Device Resource contains a valid [Reference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.patient) to a Patient Resource.| 

*Reference [Quickstart: Deploy Azure IoT Connector (preview) using Azure portal](iot-fhir-portal-quickstart.md#create-new-azure-iot-connector-for-fhir-preview) for a functional description of the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR resolution types (For example: Lookup or Create).

## Use Metrics to troubleshoot issues in Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview)

Azure IoT Connector for FHIR generates multiple metrics to provide insights into the data flow process. One of the supported metrics is called *Total Errors*, which provides the count for all errors that occur within an instance of Azure IoT Connector for FHIR.

Each error gets logged with a number of associated properties. Every property provides a different aspect about the error, which could help you to identify and troubleshoot issues. This section lists different properties captured for each error in the *Total Errors* metric, and possible values for these properties.

> [!NOTE]
> You can navigate to the *Total Errors* metric for an instance of Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) as described on the [Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) Metrics page](iot-metrics-display.md).

Click on the *Total Errors* graph and then click on *Add filter* button to slice and dice the error metric using any of the properties mentioned below.

### The operation performed by the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview)

This property represents the operation being performed by IoT Connector when the error has occurred. An operation generally represents the data flow stage while processing a device message. Here is the list of possible values for this property.

> [!NOTE]
> You can read more about different stages of data flow in Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) [here](iot-data-flow.md).

|Data flow stage|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|Setup|Operation specific to setting up your instance of IoT Connector|
|Normalization|Data flow stage where device data gets normalized|
|Grouping|Data flow stage where normalized data gets grouped|
|FHIRConversion|Data flow stage where grouped-normalized data is transformed into a FHIR resource|
|Unknown|The operation type is unknown when error occurred|

### The severity of the error

This property represents the severity of the occurred error. Here is the list of possible values for this property.

|Severity|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|Warning|Some minor issue exists in the data flow process, but processing of the device message doesn't stop|
|Error|Processing of a specific device message has run into an error and other messages may continue to execute as expected|
|Critical|Some system level issue exists with the IoT Connector and no messages are expected to process|

### The type of the error

This property signifies a category for a given error, which basically represents a logical grouping for similar type of errors. Here is the list of possible value for this property.

|Error type|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|DeviceTemplateError|Errors related to device mapping templates|
|DeviceMessageError|Errors occurred when processing a specific device message|

## Creating copies of the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) conversion mapping JSON

The copying of Azure IoT Connector for FHIR mapping files can be useful for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal website.

The mapping file copies should be provided to Azure Technical Support when opening a support ticket to assist in troubleshooting.

> [!NOTE]
> JSON is the only supported format for Device and FHIR mapping files at this time.
