# Get access token for Azure API for FHIR using Azure CLI

In this article, you'll learn how to obtain an access token for the Azure API for FHIR using the Azure CLI. When you [provision the Azure API for FHIR](fhir-paas-portal-quickstart.md), you configure a set of users or service principals that have access to the service. If your user object ID is in the list of allowed object IDs, you can access the service using a token obtained using the Azure CLI.

## Sign in with Azure CLI

Before you can obtain a token, you need to sign in with the user that you want to obtain a token for:

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

## Obtain a token

The Azure API for FHIR uses a `resource`  or `Audience` with URI equal to the URI of the FHIR server `https://<FHIR ACCOUNT NAME>.azurehealthcareapis.com`. You can obtain a token and store it in a variable (named `$token`) with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
token=$(az account get-access-token --resource=https://<FHIR ACCOUNT NAME>.azurehealthcareapis.com --query accessToken --output tsv)
```

## Use with Azure API for FHIR

```azurecli-interactive
curl -X GET --header "Authorization: Bearer $token" https://<FHIR ACCOUNT NAME>.azurehealthcareapis.com/Patient
```
