# Add data to audit logs via custom HTTP headers

## Concepts

A caller of the Azure FHIR API may want to include additional information in the logs, which comes from the calling system.  An example would be when the user of the API is authenticated by an external system, which then forwards the call to the FHIR API.  Once at the FHIR API layer, the information about the original user has been lost due to the call being forwarded.  It may be necessary to log and retain this user information for auditing or management purposes.  The calling system can provide user identify, caller location or other necessary information in the HTTP headers, which will be carried along as the call is forwarded.

You can see a diagram of the data flow below.

There are several ways to use custom headers when calling APIs. For example:

* Identity or authorization information
* Origin of the caller
* Originating organization
* Client system details (EHR, patient portal)

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that the information sent in custom headers will be stored in Microsoft internal logging system for 30 days after being available in Azure Log Monitoring. We recommend encrypting any sensitive information (PHI/PII information) before adding it to custom headers.  

## How to use custom headers

Any HTTP header named with the following convention: X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-AUDIT-<name> will be included in a property bag that is added to the log. Examples:

* X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERID: 1234 
* X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERLOCATION: XXXX
* X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-XYZ: 1234

This information will then be serialized to JSON when added to the properties column in the log.  Example:

```json
{ “X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERID” : “1234”,
“X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERLOCATION” : “XXXX”,
“X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-XYZ” : “1234” }
```
 
As with any HTTP header the same header name may be repeated with different values. Example:

* X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERLOCATION: HospitalA
* X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERLOCATION: Emergency

When added to the log the values with be combined a comma delimited list. Example:

{ “X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-USERLOCATION” : “HospitalA, Emergency” }
 
A maximum of 10 unique headers may be added (repetitions of the same header with different values would only be counted as one).
 
The total maximum length of the value for any one header is 2048 characters.

If you are using Firely C# client API library, then the code looks something like this:

```C#
FhirClient client;
client = new FhirClient(serverUrl);
client.OnBeforeRequest += (object sender, BeforeRequestEventArgs e) =>
{
    // Add custom headers to be added to the logs
    e.RawRequest.Headers.Add("X-MS-AZUREFHIR-AUDIT-UserLocation", "HospitalA");
};
client.Get("Patient");
```
