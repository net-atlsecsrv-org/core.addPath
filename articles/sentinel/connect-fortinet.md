# Connect Fortinet to Azure Sentinel



This article explains how to connect your Fortinet appliance to Azure Sentinel. The Fortinet data connector allows you to easily connect your Fortinet logs with Azure Sentinel, to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. Using Fortinet on Azure Sentinel will provide you more insights into your organization’s Internet usage, and will enhance its security operation capabilities.​ 


## How it works

You need to deploy an agent on a dedicated Linux machine (VM or on premises) to support the communication between Fortinet and Azure Sentinel. The following diagram describes the setup in the event of a Linux VM in Azure.

Alternatively, this setup will exist if you use a VM in another cloud, or an on-premises machine.

## Security considerations

Make sure to configure the machine's security according to your organization's security policy. For example, you can configure your network to align with your corporate network security policy and change the ports and protocols in the daemon to align with your requirements. You can use the following instructions to improve your machine security configuration:  [Secure VM in Azure](../virtual-machines/linux/security-policy.md), [Best practices for Network security](../security/fundamentals/network-best-practices.md).

To use TLS communication between the security solution and the Syslog machine, you will need to configure the Syslog daemon (rsyslog or syslog-ng) to communicate in TLS: [Encrypting Syslog Traffic with TLS -rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/tls_cert_summary.html), [Encrypting log messages with TLS –syslog-ng](https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.22/administration-guide/60#TOPIC-1209298).

 
## Prerequisites
Make sure the Linux machine you use as a proxy is running one of the following operating systems:

- 64-bit
  - CentOS 6 and 7
  - Amazon Linux 2017.09
  - Oracle Linux 6 and 7
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6 and 7
  - Debian GNU/Linux 8 and 9
  - Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
- 32-bit
   - CentOS 6
   - Oracle Linux 6
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6
   - Debian GNU/Linux 8 and 9
   - Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS
 
 - Daemon versions
   - Syslog-ng: 2.1 - 3.22.1
   - Rsyslog: v8
  
 - Syslog RFCs supported
   - Syslog RFC 3164
   - Syslog RFC 5424
 
Make sure your machine also meets the following requirements: 
- Permissions
    - You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine. 
- Software requirements
    - Make sure you have Python running on your machine
## STEP 1: Deploy the agent

In this step, you need to select the Linux machine that will act as a proxy between Azure Sentinel and your security solution. You will have to run a script on the proxy machine that:
- Installs the Log Analytics agent and configures it as needed to listen for Syslog messages on port 514 over TCP and send the CEF messages to your Azure Sentinel workspace.
- Configures the Syslog daemon to forward CEF messages to the Log Analytics agent using port 25226.
- Sets the Syslog agent to collect the data and send it securely to Log Analytics, where it is parsed and enriched.
 
 
1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select **Fortinet** and then **Open connector page**. 

1. Under **Install and configure the Syslog agent**, select your machine type, either Azure, other cloud, or on-premises. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > Because the script in the next step installs the Log Analytics agent and connects the machine to your Azure Sentinel workspace, make sure this machine is not connected to any other workspace.
1. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine. Make sure that you have Python on your machine using the following command: `python –version`

1. Run the following script on your proxy machine.
   `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_installer.py&&sudo python cef_installer.py [WorkspaceID] [Workspace Primary Key]`
1. While the script is running, check to make sure you don't get any error or warning messages.

 
## Step 2: Forward Fortinet logs to the Syslog agent

Configure Fortinet to forward Syslog messages in CEF format to your Azure workspace via the Syslog agent.

1. Open the CLI on your Fortinet appliance and run the following commands:

        config log syslogd setting
        set format cef
        set port 514
        set reliable disable
        set server <ip_address_of_Receiver>
        set status enable
        end

    - Replace the server **ip address** with the IP address of the agent.
    - Set the **syslog port** to **514** or the port set on the agent.
    - To enable CEF format in early FortiOS versions, you might need to run the command set **csv disable**.
 
   > [!NOTE] 
   > For more information, go to the [Fortinet document library](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-fortinet-fortinetdocumentlibrary). Select your version, and use the **Handbook** and **Log Message Reference**.

 To use the relevant schema in Azure Monitor Log Analytics for the Fortinet events, search for `CommonSecurityLog`.


## STEP 3: Validate connectivity

1. Open Log Analytics to make sure that logs are received using the CommonSecurityLog schema.<br> It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics. 

1. Before you run the script, we recommend that you send messages from your security solution to make sure they are being forwarded to the Syslog proxy machine you configured. 
1. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine. Make sure that you have Python on your machine using the following command: `python –version`
1. Run the following script to check connectivity between the agent, Azure Sentinel, and your security solution. It checks that the daemon forwarding is properly configured, listens on the correct ports, and that nothing is blocking communication between the daemon and the Log Analytics agent. The script also sends mock messages 'TestCommonEventFormat' to check end-to-end connectivity. <br>
 `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_troubleshoot.py&&sudo python cef_troubleshoot.py [WorkspaceID]`
