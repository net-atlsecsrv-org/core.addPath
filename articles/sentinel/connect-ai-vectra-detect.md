# Connect AI Vectra Detect to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AI Vectra Detect data connector in Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This article explains how to connect your [AI Vectra Detect](https://www.vectra.ai/product/cognito-detect) appliance to Azure Sentinel. The AI Vectra Detect data connector allows you to easily bring your AI Vectra Detect data into Azure Sentinel, so that you can view it in workbooks, use it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve investigation.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Configure your AI Vectra Detect appliance to send CEF messages  

Configure AI Vectra Detect to forward CEF-formatted Syslog messages to your Log Analytics workspace via the Syslog forwarder you set up in [STEP 1: Deploy the log forwarder](connect-cef-agent.md).

1. From the Vectra interface, navigate to Settings > Notifications and choose Edit Syslog configuration. Follow the instructions below to set up the connection:

    - Add a new Destination (the hostname of the [log forwarder](connect-cef-agent.md))
    - Set the Port as **514**
    - Set the Protocol as **UDP**
    - Set the format to **CEF**
    - Set Log types (select all log types available)
    - Click on **Save**

2. You can click the **Test** button to force the sending of some test events to the log forwarder.

3. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the AI Vectra Detect events, search for **CommonSecurityLog**.

4. Continue to [STEP 3: Validate connectivity](connect-cef-verify.md).
