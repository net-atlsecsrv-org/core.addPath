# Connect your Pulse Connect Secure to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Pulse Connect Secure data connector in Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
