# Connect data from Microsoft 365 Defender to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Microsoft 365 Defender** was formerly known as **Microsoft Threat Protection** or **MTP**.
>
> **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** was formerly known as **Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection** or **MDATP**.
>
> You may see the old names still in use for a period of time.

## Background

Azure Sentinel's [Microsoft 365 Defender (M365D)](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-threat-protection) connector with incident integration allows you to stream all M365D incidents and alerts into Azure Sentinel, and keeps the incidents synchronized between both portals. M365D incidents include all their alerts, entities, and other relevant information, and they are enriched by and group together alerts from M365D's component services **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, **Microsoft Defender for Identity**, **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**, and **Microsoft Cloud App Security**.

The connector also lets you stream **advanced hunting** events from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint into Azure Sentinel, allowing you to copy MDE advanced hunting queries into Azure Sentinel, enrich Sentinel alerts with MDE raw event data to provide additional insights, and store the logs with increased retention in Log Analytics.

For more information about incident integration and advanced hunting event collection, see [Microsoft 365 Defender integration with Azure Sentinel](microsoft-365-defender-sentinel-integration.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Microsoft 365 Defender connector is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a valid license for Microsoft 365 Defender, as described in [Microsoft 365 Defender prerequisites](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/prerequisites). 

- You must be a **global administrator** or a **security administrator** in Azure Active Directory.

## Connect to Microsoft 365 Defender

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors**, select **Microsoft 365 Defender (Preview)** from the gallery and select **Open connector page**.

1. Under **Configuration** in the **Connect incidents & alerts** section, click the **Connect incidents & alerts** button.

1. To avoid duplication of incidents, it is recommended to mark the check box labeled **Turn off all Microsoft incident creation rules for these products.**

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you enable the Microsoft 365 Defender connector, all of the M365D components’ connectors (the ones mentioned at the beginning of this article) are automatically connected in the background. In order to disconnect one of the components’ connectors, you must first disconnect the Microsoft 365 Defender connector.

1. To query M365 Defender incident data, use the following statement in the query window:
    ```kusto
    SecurityIncident
    | where ProviderName == "Microsoft 365 Defender"
    ```

1. If you want to collect advanced hunting events from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, the  following types of events can be collected from their corresponding advanced hunting tables.

    1. Mark the check boxes of the tables with the event types you wish to collect:

       | Table name | Events type |
       |-|-|
       | DeviceInfo | Machine information (including OS information) |
       | DeviceNetworkInfo | Network properties of machines |
       | DeviceProcessEvents | Process creation and related events |
       | DeviceNetworkEvents | Network connection and related events |
       | DeviceFileEvents | File creation, modification, and other file system events |
       | DeviceRegistryEvents | Creation and modification of registry entries |
       | DeviceLogonEvents | Sign-ins and other authentication events |
       | DeviceImageLoadEvents | DLL loading events |
       | DeviceEvents | Additional events types |
       | DeviceFileCertificateInfo | Certificate information of signed files |
       |

    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

    1. To query the advanced hunting tables in Log Analytics, enter the table name from the list above in the query window.

## Verify data ingestion

The data graph in the connector page indicates that you are ingesting data. You'll notice that it shows one line each for incidents, alerts, and events, and the events line is an aggregation of event volume across all enabled tables. Once you have enabled the connector, you can use the following KQL queries to generate more specific graphs.

Use the following KQL query for a graph of the incoming M365 Defender incidents:

```kusto
let Now = now(); 
(range TimeGenerated from ago(14d) to Now-1d step 1d 
| extend Count = 0 
| union isfuzzy=true ( 
    SecurityIncident
    | where ProviderName == "Microsoft 365 Defender"
    | summarize Count = count() by bin_at(TimeGenerated, 1d, Now) 
) 
| summarize Count=max(Count) by bin_at(TimeGenerated, 1d, Now) 
| sort by TimeGenerated 
| project Value = iff(isnull(Count), 0, Count), Time = TimeGenerated, Legend = "Events") 
| render timechart 
```

Use the following KQL query to generate a graph of event volume for a single table (change the *DeviceEvents* table to the required table of your choosing):

```kusto
let Now = now();
(range TimeGenerated from ago(14d) to Now-1d step 1d
| extend Count = 0
| union isfuzzy=true (
    DeviceEvents
    | summarize Count = count() by bin_at(TimeGenerated, 1d, Now)
)
| summarize Count=max(Count) by bin_at(TimeGenerated, 1d, Now)
| sort by TimeGenerated
| project Value = iff(isnull(Count), 0, Count), Time = TimeGenerated, Legend = "Events")
| render timechart
```

In the **Next steps** tab, you’ll find some useful workbooks, sample queries, and analytics rule templates that have been included. You can run them on the spot or modify and save them.
