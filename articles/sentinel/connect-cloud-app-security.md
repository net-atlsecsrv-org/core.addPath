# Connect data from Microsoft Cloud App Security 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can stream logs from [Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) into Azure Sentinel with a single click. This connection enables you to stream the alerts from Cloud App Security into Azure Sentinel. 

## Prerequisites

- User with global administrator or security administrator permissions

## Connect to Cloud App Security

If you already have Cloud App Security, make sure it is [enabled on your network](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/getting-started-with-cloud-app-security).
If Cloud App Security is deployed and ingesting your data, the alert data can easily be streamed into Azure Sentinel.


1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then click the **Cloud App Security** tile.

2. Click **Connect**.

3. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Cloud App Security alerts, search for **SecurityAlert**.
