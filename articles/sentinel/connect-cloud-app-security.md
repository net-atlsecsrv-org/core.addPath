# Connect data from Microsoft Cloud App Security 



You can stream logs from [Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) into Azure Sentinel with a single click. This connection enables you to stream the alerts from Cloud App Security into Azure Sentinel. 

## Prerequisites

- User with global administrator or security administrator permissions

## Connect to Cloud App Security

If you already have Cloud App Security, make sure it is [enabled on your network](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/getting-started-with-cloud-app-security).
If Cloud App Security is deployed and ingesting your data, the alert data can easily be streamed into Azure Sentinel.


1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then click the **Cloud App Security** tile.

1. Select which logs you want to stream into Azure Sentinel, you can choose **Alerts**. 

1. You can select whether you want the alerts from Microsoft Cloud App Security to automatically generate incidents in Azure Sentinel automatically. Under **Create incidents** select **Enable** to enable the default analytic rule that creates incidents automatically from alerts generated in the connected security service. You can then edit this rule under **Analytics** and then **Active rules**.

1. Click **Connect**.

1. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Cloud App Security alerts, search for **SecurityAlert**.
