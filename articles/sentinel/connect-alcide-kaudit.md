# Connect your Alcide kAudit to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Alcide kAudit data connector in Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

[Alcide kAudit](https://www.alcide.io/kaudit-K8s-forensics/) helps you identify anomalous Kubernetes behaviors and focus on Kubernetes breaches and incidents while reducing detection time. This article explains how to connect your Alcide kAudit solution to Azure Sentinel. The Alcide kAudit data connector allows you to easily bring your kAudit log data into Azure Sentinel, so that you can view it in workbooks, use it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve investigation. Integration between Alcide kAudit and Azure Sentinel makes use of REST API.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Prerequisites

- You must have read and write permissions on the Azure Sentinel workspace.

- You must have read permissions to shared keys for the workspace.

## Configure and connect Alcide kAudit

Alcide kAudit can export logs directly to Azure Sentinel.

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** on the navigation menu.

1. Select **Alcide kAudit** from the gallery, and then click the **Open connector page** button.

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in **Logs** under the following data types in **CustomLogs**:

- **alcide_kaudit_detections_1_CL** - Alcide kAudit detections 
- **alcide_kaudit_activity_1_CL** - Alcide kAudit activity logs
- **alcide_kaudit_selections_count_1_CL** - Alcide kAudit activity counts
- **alcide_kaudit_selections_details_1_CL** - Alcide kAudit activity details

To use the relevant schema in Logs for the Alcide kAudit, search for the data types mentioned above.

It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
