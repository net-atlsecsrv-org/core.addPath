# Connect your data from Azure Security Center for IoT to Azure Sentinel 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Security Center for IoT data connector is currently in public preview. This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Use the Azure Security Center for IoT connector to stream all your Azure Security Center for IoT events into Azure Sentinel. 

## Prerequisites

- **Read** and **Write** permissions on the Workspace onto which Azure Sentinel is deployed
- **Azure Security Center for IoT** must be **enabled** on your relevant IoT Hub(s)
- **Read** and **Write** permissions on the **Azure IoT Hub** you want to connect
- **Read** and **Write** permissions on the **Azure IoT Hub resource group**

> [!NOTE]
> While you must enable the Azure Security Center **Standard** tier license on your subscription to stream IoT resource alerts to Azure Sentinel, you only need to enable the Azure Security Center **Free** tier license on your subscription to view Azure Security Center for IoT alerts in Azure Sentinel. 

## Connect to Azure Security Center for IoT

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then click the **Azure Security Center for IoT** tile.
1. From the bottom right pane, click **Open connector page**. 
1. Click **Connect**, next to each IoT Hub subscription whose alerts and device alerts you want to stream into Azure Sentinel. 
    - If Azure Security Center for IoT is not enabled on that Hub, youâ€™ll see an **Enable** warning message. Click the **Enable** link to start the service. 
1. You can decide whether you want the alerts from Azure Security Center for IoT to automatically generate incidents in Azure Sentinel. Under **Create incidents**,  select **Enable** to enable the default analytic rule to create incidents automatically from alerts generated in the connected security service.This rule can be changed or edited under **Analytics** > **Active** rules.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take some time for the hub list to refresh after making connection changes. 

## Log Analytics alert display

To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics to display  the Azure Security Center for IoT alerts:

1. Open **Logs** > **SecurityInsights** > **SecurityAlert**, or search for **SecurityAlert**. 
2. Filter to see only Azure Security Center for IoT generated alerts using the following kql filter:

```kusto
SecurityAlert | where ProductName == "Azure Security Center for IoT"
``` 

### Service notes

After connecting an IoT Hub, the hub data is available in Azure Sentinel approximately 15 minutes later.
