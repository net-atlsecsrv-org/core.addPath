# Audit Azure Sentinel queries and activities

This article describes how you can view audit data for queries run and activities performed in your Azure Sentinel workspace, such as for internal and external compliance requirements in your Security Operations (SOC) workspace.

Azure Sentinel provides access to:

- The **AzureActivity** table, which provides details about all actions taken in Azure Sentinel, such as editing alert rules. The **AzureActivity** table does not log specific query data. For more information, see [Auditing with Azure Activity logs](#auditing-with-azure-activity-logs).

- The **LAQueryLogs** table, which provides details about the queries run in Log Analytics, including queries run from Azure Sentinel. For more information, see [Auditing with LAQueryLogs](#auditing-with-laquerylogs).

> [!TIP]
> In addition to the manual queries described in this article, Azure Sentinel provides a built-in workbook to help you audit the activities in your SOC environment.
>
> In the Azure Sentinel **Workbooks** area, search for the **Workspace audit** workbook.



## Auditing with Azure Activity logs

Azure Sentinel's audit logs are maintained in the [Azure Activity Logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md), where the **AzureActivity** table includes all actions taken in your Azure Sentinel workspace.

You can use the **AzureActivity** table when auditing activity in your SOC environment with Azure Sentinel.

**To query the AzureActivity table**:

1. Connect the [Azure Activity](connect-azure-activity.md) data source to start streaming audit events into a new table in the **Logs** screen called AzureActivity.

1. Then, query the data using KQL, like you would any other table.

    The **AzureActivity** table includes data from many services, including Azure Sentinel. To filter in only data from Azure Sentinel, start your query with the following code:

    ```kql
     AzureActivity
    | where OperationNameValue startswith "MICROSOFT.SECURITYINSIGHTS"
    ```

    For example, to find out who was the last user to edit a particular analytics rule, use the following query (replacing `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the rule ID of the rule you want to check):

    ```kusto
    AzureActivity
    | where OperationNameValue startswith "MICROSOFT.SECURITYINSIGHTS/ALERTRULES/WRITE"
    | where Properties contains "alertRules/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    | project Caller , TimeGenerated , Properties
    ```

Add more parameters to your query to explore the **AzureActivities** table further, depending on what you need to report. The following sections provide other sample queries to use when auditing with **AzureActivity** table data. 

For more information, see [Azure Sentinel data included in Azure Activity logs](#azure-sentinel-data-included-in-azure-activity-logs).

### Find all actions taken by a specific user in the last 24 hours

The following **AzureActivity** table query lists all actions taken by a specific Azure AD user in the last 24 hours.

```kql
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue contains "SecurityInsights"
| where Caller == "[AzureAD username]"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
```

### Find all delete operations

The following **AzureActivity** table query lists all the delete operations performed in your Azure Sentinel workspace.

```kql
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue contains "SecurityInsights"
| where OperationName contains "Delete"
| where ActivityStatusValue contains "Succeeded"
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, OperationName
``` 


### Azure Sentinel data included in Azure Activity logs
 
Azure Sentinel's audit logs are maintained in the [Azure Activity Logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md), and include the following types of information:

|Operation  |Information types  |
|---------|---------|
|**Created**     |Alert rules <br> Case comments <br>Incident comments <br>Saved searches<br>Watchlists    <br>Workbooks     |
|**Deleted**     |Alert rules <br>Bookmarks <br>Data connectors <br>Incidents <br>Saved searches <br>Settings <br>Threat intelligence reports <br>Watchlists      <br>Workbooks <br>Workflow  |
|**Updated**     |  Alert rules<br>Bookmarks <br> Cases <br> Data connectors <br>Incidents <br>Incident comments <br>Threat intelligence reports <br> Workbooks <br>Workflow       |
|     |         |

You can also use the Azure Activity logs to check for user authorizations and licenses. 

For example, the following table lists selected operations found in Azure Activity logs with the specific resource the log data is pulled from.

|Operation name|	Resource type|
|----|----|
|Create or update workbook	|Microsoft.Insights/workbooks|
|Delete workbook	|Microsoft.Insights/workbooks|
|Set workflow	|Microsoft.Logic/workflows|
|Delete workflow	|Microsoft.Logic/workflows|
|Create saved search	|Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/savedSearches|
|Delete saved search	|Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/savedSearches|
|Update alert rules	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/alertRules|
|Delete alert rules	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/alertRules|
|Update alert rule response actions	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/alertRules/actions|
|Delete alert rule response actions	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/alertRules/actions|
|Update bookmarks	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/bookmarks|
|Delete bookmarks	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/bookmarks|
|Update cases	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/Cases|
|Update case investigation	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/Cases/investigations|
|Create case comments	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/Cases/comments|
|Update data connectors	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/dataConnectors|
|Delete data connectors	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/dataConnectors|
|Update settings	|Microsoft.SecurityInsights/settings|
| | |

For more information, see [Azure Activity Log event schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).


## Auditing with LAQueryLogs

The **LAQueryLogs** table provides details about log queries run in Log Analytics. Since Log Analytics is used as Azure Sentinel's underlying data store, you can configure your system to collect LAQueryLogs data in your Azure Sentinel workspace.

LAQueryLogs data includes information such as:

- When queries were run
- Who ran queries in Log Analytics
- What tool was used to run queries in Log Analytics, such as Azure Sentinel
- The query texts themselves
- Performance data on each query run

> [!NOTE]
> - The **LAQueryLogs** table only includes queries that have been run in the Logs blade of Azure Sentinel. It does not include the queries run by scheduled analytics rules, using the **Investigation Graph** or in the Azure Sentinel **Hunting** page.
> - There may be a short delay between the time a query is run and the data is populated in the **LAQueryLogs** table. We recommend waiting about 5 minutes to query the **LAQueryLogs** table for audit data.
>


**To query the LAQueryLogs table**:

1. The **LAQueryLogs** table isn't enabled by default in your Log Analytics workspace. To use **LAQueryLogs** data when auditing in Azure Sentinel, first enable the **LAQueryLogs** in your Log Analytics workspace's **Diagnostics settings** area.

    For more information, see [Audit queries in Azure Monitor logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/query-audit).


1. Then, query the data using KQL, like you would any other table.

    For example, the following query shows how many queries were run in the last week, on a per-day basis:

    ```kql
    LAQueryLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
    | summarize events_count=count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
    ```

The following sections show more sample queries to run on the **LAQueryLogs** table when auditing activities in your SOC environment using Azure Sentinel.

### The number of queries run where the response wasn't "OK"

The following **LAQueryLogs** table query shows the number of queries run, where anything other than an HTTP response of **200 OK** was received. For example, this number will include queries that had failed to run.

```kql
LAQueryLogs
| where ResponseCode != 200 
| count 
```

### Show users for CPU-intensive queries

The following **LAQueryLogs** table query lists the users who ran the most CPU-intensive queries, based on CPU used and length of query time.

```kql
LAQueryLogs
|summarize arg_max(StatsCPUTimeMs, *) by AADClientId
| extend User = AADEmail, QueryRunTime = StatsCPUTimeMs
| project User, QueryRunTime, QueryText
| order by QueryRunTime desc
```

### Show users who ran the most queries in the past week

The following **LAQueryLogs** table query lists the users who ran the most queries in the last week.

```kql
LAQueryLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize events_count=count() by AADEmail
| extend UserPrincipalName = AADEmail, Queries = events_count
| join kind= leftouter (
    SigninLogs)
    on UserPrincipalName
| project UserDisplayName, UserPrincipalName, Queries
| summarize arg_max(Queries, *) by UserPrincipalName
| sort by Queries desc
```

## Configuring alerts for Azure Sentinel activities

You may want to use Azure Sentinel auditing resources to create proactive alerts.

For example, if you have sensitive tables in your Azure Sentinel workspace, use the following query to notify you each time those tables are queried:

```kql
LAQueryLogs
| where QueryText contains "[Name of sensitive table]"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| extend User = AADEmail, Query = QueryText
| project User, Query
```


## Next steps

In Azure Sentinel, use the **Workspace audit** workbook to audit the activities in your SOC environment.
