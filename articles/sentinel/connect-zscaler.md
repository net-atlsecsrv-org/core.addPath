# Connect Zscaler Internet Access to Azure Sentinel

This article explains how to connect your Zscaler Internet Access appliance to Azure Sentinel. The Zscaler data connector allows you to easily connect your Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) logs with Azure Sentinel, to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. Using Zscaler on Azure Sentinel will provide you more insights into your organization’s Internet usage, and will enhance its security operation capabilities.​ 


## Configure your Zscaler to send CEF messages

1. On the Zscaler appliance you need to set these values so that the appliance sends the necessary logs in the necessary format to the Azure Sentinel Syslog agent, based on the Log Analytics agent. You can modify these parameters in your appliance, as long as you also modify them in the Syslog daemon on the Azure Sentinel agent.
    - Protocol = TCP
    - Port = 514
    - Format = CEF
    - IP address - make sure to send the CEF messages to the IP address of the virtual machine you dedicated for this purpose.
 For more information, see the [Zscaler and Azure Sentinel Deployment Guide](https://aka.ms/ZscalerCEFInstructions).
 
   > [!NOTE]
   > This solution supports Syslog RFC 3164 or RFC 5424.


1. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the CEF events, search for `CommonSecurityLog`.
1. Continue to [STEP 3: Validate connectivity](connect-cef-verify.md).
