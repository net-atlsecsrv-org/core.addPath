# Connect your Aruba ClearPass to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Aruba ClearPass connector is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article explains how to connect your Aruba ClearPass appliance to Azure Sentinel. The Aruba ClearPass data connector allows you to easily connect your Aruba ClearPass logs with Azure Sentinel, so that you can view the data in workbooks, query it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve investigation. Integration between Aruba ClearPass and Azure Sentinel makes use of CEF-formatted Syslog, a Linux-based log forwarder, and the Log Analytics agent. It also uses a custom-built log parser based on a Kusto function.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Prerequisites

- You must have read and write permissions on your Azure Sentinel workspace.

- You must have read permissions to shared keys for the workspace. [Learn more about workspace keys](../azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent.md#workspace-id-and-key).

## Send Aruba ClearPass logs to Azure Sentinel

To get its logs into Azure Sentinel, configure your Aruba ClearPass appliance to send Syslog messages in CEF format to a Linux-based log forwarding server (running rsyslog or syslog-ng). This server will have the Log Analytics agent installed on it, and the agent forwards the logs to your Azure Sentinel workspace.

1. In the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select **Data connectors**.

1. From the **Data connectors** gallery, select **Aruba ClearPass (Preview)**, and then **Open connector page**.

1. Follow the instructions in the **Instructions** tab, under **Configuration**:

    1. Under **1. Linux Syslog agent configuration** - Do this step if you don't already have a log forwarder running, or if you need another one. See [STEP 1: Deploy the log forwarder](connect-cef-agent.md) in the Azure Sentinel documentation for more detailed instructions and explanation.

    1. Under **2. Forward Aruba ClearPass logs to a Syslog agent** - Follow Aruba's instructions to [configure ClearPass](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/6.7/PolicyManager/Content/CPPM_UserGuide/Admin/syslogExportFilters_add_syslog_filter_general.htm). This configuration should include the following elements:
        - Log destination – the hostname and/or IP address of your log forwarding server
        - Protocol and port – TCP 514 (if recommended otherwise, be sure to make the parallel change in the syslog daemon on your log forwarding server)
        - Log format – CEF
        - Log types – all available or all appropriate

    1. Under **3. Validate connection** - Verify data ingestion by copying the command on the connector page and running it on your log forwarder. See [STEP 3: Validate connectivity](connect-cef-verify.md) in the Azure Sentinel documentation for more detailed instructions and explanation.

        It may take up to 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in **Logs**, under the **Azure Sentinel** section, in the *CommonSecurityLog* table.

This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected. [Follow these steps](https://aka.ms/sentinel-arubaclearpass-parser) to create the **ArubaClearPass** Kusto function alias.

Then, to query Aruba ClearPass data in Log Analytics, enter `ArubaClearPass` at the top of the query window.

See the **Next steps** tab in the connector page for some useful query samples.
