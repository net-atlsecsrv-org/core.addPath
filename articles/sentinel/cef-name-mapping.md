# CEF and CommonSecurityLog field mapping

The following tables map Common Event Format (CEF) field names to the names they use in Azure Sentinel's CommonSecurityLog, and may be helpful when you are working with a CEF data source in Azure Sentinel.

## Unmapped fields

The following **CommonSecurityLog** field names don't have mappings in CEF keys:


|CommonSecurityLog field name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**OriginalLogSeverity**     |  Always empty, supported for integration with CiscoASA. <br>For details about log severity values, see the [LogSeverity](#logseverity) field.       |
|**RemoteIP**     |     The remote IP address. <br>This value is based on [CommunicationDirection](#communicationdirection) field, if possible.     |
|**RemotePort**     |   The remote port. <br>This value is based on [CommunicationDirection](#communicationdirection) field, if possible.      |
|**SimplifiedDeviceAction**     |   Simplifies the [DeviceAction](#deviceaction) value to a static set of values, while keeping the original value in the [DeviceAction](#deviceaction) field. <br>For example:  `Denied` > `Deny`.      |
