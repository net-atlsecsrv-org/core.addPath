# Azure Sentinel UEBA enrichments reference

These tables list and describe entity enrichments that can be used to focus and sharpen your investigation of security incidents.

The first two tables, **User insights** and **Device insights**, contain entity information from Active Directory / Azure AD and Microsoft Threat Intelligence sources.

<a name="baseline-explained"></a>The rest of the tables, under **Activity insights tables**, contain entity information based on the behavioral profiles built by Azure Sentinel's entity behavior analytics. The activities are analyzed against a baseline that is dynamically compiled each time it is used. Each activity has its defined lookback period from which this dynamic baseline is derived. This period is specified in the [**Baseline**](#activity-insights-tables) column in this table.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **Enrichment name** field in all three tables displays two rows of information. The first, in **bold**, is the "friendly name" of the enrichment. The second *(in italics and parentheses)* is the field name of the enrichment as stored in the [**Behavior Analytics table**](identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md#data-schema).
