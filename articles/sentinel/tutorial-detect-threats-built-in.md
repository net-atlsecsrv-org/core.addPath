# Tutorial: Detect threats out-of-the-box


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-the-box threat detection is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Once you have [connected your data sources](quickstart-onboard.md) to Azure Sentinel, you'll want to be notified when something suspicious occurs. That's why Azure Sentinel provides out-of-the-box, built-in templates to help you create threat detection rules. These templates were designed by Microsoft's team of security experts and analysts based on known threats, common attack vectors, and suspicious activity escalation chains. Rules created from these templates will automatically search across your environment for any activity that looks suspicious. Many of the templates can be customized to search for activities, or filter them out, according to your needs. The alerts generated by these rules will create incidents that you can assign and investigate in your environment.

This tutorial helps you detect threats with Azure Sentinel:

## About out-of-the-box detections

To view all the out-of-the-box detections, go to **Analytics** and then **Rule templates**. This tab contains all the Azure Sentinel built-in rules.

The following template types are available:

- **Microsoft security**
   
   Microsoft security templates automatically create Azure Sentinel incidents from the alerts generated in other Microsoft security solutions, in real time. You can use Microsoft security rules as a template to create new rules with similar logic. For more information about security rules, see [Automatically create incidents from Microsoft security alerts](create-incidents-from-alerts.md).

- **Fusion** 

    Based on Fusion technology, advanced multistage attack detection in Azure Sentinel uses scalable machine learning algorithms that can correlate many low-fidelity alerts and events across multiple products into high-fidelity and actionable incidents. Fusion is enabled by default. Because the logic is hidden and therefore not customizable, you can only create one rule with this template.

- **Machine learning behavioral analytics**

    These templates are based on proprietary Microsoft machine learning algorithms, so you cannot see the internal logic of how they work and when they run. Because the logic is hidden and therefore not customizable, you can only create one rule with each template of this type.

- **Scheduled**

    Scheduled analytics rules are based on built-in queries written by Microsoft security experts. You can see the query logic and make changes to it. You can use the scheduled rules template and customize the query logic and scheduling settings to create new rules.

## Use out-of-the-box detections

1. In order to use a built-in template, click the template name, and then click the **Create rule** button on the details pane to create a new active rule based on that template. Each template has a list of required data sources. When you open the template, the data sources are automatically checked for availability. If there is an availability issue, the **Create rule** button may be disabled, or you may see a warning to that effect.

1. Clicking the **Create rule** button opens the rule creation wizard based on the selected template. All the details are autofilled, and with the **Scheduled** or **Microsoft security** templates, you can customize the logic and other rule settings to better suit your specific needs. You can repeat this process to create additional rules based on the built-in template. After following the steps in the rule creation wizard to the end, you will have finished creating a rule based on the template. The new rules will appear in the **Active rules** tab.

    For more details on how to customize your rules in the rule creation wizard, see [Tutorial: Create custom analytics rules to detect threats](tutorial-detect-threats-custom.md).
