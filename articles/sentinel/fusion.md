# Advanced multistage attack detection in Azure Sentinel

By using Fusion technology thatâ€™s based on machine learning, Azure Sentinel can automatically detect multistage attacks by combining anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed at various stages of the kill-chain. Azure Sentinel then generates incidents that would otherwise be very difficult to catch. These incidents encase two or more alerts or activities. By design, these incidents are low volume, high fidelity, and high severity.

Customized for your environment, this detection not only reduces false positive rates but can also detect attacks with limited or missing information.

For details about the alerts for the scenarios supported, see the [Scenarios supported for multistage attack detection](#scenarios-supported-for-advanced-multistage-attack-detection) section on this page.

## Configuration for advanced multistage attack detection

This detection is enabled by default in Azure Sentinel. To check the status, or to disable it perhaps because you are using an alternative solution to create incidents based on multiple alerts, use the following instructions:

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to **Azure Sentinel** > **Configuration** > **Analytics**

3. Select **Active rules** and locate **Advanced Multistage Attack Detection** in the **NAME** column. Check the **STATUS** column to confirm whether this detection is enabled or disabled.

4. To change the status, select this entry and on the **Advanced Multistage Attack Detection** blade, select **Edit**.

5. On the **Rule creation wizard** blade, the change of status is automatically selected for you, so select **Next: Review**, and then **Save**. 

Rule templates are not applicable for the advanced multistage attack detection.

## Scenarios supported for advanced multistage attack detection

Using advanced multistage attack detection, Azure Sentinel supports the following scenarios that combine anomaly events from Azure Active Directory Identity Protection and Microsoft Cloud App Security:

- [Impossible travel to atypical location followed by anomalous Office 365 activity](#impossible-travel-to-atypical-location-followed-by-anomalous-office-365-activity)
- [Sign-in activity for unfamiliar location followed by anomalous Office 365 activity](#sign-in-activity-for-unfamiliar-location-followed-by-anomalous-office-365-activity)
- [Sign-in activity from infected device followed by anomalous Office 365 activity](#sign-in-activity-from-infected-device-followed-by-anomalous-office-365-activity)
- [Sign-in activity from anonymous IP address followed by anomalous Office 365 activity](#sign-in-activity-from-anonymous-ip-address-followed-by-anomalous-office-365-activity)
- [Sign-in activity from user with leaked credentials followed by anomalous Office 365 activity](#sign-in-activity-from-user-with-leaked-credentials-followed-by-anomalous-office-365-activity)

You must have the [Azure AD Identity Protection data connector](connect-azure-ad-identity-protection.md) and the [Cloud App Security](connect-cloud-app-security.md) connectors configured.

In the descriptions that follow, Azure Sentinel will display the actual value from your data that is represented on this page as variables in brackets. For example, the actual display name of an account rather than \<*account name*>, and the actual number rather than \<*number*>.

### Impossible travel to atypical location followed by anomalous Office 365 activity

There are seven possible Azure Sentinel incidents that combine impossible travel to atypical location alerts from Azure AD Identity Protection and anomalous Office 365 alerts generated by Microsoft Cloud App Security:

- **Impossible travel to atypical locations leading to Office 365 mailbox exfiltration**
    
    This alert is an indication of a sign-in event by \<*account name*>  from an impossible travel to \<*location*>, an atypical location, followed by a suspicious inbox forwarding rule was set on a user's inbox.
    
    This may indicate that the account is compromised, and that the mailbox is being used to exfiltrate information from your organization. The user \<*account name*> created or updated an inbox forwarding rule that forwards all incoming email to the external address \<*email address*>.

- **Impossible travel to atypical locations leading to suspicious cloud app administrative activity**
    
    This alert is an indication of a sign-in event by \<*account name*> from an impossible travel to \<*location*>, an atypical location.
    
    Next, the account \<*account name*> performed over \<*number*> administrative activities in a single session.

- **Impossible travel to atypical locations leading to mass file deletion**
    
    This alert is an indication of a sign-in event by \<*account name*> to \<*location*>, an atypical location. 
    
    Next, the account \<*account name*> deleted \<*number of*> unique files in a single session.

    This alert is an indication of a sign-in event by \<*account name*> from an impossible travel to \<*location*>, an atypical location. 
    
    Next, the account \<*account name*> performed an unusual amount (\<*number of activities*>) of impersonation activities in a single session.
