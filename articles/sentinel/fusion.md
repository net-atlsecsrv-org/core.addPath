# Advanced multistage attack detection in Azure Sentinel


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Fusion features in Azure Sentinel are currently in **public preview**.
> These features are provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

By using Fusion technology based on machine learning, Azure Sentinel can automatically detect multistage attacks by identifying combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed at various stages of the kill-chain. On the basis of these discoveries, Azure Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be difficult to catch. These incidents comprise two or more alerts or activities. By design, these incidents are low-volume, high-fidelity, and high-severity.

Customized for your environment, this detection technology not only reduces false positive rates but can also detect attacks with limited or missing information.

## Configuration for advanced multistage attack detection

This detection is enabled by default in Azure Sentinel. To check the status, or to disable it in the event that you are using an alternative solution to create incidents based on multiple alerts, use the following instructions:

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Azure Sentinel** > **Configuration** > **Analytics**

1. Select **Active rules**, and then locate **Advanced Multistage Attack Detection** in the **NAME** column by filtering the list for the **Fusion** rule type. Check the **STATUS** column to confirm whether this detection is enabled or disabled.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/fusion/selecting-fusion-rule-type.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

1. To change the status, select this entry and on the **Advanced Multistage Attack Detection** blade, select **Edit**.

1. On the **Rule creation wizard** blade, the change of status is automatically selected for you, so select **Next: Review**, and then **Save**. 

 Since the **Fusion** rule type contains only one rule that can't be modified, rule templates are not applicable for this rule type.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Sentinel currently uses 30 days of historical data to train the machine learning systems. This data is always encrypted using Microsoft’s keys as it passes through the machine learning pipeline. However, the training data is not encrypted using [Customer Managed Keys (CMK)](customer-managed-keys.md) if you enabled CMK in your Azure Sentinel workspace. To opt out of Fusion, navigate to **Azure Sentinel** \> **Configuration** \> **Analytics \> Active rules \> Advanced Multistage Attack Detection** and in the **Status** column, select **Disable.**

## Attack detection scenarios

The following section lists the types of correlation scenarios, grouped by threat classification, that Azure Sentinel looks for using Fusion technology.

As mentioned above, since Fusion correlates multiple security alerts from various products to detect advanced multistage attacks, successful Fusion detections are presented as **Fusion incidents** on the Azure Sentinel **Incidents** page, and not as **alerts** in the **Security Alerts** table in **Logs**.

In order to enable these Fusion-powered attack detection scenarios, any data sources listed must be ingested using the associated Azure Sentinel data connectors.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these scenarios are in **public preview**. They will be so indicated.

## Compute resource abuse

## Malicious execution with legitimate process

### PowerShell made a suspicious network connection, followed by anomalous traffic flagged by Palo Alto Networks firewall.
This scenario is currently in **public preview**.

**MITRE ATT&CK tactics:** Execution

**MITRE ATT&CK techniques:** Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)

**Data connector sources:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (formerly Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, or MDATP), Palo Alto Networks 

**Description:** Fusion incidents of this type indicate that an outbound connection request was made via a PowerShell command, and following that, anomalous inbound activity was detected by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall. This provides an indication that an attacker has likely gained access to your network and is trying to perform malicious actions. Connection attempts by PowerShell that follow this pattern could be an indication of malware command and control activity, requests for the download of additional malware, or an attacker establishing remote interactive access. As with all “living off the land” attacks, this activity could be a legitimate use of PowerShell. However, the PowerShell command execution followed by suspicious inbound Firewall activity increases the confidence that PowerShell is being used in a malicious manner and should be investigated further. In Palo Alto logs, Azure Sentinel focuses on [threat logs](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/view-and-manage-logs/log-types-and-severity-levels/threat-logs), and traffic is considered suspicious when threats are allowed (suspicious data, files, floods, packets, scans, spyware, URLs, viruses, vulnerabilities, wildfire-viruses, wildfires). Also reference the Palo Alto Threat Log corresponding to the [Threat/Content Type](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/threat-log-fields.html) listed in the Fusion incident description for additional alert details.

**Description:** Fusion incidents of this type indicate that non-standard uses of protocols, resembling the use of attack frameworks such as Metasploit, were detected, and following that, suspicious inbound activity was detected by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall. This may be an initial indication that an attacker has exploited a service to gain access to your network resources or that an attacker has already gained access and is trying to further exploit available systems/services to move laterally and/or escalate privileges. In Palo Alto logs, Azure Sentinel focuses on [threat logs](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/view-and-manage-logs/log-types-and-severity-levels/threat-logs), and traffic is considered suspicious when threats are allowed (suspicious data, files, floods, packets, scans, spyware, URLs, viruses, vulnerabilities, wildfire-viruses, wildfires). Also reference the Palo Alto Threat Log corresponding to the [Threat/Content Type](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/threat-log-fields.html) listed in the Fusion incident description for additional alert details.
