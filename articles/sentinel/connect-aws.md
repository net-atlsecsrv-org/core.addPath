# Connect Azure Sentinel to AWS

Use the AWS connector to stream all your AWS CloudTrail events into Azure Sentinel. This connection process delegates access for Azure Sentinel to your AWS resource logs, creating a trust relationship between AWS CloudTrail and
Azure Sentinel. This is accomplished on AWS by creating a role that gives permission to Azure Sentinel to access your AWS logs.

## Prerequisites

You must have write permission on the Azure Sentinel workspace.

## Connect AWS 
 
1.  In your Amazon Web Services console, under **Security, Identity & Compliance**, click on **IAM**.

3.  Choose **Another AWS account.** In the **Account ID** field, enter the **Microsoft Account ID** (**123412341234**) that can be found in the AWS connector page in the Azure Sentinel portal.
