# Extend Azure Sentinel across workspaces and tenants

## The need to use multiple Azure Sentinel workspaces

Azure Sentinel is built on top of a Log Analytics workspace. You'll notice that the first step in onboarding Azure Sentinel is to select the Log Analytics workspace you wish to use for that purpose.

You can get the full benefit of the Azure Sentinel experience when using a single workspace. Even so, there are some circumstances that may require you to have multiple workspaces. The following table lists some of these situations and, when possible, suggests how the requirement may be satisfied with a single workspace:

| Requirement | Description | Ways to reduce workspace count |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Sovereignty and regulatory compliance | A workspace is tied to a specific region. If data needs to be kept in different [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/) to satisfy regulatory requirements, it must be split into separate workspaces. |  |
| Data ownership | The boundaries of data ownership, for example by subsidiaries or affiliated companies, are better delineated using separate workspaces. |  |
| Multiple Azure tenants | Azure Sentinel supports data collection from Microsoft and Azure SaaS resources only within its own Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant boundary. Therefore, each Azure AD tenant requires a separate workspace. |  |
| Granular data access control | An organization may need to allow different groups, within or outside the organization, to access some of the data collected by Azure Sentinel. For example:<br><ul><li>Resource owners' access to data pertaining to their resources</li><li>Regional or subsidiary SOCs' access to data relevant to their parts of the organization</li></ul> | Use [resource RBAC](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/controlling-access-to-azure-sentinel-data-resource-rbac/ba-p/1301463) or [table level RBAC](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/table-level-rbac-in-azure-sentinel/ba-p/965043) |
| Granular retention settings | Historically, multiple workspaces were the only way to set different retention periods for different data types. This is no longer needed in many cases, thanks to the introduction of table level retention settings. | Use [table level retention settings](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/new-per-data-type-retention-is-now-available-for-azure-sentinel/ba-p/917316) or automate [data deletion](../azure-monitor/platform/personal-data-mgmt.md#how-to-export-and-delete-private-data) |
| Split billing | By placing workspaces in separate subscriptions, they can be billed to different parties. | Usage reporting and cross-charging |
| Legacy architecture | The use of multiple workspaces may stem from a historical design that took into consideration limitations or best practices which do not hold true anymore. It might also be an arbitrary design choice that can be modified to better accommodate Azure Sentinel.<br><br>Examples include:<br><ul><li>Using a per-subscription default workspace when deploying Azure Security Center</li><li>The need for granular access control or retention settings, the solutions for which are relatively new</li></ul> | Re-architect workspaces |

### Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)

A particular use case that mandates multiple workspaces is an MSSP Azure Sentinel service. In this case, many if not all of the above requirements apply, making multiple workspaces, across tenants, the best practice. The MSSP can use [Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/overview.md) to extend Azure Sentinel cross-workspace capabilities across tenants.

## Azure Sentinel multiple workspace architecture

As implied by the requirements above, there are cases where multiple Azure Sentinel workspaces, potentially across Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants, need to be centrally monitored and managed by a single SOC.

- An MSSP Azure Sentinel Service.

- A global SOC serving multiple subsidiaries, each having its own local SOC.

- A SOC monitoring multiple Azure AD tenants within an organization.

To address this requirement, Azure Sentinel offers multiple-workspace capabilities that enable central monitoring, configuration, and management, providing a single pane of glass across everything covered by the SOC, as presented in the diagram below.

This model offers significant advantages over a fully centralized model in which all data is copied to a single workspace:

- Flexible role assignment to the global and local SOCs, or to the MSSP its customers.

- Fewer challenges regarding data ownership, data privacy and regulatory compliance.

- Minimal network latency and charges.

- Easy onboarding and offboarding of new subsidiaries or customers.

In the following sections, we will explain how to operate this model, and particularly how to:

- Centrally monitor multiple workspaces, potentially across tenants, providing the SOC with a single pane of glass.

- Centrally configure and manage multiple workspaces, potentially across tenants, using automation.

## Cross-workspace monitoring

### Manage incidents on multiple workspaces

Azure Sentinel supports a [multiple workspace incident view](./multiple-workspace-view.md) facilitating central incident monitoring and management across multiple workspaces. The centralized incident view lets you manage incidents directly or drill down transparently to the incident details in the context of the originating workspace.

### Cross-workspace querying

Azure Sentinel supports querying [multiple workspaces in a single query](../azure-monitor/log-query/cross-workspace-query.md), allowing you to search and correlate data from multiple workspaces in a single query. 

- Use the [workspace() expression](../azure-monitor/log-query/workspace-expression.md) to refer to a table in a different workspace. 
- Use the [union operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/unionoperator?pivots=azuremonitor) alongside the workspace() expression to apply a query across tables in multiple workspaces.

You can use saved [functions](../azure-monitor/log-query/functions.md) to simplify cross-workspace queries. For example, if a reference to a workspace is long, you may want to save the expression `workspace("customer-A's-hard-to-remember-workspace-name").SecurityEvent` as a function called `SecurityEventCustomerA`. You can then write queries as `SecurityEventCustomerA | where ...` .

A function can also simplify a commonly used union. For example, you can save the following expression as a function called `unionSecurityEvent`:

`union workspace(“hard-to-remember-workspace-name-1”).SecurityEvent, workspace(“hard-to-remember-workspace-name-2”).SecurityEvent`

You can then write a query across both workspaces by beginning with `unionSecurityEvent | where ...` .

#### Scheduled alerts

Cross-workspace queries can now be included in scheduled alerts in analytics rules, subject to the following limitations:

- Up to 10 workspaces can be included in a single query.
- Azure Sentinel must be deployed on every workspace referenced in the query.

> [!NOTE] 
> Querying multiple workspaces in the same query might affect performance, and therefore is recommended only when the logic requires this functionality.

### Using cross-workspace workbooks

[Workbooks](./overview.md#workbooks) provide dashboards and apps to Azure Sentinel. When working with multiple workspaces, they provide monitoring and actions across workspaces.

Workbooks can provide cross-workspace queries in one of three methods, each of which cater to different levels of end-user expertise:

| Method  | Description | When should I use? |
|---------|-------------|--------------------|
| Write cross-workspace queries | The workbook creator can write cross-workspace queries (described above) in the workbook. | This option enables workbook creators to shield the user entirely from the workspace structure. |
| Add a workspace selector to the workbook | The workbook creator can implement a workspace selector as part of the workbook, as described [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/making-your-azure-sentinel-workbooks-multi-tenant-or-multi/ba-p/1402357). | This option provides the user with control over the workspaces shown by the workbook, by means of an easy-to-use dropdown box. |
| Edit the workbook interactively | An advanced user modifying an existing workbook can edit the queries in it, selecting the target workspaces using the workspace selector in the editor. | This option enables a power user to easily modify existing workbooks to work with multiple workspaces. |
|

### Cross-workspace hunting

Azure Sentinel provides preloaded query samples designed to get you started and get you familiar with the tables and the query language. These built-in hunting queries are developed by Microsoft security researchers on a continuous basis, both adding new queries and fine-tuning existing queries, to provide you with an entry point to look for new detections and identify signs of intrusion that may have gone undetected by your security tools.  

Cross-workspace hunting capabilities enable your threat hunters to create new hunting queries, or adapt existing ones, to cover multiple workspaces, by using the union operator and the workspace() expression as shown above.

## Cross-workspace management using automation

To configure and manage multiple Azure Sentinel workspaces, you will need to automate the use of the Azure Sentinel management API. For more information on how to automate the deployment of Azure Sentinel resources, including alert rules, hunting queries, workbooks and playbooks, see [Extending Azure Sentinel: APIs, Integration and management automation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/extending-azure-sentinel-apis-integration-and-management/ba-p/1116885).

See also [Deploying and Managing Azure Sentinel as Code](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/deploying-and-managing-azure-sentinel-as-code/ba-p/1131928) and [Combining Azure Lighthouse with Sentinel’s DevOps capabilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/combining-azure-lighthouse-with-sentinel-s-devops-capabilities/ba-p/1210966) for a consolidated, community-contributed methodology for managing Azure Sentinel as code and for deploying and configuring resources from a private GitHub repository. 

## Managing workspaces across tenants using Azure Lighthouse

As mentioned above, in many scenarios, the different Azure Sentinel workspaces can be located in different Azure AD tenants. You can use [Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/overview.md) to extend all cross-workspace activities across tenant boundaries, allowing users in your managing tenant to work on Azure Sentinel workspaces across all tenants. Once Azure Lighthouse is [onboarded](../lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer.md), use the [directory + subscription selector](./multiple-tenants-service-providers.md#how-to-access-azure-sentinel-in-managed-tenants) on the Azure portal to select all the subscriptions containing workspaces you want to manage, in order to ensure that they will all be available in the different workspace selectors in the portal.

When using Azure Lighthouse, it is recommended to create a group for each Azure Sentinel role and delegate permissions from each tenant to those groups.
