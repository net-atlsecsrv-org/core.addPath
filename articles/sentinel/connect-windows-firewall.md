# Connect Windows firewall

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

The Windows firewall connector allows you to easily connect your Windows firewalls logs, if they are connected to your Azure Sentinel workspace. This connection enables you to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. This gives you more insight into your organizationâ€™s network and improves your security operation capabilities.  


> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Enable the connector 

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, select **Data connectors** and then click on the **Windows firewall** tile. 
1. Select which data types you want to stream.
1. Click **Install**.
6. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Windows firewall, search for **SecurityEvent**.

## Validate connectivity

It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
