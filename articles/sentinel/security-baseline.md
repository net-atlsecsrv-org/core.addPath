# Azure security baseline for Azure Sentinel

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Sentinel. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Sentinel. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Sentinel have been excluded. To see how Azure Sentinel completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Sentinel security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Responsibility**: Shared

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

**Guidance**: You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. You can use built-in Azure roles or custom roles for individuals and groups. 

Azure Sentinel uses Azure RBAC to provide built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure. Using Azure RBAC, you can use and create roles within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to Azure Sentinel. Based on the roles, you have fine-grained control over what users with access to Azure Sentinel can see. You can assign Azure roles in the Azure Sentinel workspace directly, or to a subscription or resource group that the workspace belongs to. There are three specific built-in Azure Sentinel roles:

- Azure Sentinel reader
- Azure Sentinel responder
- Azure Sentinel contributor

In addition to Azure Sentinel dedicated Azure roles, there are Azure and Log Analytics built-in Azure roles that can grant a wider set of permissions that include access to your Azure Sentinel workspace and other resources:

Azure roles include Owner, Contributor, and Reader. Azure roles grant access across all your Azure resources, including Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Sentinel resources.

Log Analytics roles include Log Analytics contributor and Log Analytics reader. Log Analytics roles grant access across all your Log Analytics workspaces.

Additionally, each Sentinel workbook is an Azure resource, and you can assign roles to users for managing access.

## Malware defense

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Malware defense](../security/benchmarks/security-control-malware-defense.md).*

### 8.2: Pre-scan files to be uploaded to non-compute Azure resources

**Guidance**: Microsoft Antimalware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure Sentinel and Log Analytics), however it does not run on customer content. 

It is your responsibility to pre-scan any content being uploaded to non-compute Azure resources, including Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft cannot access customer data, and therefore cannot conduct anti-malware scans of customer content on your behalf.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Data recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion. In the event that a user revokes the key encryption key, either by deleting it or removing access for Azure Sentinel, within one hour, Azure Sentinel will honor the change and behave as if the data is no longer available. At this point, any operation performed that uses persistent storage resources such as data ingestion, persistent configuration changes, and incident creation, will be prevented. Previously stored data will not be deleted but will remain inaccessible. Inaccessible data is governed by the data-retention policy and will be purged in accordance with that policy.

The only operation possible after the encryption key is revoked or deleted is account deletion.

If access is restored after revocation, Azure Sentinel will restore access to the data within an hour.
