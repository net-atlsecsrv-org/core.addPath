# Import threat intelligence into Azure Sentinel

## Introduction to threat intelligence

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is information describing known existing or potential threats to systems and users. This type of information takes many forms, from written reports detailing a particular threat actor’s motivations, infrastructure, and techniques, to specific observations of IP addresses, domains, and file hashes associated with cyber threats. CTI is used by organizations to provide essential context to unusual activity, so that security personnel can quickly take action to protect their people and assets. CTI can be sourced from many places, such as open-source data feeds, threat intelligence-sharing communities, commercial intelligence feeds, and local intelligence gathered in the course of security investigations within an organization.

Within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution like Azure Sentinel, the most utilized form of CTI is threat indicators, often referred to as Indicators of Compromise or IoCs. Threat indicators are data that associate observations such as URLs, file hashes, or IP addresses with known threat activity such as phishing, botnets, or malware. This form of threat intelligence is often called tactical threat intelligence because it can be applied to security products and automation in large scale to protect and detect potential threats to an organization. In Azure Sentinel, you can use threat indicators to help detect malicious activity observed in your environment and provide context to security investigators to help inform response decisions.

You can integrate threat intelligence (TI) into Azure Sentinel through the following activities:

- Use **Data connectors** to various TI platforms to [import threat intelligence](./connect-threat-intelligence.md) into Azure Sentinel.
- View and manage the imported threat intelligence in **Logs** and in the new **Threat Intelligence** area of Azure Sentinel.
- Use the built-in **Analytics** rule templates to generate security alerts and incidents using your imported threat intelligence.
- Visualize key information about your threat intelligence in Azure Sentinel with the **Threat Intelligence workbook**.

Threat Intelligence also provides useful context within other Azure Sentinel experiences such as **Hunting** and **Notebooks**, and while not covered in this article, these experiences are addressed in [this great blog post by Ian Hellen on Jupyter Notebooks in Sentinel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/using-threat-intelligence-in-your-jupyter-notebooks/ba-p/860239), which covers the use of CTI within Notebooks.

## Azure Sentinel data connectors for threat intelligence

Just like all the other event data in Azure Sentinel, threat indicators are imported using data connectors. There are two data connectors in Azure Sentinel provided specifically for threat indicators, **Threat Intelligence - TAXII** and **Threat Intelligence Platforms**. You can use either data connector alone, or both connectors together, depending on where your organization sources threat indicators. Let’s talk about each of the data connectors.

### Adding threat indicators to Azure Sentinel with the Threat Intelligence Platforms data connector

Many organizations utilize threat intelligence platform (TIP) solutions to aggregate threat indicator feeds from a variety of sources, to curate the data within the platform, and then to choose which threat indicators to apply to various security solutions such as network devices, advanced threat protection solutions, or SIEMs such as Azure Sentinel. If your organization utilizes an integrated TIP solution, such as MISP, Anomali ThreatStream, ThreatConnect, EclecticIQ Platform, ThreatQ Threat Intelligence Platform, or Palo Alto Networks' MineMeld, the **Threat Intelligence Platforms data connector** allows you to use your TIP to import threat indicators into Azure Sentinel. Because the connector works with the [Microsoft Graph Security tiIndicators API](/graph/api/resources/tiindicator) to accomplish this, the connector can also be used by any custom threat intelligence platform to take advantage of the tiIndicators API to send indicators to Azure Sentinel (and to other Microsoft security solutions like Defender ATP).

:::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-import-path.png" alt-text="Threat intelligence import path":::

Follow these steps to import threat indicators to Azure Sentinel from your integrated TIP or custom threat intelligence solution:

1. Obtain an Application ID and Client Secret from your Azure Active Directory

1. Input this information into your TIP solution or custom application

1. Enable the Threat Intelligence Platforms data connector in Azure Sentinel

Here's a detailed look at each of these steps.

#### Obtain an Application ID and Client secret from your Azure Active Directory

Whether you are working with a TIP or with a custom solution, the tiIndicators API requires some basic information to connect and send threat indicators. The three pieces of information you will need to obtain are:
- Application (client) ID
- Directory (tenant) ID
- Client secret

This information always comes from your Azure Active Directory through a process called **App Registration** which includes the following three steps:
- Register an app with Azure Active Directory
- Specify the permissions required by the app to connect to the Microsoft Graph tiIndicators API and send threat indicators
- Obtain consent from your organization to grant these permissions to this application.  

**Register an application with Azure Active Directory**

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** service.

1. Select **App Registrations** from the menu and select **New registration**.

1. Choose a name for your application registration, select the **Single tenant** radio button and select **Register**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-register-application.png" alt-text="Register an application":::

1. From the resulting screen, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** values. These are the first two pieces of information you’ll need later to configure your TIP or custom solution to send threat indicators to Azure Sentinel.

**Specify the permissions required by the application**

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** service.

1. Select **App Registrations** from the menu and select your newly registered app.

1. Select **API Permissions** from the menu and click the **Add a permission** button.

1. On the **Select an API** page, select **Microsoft Graph** to choose from a list of Microsoft Graph permissions.

1. When asked **What type of permissions does your application require?** select **Application permissions**. This is the type of permissions used by applications authenticating with App ID and App Secrets (API Keys).

1. Select **ThreatIndicators.ReadWrite.OwnedBy** and select **Add permissions** to add this permission to your app’s list of permissions.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-api-permissions-1.png" alt-text="Specify permissions":::

**Obtain consent from your organization to grant these permissions**

1. To grant consent, you need an Azure Active Directory Global Administrator to select the **Grant admin consent for your tenant** button on your app’s API permissions page. If you do not have the Global Administrator role on your account, this button will not be available, and you will need to ask a Global Administrator from your organization to perform this step.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-api-permissions-2.png" alt-text="Grant consent":::

1. Once consent has been granted to your app, you should see a green check mark under **Status**.
 
Now that your app has been registered and permissions have been granted, you can get the last thing on your list - a client secret for your app.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** service.

1. Select **App Registrations** from the menu and select your newly registered app.

1. Select **Certificates & secrets** from the menu and click the **New client secret** button to obtain a secret (API key) for your app.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-client-secret.png" alt-text="Get client secret":::

1. Click the **Add** button and **be sure to copy the client secret**, as you cannot retrieve this secret again if you navigate away from this page. You will need this value when you configure your TIP or custom solution.

#### Input this information into your TIP solution or custom application

You now have all three pieces of information you need to configure your TIP or custom solution to send threat indicators to Azure Sentinel. 
- Application (client) ID
- Directory (tenant) ID
- Client secret

Enter these values in the configuration of your integrated TIP or custom solution where required, and threat indicators will be sent via the Microsoft Graph tiIndicators API targeted at Azure Sentinel.

#### Enable the Threat Intelligence Platforms data connector in Azure Sentinel

The last step in the integration process is to enable the **Threat Intelligence Platforms** data connector in Azure Sentinel. This is the step that imports the threat indicators sent from your TIP or custom solution via the Microsoft Graph tiIndicators API into Azure Sentinel. These indicators will be available to all Azure Sentinel workspaces for your organization. Follow these steps to enable the Threat Intelligence Platforms data connector for each workspace:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you want to import the threat indicators sent from your TIP or custom solution.

1. Select **Data connectors** from the menu, select **Threat Intelligence Platforms** from the connectors gallery, and click the **Open connector page** button.

1. As you’ve already completed the app registration and configured your TIP or custom solution to send threat indicators, the only step left is to click the **Connect** button.

Within a few minutes, threat indicators should begin flowing into this Azure Sentinel workspace.

### Adding threat indicators to Azure Sentinel with the Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector

The most widely-adopted industry standard for the transmission of threat intelligence is a [combination of the STIX data format and the TAXII protocol](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/). If your organization obtains threat indicators from solutions that support the current STIX/TAXII version (2.0 or 2.1), you can use the **Threat Intelligence - TAXII** data connector to bring your threat indicators into Azure Sentinel. The Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector enables a built-in TAXII client in Azure Sentinel to import threat intelligence from TAXII 2.x servers.

:::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-taxii-import-path.png" alt-text="TAXII import path":::
 
Follow these steps to import STIX formatted threat indicators to Azure Sentinel from a TAXII server:

1. Obtain the TAXII server API Root and Collection ID

1. Enable the Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector in Azure Sentinel

Now let’s take a detailed look at each of these steps.

#### Obtain the TAXII server API Root and Collection ID

TAXII 2.x servers advertise API Roots, which are URLs that host Collections of threat intelligence. Most often the API Root can be obtained via the documentation page of the threat intelligence provider hosting the TAXII server. However, sometimes the only information advertised is a URL known as a Discovery Endpoint. If this is the case, it is easy to find the API Root using the Discovery Endpoint. If you already know the TAXII server API Root and Collection IDs you want to work with, feel free to skip to the next section, **Enable the Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector in Azure Sentinel**.

Let’s look at an actual example of how to use a simple command line utility called [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), which is provided in Windows and most Linux distributions, to discover the API Root and browse the Collections of a TAXII server starting only from the discovery endpoint. For this example, we’ll use the discovery endpoint of the [Anomali Limo](https://www.anomali.com/community/limo) ThreatStream TAXII 2.0 server.

1.	From a browser, navigate to the [ThreatStream TAXII 2.0 server discovery endpoint](https://limo.anomali.com/taxii) to retrieve the API Root. Authenticate with the user and password `guest`.

    ```json
    {
        "api_roots":
        [
            "https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/",
            "https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/trusted_circles/",
            "https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/search_filters/"
        ],
        "contact": "info@anomali.com",
        "default": "https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/",
        "description": "TAXII 2.0 Server (guest)",
        "title": "ThreatStream Taxii 2.0 Server"
    }
    ```

2.	Use the cURL utility and the API Root (https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/) from the previous step to browse the list of Collection IDs hosted on the API Root

    ```json
    curl -u guest https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/collections/
    {
        "collections":
        [
            {

                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,
                "description": "",
                "id": "150",
                "title": "DShield Scanning IPs"
            },
            {
                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,

            {
                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,
                "description": "",
                "id": "209",
                "title": "Blutmagie TOR Nodes"
            },
            {
                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,
                "description": "",
                "id": "31",
                "title": "Emerging Threats C&C Server"
            },
            {
                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,
                "description": "",
                "id": "33",
                "title": "Lehigh Malwaredomains"
            },
            {
                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,
                "description": "",
                "id": "41",
                "title": "CyberCrime"
            },
            {
                "can_read": true,
                "can_write": false,
                "description": "",
                "id": "68",
                "title": "Emerging Threats - Compromised"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

You now have all the information you need to connect Azure Sentinel to one or more TAXII server Collections provided by Anomali Limo.

| **API Root** (https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/) | Collection ID |

#### Enable the Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector in Azure Sentinel

To import threat indicators into Azure Sentinel from a TAXII server, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you want to import threat indicators from the TAXII server.

1. Select **Data connectors** from the menu, select **Threat Intelligence - TAXII** from the connectors gallery, and click the **Open connector page** button.

1. Type a **name** for this TAXII server Collection, **API Root URL**, **Collection ID**, **Username** (if required), and **Password** (if required), and click the **Add** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-configure-taxii-servers.png" alt-text="Configure TAXII servers":::
 
You should receive confirmation that a connection to the TAXII server was established successfully, and you may repeat step (4) above as many times as desired to connect to multiple Collections from the same or different TAXII servers.

## View your threat indicators in Azure Sentinel

Now that you’ve successfully imported threat indicators into Azure Sentinel using either the **Threat Intelligence Platforms** and/or the **Threat Intelligence - TAXII** data connector, you can view them in the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table in **Logs** which is where all your Azure Sentinel event data is stored. This table is the basis for queries performed by other Azure Sentinel features such as Analytics and Workbooks. Here's how to find and view your threat indicators in the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you’ve imported threat indicators using either threat intelligence data connector.

1. Select **Logs** from the **General** section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. The **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table is located under the **Azure Sentinel** group.

1. Select the **Preview data** icon (the eye) next to the table name and select the **See in query editor** button to execute a query which will show records from this table.

Your results should look similar to the sample threat indicator shown below:

:::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-sample-query.png" alt-text="Sample query data":::
 
## Manage your threat indicators in the new Threat Intelligence area of Azure Sentinel

With the new **Threat Intelligence** area, accessible from the Azure Sentinel menu, you can also view, sort, filter, and search your imported threat indicators without even writing a **Logs** query. This new area also allows you to create threat indicators directly within the Azure Sentinel interface, as well as perform common threat intelligence administrative tasks like indicator tagging and creating new indicators related to security investigations.
Let’s look at two of the most common tasks, creating new threat indicators and tagging indicators for easy grouping and reference.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you’ve imported threat indicators using either threat intelligence data connector.

1. Select **Threat Intelligence** from the Threat Management section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. Select the **Add new** button from the top menu of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-add-new-indicator.png" alt-text="Add a new threat indicator" lightbox="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-add-new-indicator.png":::

1. Choose the indicator type, then complete the required fields marked with a red asterisk (*) on the **New indicator** panel.

1. Select **Apply**. The indicator is added to the Indicators grid, and is also sent to the ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table in **Logs**.

Tagging threat indicators is an easy way to group them together to make them easier to find. Typically, you might apply a tag to indicators related to a particular incident, or to indicators representing threats from a particular known actor or a well known attack campaign. You can tag threat indicators individually, or multi-select indicators and tag them all at once. Shown below is an example of tagging multiple indicators with an incident ID. Since tagging is free-form, a recommended practice is to create standard naming conventions for threat indicator tags. You can apply multiple tags to each indicator.

:::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-tagging-indicators.png" alt-text="Apply tags to threat indicators" lightbox="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-tagging-indicators.png":::

## Analytics puts your threat indicators to work detecting potential threats

You’ve got your threat indicators fed into Azure Sentinel; you've seen how to view and manage them; now see what they can do for you. The most important use case for threat indicators in SIEM solutions like Azure Sentinel is to power analytics rules.  These indicator-based rules compare raw events from your data sources against your threat indicators to detect security threats in your organization. In Azure Sentinel **Analytics**, you create analytics rules that run on a scheduled basis and generate security alerts. The rules are driven by queries, along with configurations that determine how often the rule should run, what kind of query results should generate security alerts, and any automated responses to trigger when alerts are generated.

While you can always create new analytics rules from scratch, Azure Sentinel provides a set of built-in rule templates, created by Microsoft security engineers, that you can use as-is or modify to meet your needs. You can readily identify the rule templates that use threat indicators, as they are all titled beginning with "**TI map**…". All these rule templates operate similarly, with the only difference being which type of threat indicators are used (domain, email, file hash, IP address, or URL) and which event type to match against. Each template lists the required data sources needed for the rule to function, so you can see at a glance if you have the necessary events already imported in Azure Sentinel.

Let’s take a look at one of these rule templates and walk through how to enable and configure the rule to generate security alerts using the threat indicators you’ve imported into Azure Sentinel. For this example, we’ll use the rule template called **TI map IP entity to AzureActivity**. This rule will match any IP address-type threat indicator with all your Azure Activity events. When a match is found, an **alert** will be generated, as well as a corresponding **incident** for investigation by your security operations team. This analytics rule will operate successfully only if you have enabled one or both of the **Threat Intelligence** data connectors (to import threat indicators) and the **Azure Activity** data connector (to import your Azure subscription-level events).

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you imported threat indicators using the **Threat Intelligence** data connectors and Azure activity data using the **Azure Activity** data connector.

1. Select **Analytics** from the **Configuration** section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. Select the **Rule templates** tab to see the list of available analytics rule templates.

1. Navigate to the rule titled **TI map IP entity to AzureActivity** and ensure you have connected all the required data sources as shown below.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-required-data-sources.png" alt-text="Required data sources":::

1. Select this rule and select the **Create rule** button. This opens a wizard to configure the rule. Complete the settings here and select the **Next: Set rule logic >** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/import-threat-intelligence/threat-intel-create-analytics-rule.png" alt-text="Create analytics rule":::

1. The rule logic portion of the wizard contains:
    - The query which will be used in the rule.

    - Entity mappings, which tell Azure Sentinel how to recognize entities like Accounts, IP addresses, and URLs, so that **incidents** and **investigations** understand how to work with the data in any security alerts generated by this rule.

    - The schedule to run this rule.

    - The number of query results needed before a security alert is generated.

    The default settings in the template are:
    - Run once an hour.

    - Match any IP address threat indicators from the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table with any IP address found in the last one hour of events from the **AzureActivity** table.

    - Generate a security alert if the query results are greater than zero, meaning if any matches are found.

You can leave the default settings or change any of these to meet your requirements. When you are finished, select the **Next: Automated response >** button

1. This step of the wizard allows you to configure any automation you’d like to trigger when a security alert is generated from this analytics rule. Automation in Azure Sentinel is done using **Playbooks**, powered by Azure Logic Apps. To learn more, see this [Tutorial: Set up automated threat responses in Azure Sentinel](./tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md). For this example, we will just select the **Next: Review >** button to continue.

1. This last step validates the settings in your rule. When you are ready to enable the rule, select the **Create** button and you are finished.

Now that you have enabled your analytics rule, you can find your enabled rule in the **Active rules** tab of the **Analytics** section of Azure Sentinel. You can edit, enable, disable, duplicate or delete the active rule from there. The new rule runs immediately upon activation, and from then on will run on its defined schedule.

According to the default settings, each time the rule runs on its schedule, any results found will generate a security alert. Security alerts in Azure Sentinel can be viewed in the **Logs** section of Azure Sentinel, in the **SecurityAlert** table under the **Azure Sentinel** group.

In Azure Sentinel, the alerts generated from analytics rules also generate security incidents which can be found in **Incidents** under **Threat Management** on the Azure Sentinel menu. Incidents are what your security operations teams will triage and investigate to determine the appropriate response actions. You can find detailed information in this [Tutorial: Investigate incidents with Azure Sentinel](./tutorial-investigate-cases.md).

## Workbooks provide insights about your threat intelligence

Finally, you can use an Azure Sentinel Workbook to visualize key information about your threat intelligence in Azure Sentinel, and you can easily customize the workbooks according to your business needs.
Let’s walk through how to find the threat intelligence workbook provided in Azure Sentinel, and we will also show how to make edits to the workbook to customize it.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you’ve imported threat indicators using either threat intelligence data connector.

Workbooks provide powerful interactive dashboards that give you insights into all aspects of Azure Sentinel. There is a whole lot you can do with workbooks, and while the provided templates are a great starting point, you will likely want to dive in and customize these templates, or create new dashboards combining many different data sources so you can visualize your data in unique ways. Since Azure Sentinel workbooks are based on Azure Monitor workbooks, there is already extensive documentation available, and many more templates. A great place to start is this article on how to [Create interactive reports with Azure Monitor workbooks](../azure-monitor/platform/workbooks-overview.md). 

There is also a rich community of [Azure Monitor workbooks on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Application-Insights-Workbooks) where you can download additional templates and contribute your own templates.
