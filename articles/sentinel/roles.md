# Permissions in Azure Sentinel

Azure Sentinel uses [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)
to provide [built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure.

Use Azure RBAC to create and assign roles within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to Azure Sentinel. The different roles give you fine-grained control over what users of Azure Sentinel can see and do. Azure roles can be assigned in the Azure Sentinel workspace directly (see note below), or in a subscription or resource group that the workspace belongs to, which Azure Sentinel will inherit.

## Roles for working in Azure Sentinel

### Azure Sentinel-specific roles

There are three dedicated built-in Azure Sentinel roles.

**All Azure Sentinel built-in roles grant read access to the data in your Azure Sentinel workspace.**

- [Azure Sentinel Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-sentinel-reader) can view data, incidents, workbooks, and other Azure Sentinel resources.

- [Azure Sentinel Responder](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-sentinel-responder) can, in addition to the above, manage incidents (assign, dismiss, etc.)

- [Azure Sentinel Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-sentinel-contributor) can, in addition to the above, create and edit workbooks, analytics rules, and other Azure Sentinel resources.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For best results, these roles should be assigned on the **resource group** that contains the Azure Sentinel workspace. This way, the roles will apply to all the resources that are deployed to support Azure Sentinel, as those resources should also be placed in that same resource group.
>
> - Another option is to assign the roles directly on the Azure Sentinel **workspace** itself. If you do this, you must also assign the same roles on the SecurityInsights **solution resource** in that workspace. You may need to assign them on other resources as well, and you will need to be constantly managing role assignments on resources.

### Additional roles and permissions

Users with particular job requirements may need to be assigned additional roles or specific permissions in order to accomplish their tasks.

- Working with playbooks to automate responses to threats

    Azure Sentinel uses **playbooks** for automated threat response. Playbooks are built on **Azure Logic Apps**, and are a separate Azure resource. You might want to assign to specific members of your security operations team the ability to use Logic Apps for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) operations. You can use the [Logic App Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#logic-app-contributor) role or the [Logic App Operator](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#logic-app-operator) role to assign explicit permission for using playbooks.

- Connecting data sources to Azure Sentinel

    For a user to add **data connectors**, you must assign the user write permissions on the Azure Sentinel workspace. Also, note the required additional permissions for each connector, as listed on the relevant connector page.

- Guest users assigning incidents

    If a guest user needs to be able to assign incidents, then in addition to the Azure Sentinel Responder role, the user will also need to be assigned the role of [Directory Reader](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md#directory-readers). Note that this role is *not* an Azure role but an **Azure Active Directory** role, and that regular (non-guest) users have this role assigned by default. 

For a side-by-side comparison, see the [table below](#roles-and-allowed-actions).

### Other roles you might see assigned

In assigning Azure Sentinel-specific Azure roles, you may come across other Azure and Log Analytics Azure roles that may have been assigned to users for other purposes. You should be aware that these roles grant a wider set of permissions that includes access to your Azure Sentinel workspace and other resources:

- **Azure roles:** [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner), [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), and [Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#reader). Azure roles grant access across all your Azure resources, including Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Sentinel resources.

- **Log Analytics roles:** [Log Analytics Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#log-analytics-contributor) and [Log Analytics Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#log-analytics-reader). Log Analytics roles grant access to your Log Analytics workspaces. 

For example, a user who is assigned the **Azure Sentinel Reader** role, but not the **Azure Sentinel Contributor** role, will still be able to edit items in Azure Sentinel if assigned the Azure-level **Contributor** role. Therefore, if you want to grant permissions to a user only in Azure Sentinel, you should carefully remove this user’s prior permissions, making sure you do not break any needed access to another resource.

## Roles and allowed actions

The following table summarizes the roles and allowed actions in Azure Sentinel. 

| Role | Create and run playbooks| Create and edit workbooks, analytic rules, and other Azure Sentinel resources | Manage incidents (dismiss, assign, etc.) | View data, incidents, workbooks, and other Azure Sentinel resources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Azure Sentinel Reader | -- | -- | -- | &#10003; |
| Azure Sentinel Responder | -- | -- | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| Azure Sentinel Contributor | -- | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| Azure Sentinel Contributor + Logic App Contributor | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |

## Custom roles and advanced Azure RBAC

- In addition to, or instead of, using Azure built-in roles, you can create Azure custom roles for Azure Sentinel. Azure custom roles for Azure Sentinel are created the same way you create other [Azure custom roles](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles-rest.md#create-a-custom-role), based on [specific permissions to Azure Sentinel](../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md#microsoftsecurityinsights) and to [Azure Log Analytics resources](../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md#microsoftoperationalinsights).

- You can use the Log Analytics advanced Azure role-based access control across the data in your Azure Sentinel workspace. This includes both data type-based Azure RBAC and resource-centric Azure RBAC. For more information on Log Analytics roles, see [Manage log data and workspaces in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/manage-access.md#manage-access-using-workspace-permissions).
