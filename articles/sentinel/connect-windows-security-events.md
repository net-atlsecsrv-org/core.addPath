# Connect Windows security events 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can stream all security events from the Windows Servers connected to your Azure Sentinel workspace. This connection enables you to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. This gives you more insight into your organizationâ€™s network and improves your security operation capabilities.  You can select which events to stream:

- **All events** - All Windows security and AppLocker events.
- **Common** - A standard set of events for auditing purposes.
- **Minimal** - A small set of events that might indicate potential threats. By enabling this option, you won't be able to have a full audit trail.
- **None** - No security or AppLocker events.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Set up the Windows security events connector

To fully integrate your Windows security events with Azure Sentinel:

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, select **Data connectors** and then click on the **Windows security events** tile. 
1. Select which data types you want to stream.
1. Click **Update**.
6. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Windows security events, search for **SecurityEvent**.

## Validate connectivity

It may take around 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
