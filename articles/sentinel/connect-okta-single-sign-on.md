# Connect your Okta Single Sign-On to Azure Sentinel with Azure Function

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Okta Single Sign-On data connector in Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

The Okta Single Sign-On (SSO) connector allows you to easily connect all your [Okta Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/) security solution logs with Azure Sentinel, to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. Integration between Okta Single Sign-On and Azure Sentinel makes use of Azure Functions to pull log data using REST API.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Configure and connect Okta Single Sign-On

Azure Functions can integrate and pull events and logs directly from Okta Single Sign-On and forward them to Azure Sentinel.

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select **Okta Single Sign-On** connector.

1. Select **Open connector page**.

1. Follow the instructions on the **Okta Single Sign-On** page.

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in Log Analytics under the **Okta_CL** table.

## Validate connectivity

It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
