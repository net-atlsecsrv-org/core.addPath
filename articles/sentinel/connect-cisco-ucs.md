# Connect your Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Cisco UCS connector is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article explains how to connect your Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) appliance to Azure Sentinel. The Cisco UCS data connector allows you to easily connect your UCS logs with Azure Sentinel, so that you can view the data in workbooks, use it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve investigation. Integration between Cisco UCS and Azure Sentinel makes use of Syslog.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Prerequisites

- You must have read and write permission on the Azure Sentinel workspace.

- Your Cisco UCS solution must be configured to export logs via Syslog.

## Forward Cisco UCS logs to the Syslog agent  

Configure Cisco UCS to forward Syslog messages to your Azure Sentinel workspace via the Syslog agent.

1. In the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select **Data connectors**.

1. From the **Data connectors** gallery, select the **Cisco UCS (Preview)** connector, and then **Open connector page**.

1. Follow the instructions on the **Cisco UCS** connector page:

    1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux

        - Choose an Azure Linux VM or a non-Azure Linux machine (physical or virtual).

    1. Configure the logs to be collected

        - Select the facilities and severities in the workspace agents configuration.

    1. Configure and connect the Cisco UCS

        - Follow [these instructions](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/servers-unified-computing/ucs-manager/110265-setup-syslog-for-ucs.html#configsremotesyslog) to configure the Cisco UCS to forward syslog. For the remote server, use the IP address of the Linux machine you installed the Linux agent on.

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in Log Analytics under Syslog.

See the **Next steps** tab in the connector page for some useful sample queries.

## Validate connectivity

It may take up to 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
