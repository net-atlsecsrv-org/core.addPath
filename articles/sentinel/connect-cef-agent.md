# Step 1: Deploy the agent


In this step, you need to select the Linux machine that will act as a proxy between Azure Sentinel and your security solution. You will have to run a script on the proxy machine that:
- Installs the Log Analytics agent and configures it as needed to listen for Syslog messages.
- Configures the Syslog daemon to listen to Syslog messages using TCP port 514 and then forwards only the CEF messages to the Log Analytics agent using TCP port 25226.
- Sets the Syslog agent to collect the data and send it securely to Azure Sentinel, where it is parsed and enriched.
 
## Deploy the agent
 
1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select **Common Event Format (CEF)** and then **Open connector page**. 

1. Under **Install and configure the Syslog agent**, select your machine type, either Azure, other cloud, or on-premises. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > Because the script in the next step installs the Log Analytics agent and connects the machine to your Azure Sentinel workspace, make sure this machine is not connected to any other workspace.
1. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine. Make sure that you have Python on your machine using the following command: `python â€“version`

1. Run the following script on your proxy machine.
   `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_installer.py&&sudo python cef_installer.py [WorkspaceID] [Workspace Primary Key]`
1. While the script is running, check to make sure you don't get any error or warning messages.

Continue to [STEP 2: Configure your security solution to forward CEF messages](connect-cef-solution-config.md) .
