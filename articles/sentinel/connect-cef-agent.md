# Step 1: Deploy the log forwarder


In this step, you will designate and configure the Linux machine that will forward the logs from your security solution to your Azure Sentinel workspace. This machine can be a physical or virtual machine in your on-premises environment, an Azure VM, or a VM in another cloud. Using the link provided, you will run a script on the designated machine that performs the following tasks:
- Installs the Log Analytics agent for Linux (also known as the OMS agent) and configures it for the following purposes:
    - listening for CEF messages from the built-in Linux Syslog daemon on TCP port 25226
    - sending the messages securely over TLS to your Azure Sentinel workspace, where they are parsed and enriched

- Configures the built-in Linux Syslog daemon (rsyslog.d/syslog-ng) for the following purposes:
    - listening for Syslog messages from your security solutions on TCP port 514
    - forwarding only the messages it identifies as CEF to the Log Analytics agent on localhost using TCP port 25226
 
## Prerequisites

- You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your designated Linux machine.
- You must have python installed on the Linux machine.<br>Use the `python -version` command to check.
- The Linux machine must not be connected to any Azure workspaces before you install the Log Analytics agent.

## Run the deployment script
 
1. From the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, click **Data connectors**. From the list of connectors, click the **Common Event Format (CEF)** tile, and then the **Open connector page** button on the lower right. 

1. Under **1.2 Install the CEF collector on the Linux machine**, copy the link provided under **Run the following script to install and apply the CEF collector**, or from the text below:

     `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_installer.py&&sudo python cef_installer.py [WorkspaceID] [Workspace Primary Key]`

1. While the script is running, check to make sure you don't get any error or warning messages.

> [!NOTE]
> **Using the same machine to forward both plain Syslog *and* CEF messages**
>
> If you plan to use this log forwarder machine to forward [Syslog messages](connect-syslog.md) as well as CEF, then in order to avoid the duplication of events to the Syslog and CommonSecurityLog tables:
>
> 1. On each source machine that sends logs to the forwarder in CEF format, you must edit the Syslog configuration file to remove the facilities that are being used to send CEF messages. This way, the facilities that are sent in CEF won't also be sent in Syslog. See [Configure Syslog on Linux agent](../azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-syslog.md#configure-syslog-on-linux-agent) for detailed instructions on how to do this.
>
> 1. You must run the following command on those machines to disable the synchronization of the agent with the Syslog configuration in Azure Sentinel. This ensures that the configuration change you made in the previous step does not get overwritten.<br>
> `sudo su omsagent -c 'python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/Scripts/OMS_MetaConfigHelper.py --disable'`

Continue to [STEP 2: Configure your security solution to forward CEF messages](connect-cef-solution-config.md) .

## Deployment script explained

The following is a command-by-command description of the actions of the deployment script.

Choose a syslog daemon to see the appropriate description.

# [rsyslog daemon](#tab/rsyslog)

1. **Downloading and installing the Log Analytics agent:**

    - Downloads the installation script for the Log Analytics (OMS) Linux agent<br>
        `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh`

    - Installs the Log Analytics agent<br>
        `sh onboard_agent.sh -w [workspaceID] -s [Primary Key] -d opinsights.azure.com`

1. **Configuring the Syslog daemon:**

    1. Opens port 514 for TCP communication using the syslog configuration file `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.

    1. Configures the daemon to forward CEF messages to the Log Analytics agent on TCP port 25226, by inserting a special configuration file `security-config-omsagent.conf` into the syslog daemon directory `/etc/rsyslog.d/`.

        Contents of the `security-config-omsagent.conf` file:

        ```console
        :rawmsg, regex, "CEF"|"ASA"
        *.* @@127.0.0.1:25226
        ```

1. **Restarting the Syslog daemon**

    `service rsyslog restart`

1. **Setting the Log Analytics agent configuration to listen on port 25226 and forward CEF messages to Azure Sentinel**

    1. Downloads the configuration from the Log Analytics agent GitHub repository<br>
        `wget -o /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/[workspaceID]/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf`


    1. Restarts the Log Analytics agent<br>
        `/opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart [workspaceID]`

# [syslog-ng daemon](#tab/syslogng)

1. **Downloading and installing the Log Analytics agent:**

    - Downloads the installation script for the Log Analytics (OMS) Linux agent<br>`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh`

    - Installs the Log Analytics agent<br>`sh onboard_agent.sh -w [workspaceID] -s [Primary Key] -d opinsights.azure.com`

1. **Configuring the Syslog daemon:**

    1. Opens port 514 for TCP communication using the syslog configuration file `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf`.

    1. Configures the daemon to forward CEF messages to the Log Analytics agent on TCP port 25226, by inserting a special configuration file `security-config-omsagent.conf` into the syslog daemon directory `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/`.

        Contents of the `security-config-omsagent.conf` file:

        ```console
        filter f_oms_filter {match(\"CEF\|ASA\" ) ;};
        destination oms_destination {tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port("25226"));};
        log {source(s_src);filter(f_oms_filter);destination(oms_destination);};
        ```

1. **Restarting the Syslog daemon**

    `service syslog-ng restart`

    1. Downloads the configuration from the Log Analytics agent GitHub repository<br>
        `wget -o /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/[workspaceID]/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf`
