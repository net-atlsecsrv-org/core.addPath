# Azure Sentinel entity types reference

## Entity types and identifiers

The following table shows the **entity types** currently available for mapping in Azure Sentinel, and the **attributes** available as **identifiers** for each entity type - which appear in the **Identifiers** drop-down list in the [entity mapping](map-data-fields-to-entities.md) section of the [analytics rule wizard](tutorial-detect-threats-custom.md).

Each one of the identifiers in the **required identifiers** column is minimally necessary to identify its entity. However, a required identifier might not, by itself, be sufficient to provide *unique* identification. The more identifiers used, the greater the likelihood of unique identification. You can use up to three identifiers for a single entity mapping.

For best results - for guaranteed unique identification - you should use identifiers from the **strongest identifiers** column whenever possible. The use of multiple strong identifiers enables correlation between strong identifiers from varying data sources and schemas. This in turn allows Azure Sentinel to provide more comprehensive insights for a given entity.

## Entity type schemas

The following is a more in-depth look at the full schemas of each entity type. You'll notice that many of these schemas include links to other entity types - for example, the User account schema includes a link to the Host entity type, as one attribute of a user account is the host it's defined on. These externally-linked entities can't be used as identifiers for entity mapping, but they are very useful in giving a complete picture of entities on entity pages and the investigation graph.

> [!NOTE]
> A question mark following the value in the **Type** column indicates the field is nullable.
