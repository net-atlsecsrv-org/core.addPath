# Connect your external solution using Common Event Format

You can connect Azure Sentinel with an external solution that enables you to save log files in Syslog. If your appliance enables you to save logs as Syslog Common Event Format (CEF), the integration with Azure Sentinel enables you to easily run analytics and queries across the data.

> [!NOTE] 
> Data is stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## How it works

The connection between Azure Sentinel and your CEF appliance takes place in three steps:

1. On the appliance, you need to set these values so that the appliance sends the necessary logs in the necessary format to the Azure Sentinel Syslog agent, based on the Microsoft Monitoring Agent. You can modify these parameters in your appliance, as long as you also modify them in the Syslog daemon on the Azure Sentinel agent.
    - Protocol = UDP
    - Port = 514
    - Facility = Local4
    - Format = CEF
2. The Syslog agent collects the data and sends it securely to Log Analytics, where it is parsed and enriched.
3. The agent stores the data in a Log Analytics workspace so it can be queried as needed, using analytics, correlation rules, and dashboards.

> [!NOTE]
> The agent can collect logs from multiple sources, but must be installed on dedicated machine.

Alternatively, you can deploy the agent manually on an existing Azure VM, on a VM in another cloud, or on an on-premises machine.

## Security considerations

Make sure to configure the machine's security according to your organization's security policy. For example, you can configure your network to align with your corporate network security policy and change the ports and protocols in the daemon to align with your requirements. You can use the following instructions to improve your machine security configuration:  [Secure VM in Azure](../virtual-machines/linux/security-policy.md), [Best practices for Network security](../security/fundamentals/network-best-practices.md).

To use TLS communication between the security solution and the Syslog machine, you will need to configure the Syslog daemon (rsyslog or syslog-ng) to communicate in TLS: [Encrypting Syslog Traffic with TLS -rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/tls_cert_summary.html), [Encrypting log messages with TLS –syslog-ng](https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.22/administration-guide/60#TOPIC-1209298).


## Step 1: Configure your Syslog VM

You need to deploy an agent on a dedicated Linux machine (VM or on premises) to support the communication between the appliance and Azure Sentinel. 

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to configure the machine's security according to your organization's security policy. For example, you can configure your network to align with your corporate network security policy and change the ports and protocols in the daemon to align with your requirements. 


1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select **Common Event Format (CEF)** and then **Open connector page**. 

1. Under **Download and install the Syslog agent**, select your machine type, either Azure or on-premises. 
1. In the **Virtual machines** screen that opens, select the machine you want to use and click **Connect**.
1. If you choose **Download and install agent for Azure Linux virtual machines**, select the machine and click **Connect**. If you chose **Download and install agent for non-Azure Linux virtual machines**, in the **Direct Agent** screen, run the script under **Download and onboard agent for Linux**.
1. In the CEF connector screen, under **Configure and forward Syslog**, set whether your Syslog daemon is **rsyslog.d** or **syslog-ng**. 
1. Copy these commands and run them on your appliance:
    - If you selected rsyslog.d:
              
       1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug  @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            
       2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
            
       1. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service rsyslog restart`<br> For more information, see the [rsyslog documentation](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/tls_cert_summary.html)
           
    - If you selected syslog-ng:
       1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
       2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.

        3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service syslog-ng restart` <br>For more information, see the [syslog-ng documentation](https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.16/mutual-authentication-using-tls/2)
1. Restart the Syslog agent using this command: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart [{workspace GUID}]`
1. Confirm that there are no errors in the agent log by running this command: `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`

To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the CEF events, search for `CommonSecurityLog`.

## Step 2: Forward Common Event Format (CEF) logs to Syslog agent

Set your security solution to send Syslog messages in CEF format to your Syslog agent.​ Make sure you use the same parameters that appear in your agent configuration.​ These are usually:​

- Port 514
- Facility local4

## Step 3: Validate connectivity

It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics. 

1. Make sure you use the right facility. The facility must be the same in your appliance and in Azure Sentinel. You can check which facility file you're using in Azure Sentinel and modify it in the file `security-config-omsagent.conf`. 

2. Make sure that your logs are getting to the right port in the Syslog agent. Run this command on the Syslog agent machine: `tcpdump -A -ni any  port 514 -vv` This command shows you the logs that streams from the device to the Syslog machine. Make sure that logs are being received from the source appliance on the right port and right facility.

3. Make sure that the logs you send comply with [RFC 3164](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164).

4. On the computer running the Syslog agent, make sure these ports 514, 25226 are open and listening, using the command `netstat -a -n:`. For more information about using this command, see [netstat(8) - Linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/netstat). If it’s listening properly, you’ll see this:

   ![Azure Sentinel ports](./media/connect-cef/ports.png) 

5. Make sure the daemon is set to listen on port 514, on which you’re sending the logs.
    - For rsyslog:<br>Make sure that the file `/etc/rsyslog.conf` includes this configuration:

           # provides UDP syslog reception
           module(load="imudp")
           input(type="imudp" port="514")
        
           # provides TCP syslog reception
           module(load="imtcp")
           input(type="imtcp" port="514")

      For more information, see [imudp: UDP Syslog Input Module](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imudp.html#imudp-udp-syslog-input-module) and [imtcp: TCP Syslog Input Module](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imtcp.html#imtcp-tcp-syslog-input-module)

   - For syslog-ng:<br>Make sure that the file `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf` includes this configuration:

           # source s_network {
            network( transport(UDP) port(514));
             };
     For more information, see [syslog-ng Open Source Edition 3.16 - Administration Guide](https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.16/administration-guide/19#TOPIC-956455).

1. Check that there is communication between the Syslog daemon and the agent. Run this command on the Syslog agent machine: `tcpdump -A -ni any  port 25226 -vv` This command shows you the logs that streams from the device to the Syslog machine. Make sure that the logs are also being received on the agent.

6. If both of those commands provided successful results, check Log Analytics to see if your logs are arriving. All events streamed from these appliances appear in raw form in Log Analytics under `CommonSecurityLog` type.

7. To check if there are errors or if the logs aren't arriving, look in `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/log/omsagent.log`. If it says there are log format mismatch errors, go to `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` and look at the file `security_events.conf`and make sure that your logs match the regex format you see in this file.

8. Make sure that your Syslog message default size is limited to 2048 bytes (2 KB). If logs are too long, update the security_events.conf using this command: `message_length_limit 4096`
