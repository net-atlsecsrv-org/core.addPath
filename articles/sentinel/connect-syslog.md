# Collect data from Linux-based sources using Syslog

You can stream events from Linux-based, Syslog-supporting machines or appliances into Azure Sentinel, using the Log Analytics agent for Linux (formerly known as the OMS agent). You can do this for any machine that allows for you to install the Log Analytics agent directly on the machine. The machine's native Syslog daemon will collect local events of the specified types, and forward them locally to the agent, which will stream them to your Log Analytics workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> - If your appliance supports **Common Event Format (CEF) over Syslog**, a more complete data set is collected, and the data is parsed at collection. You should choose this option and follow the instructions in [Connect your external solution using CEF](connect-common-event-format.md).
>
> - Log Analytics supports collection of messages sent by the **rsyslog** or **syslog-ng** daemons, where rsyslog is the default. The default syslog daemon on version 5 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Oracle Linux version (**sysklog**) is not supported for syslog event collection. To collect syslog data from this version of these distributions, the rsyslog daemon should be installed and configured to replace sysklog.

## How it works

**Syslog** is an event logging protocol that is common to Linux. When the **Log Analytics agent for Linux** is installed on your VM or appliance, the installation routine configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent on TCP port 25224. The agent then sends the message to your Log Analytics workspace over HTTPS, where it is parsed into an event log entry in the Syslog table in **Azure Sentinel > Logs**.

For more information, see [Syslog data sources in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-syslog.md).

## Configure Syslog collection

### Configure your Linux machine or appliance

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then select the **Syslog** connector.

1. On the **Syslog** blade, select **Open connector page**.

1. Install the Linux agent. Under **Choose where to install the agent:**
    
    **For an Azure Linux VM:**
      
    1. Select **Install agent on Azure Linux virtual machine**.
    
    1. Click the **Download & install agent for Azure Linux Virtual machines >** link. 
    
    1. In the **Virtual machines** blade, click a virtual machine to install the agent on, and then click **Connect**. Repeat this step for each VM you wish to connect.
    
    **For any other Linux machine:**

    1. Select **Install agent on a non-Azure Linux Machine**

    1. Click the **Download & install agent for non-Azure Linux machines >** link. 

    1. In the **Agents management** blade, click the **Linux servers** tab, then copy the command for **Download and onboard agent for Linux** and run it on your Linux machine. 
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure you configure security settings for these computers according to your organization's security policy. For example, you can configure the network settings to align with your organization's network security policy, and change the ports and protocols in the daemon to align with the security requirements.

### Configure the Log Analytics agent

1. At the bottom of the Syslog connector blade, click the **Open your workspace advanced settings configuration >** link.

1. On the **Advanced settings** blade, select **Data** > **Syslog**. Then add the facilities for the connector to collect.
    
    - Add the facilities that your syslog appliance includes in its log headers. 
    
    - If you want to use anomalous SSH login detection with the data that you collect, add **auth** and **authpriv**. See the [following section](#configure-the-syslog-connector-for-anomalous-ssh-login-detection) for additional details.

1. When you have added all the facilities that you want to monitor, and adjusted any severity options for each one, select the checkbox **Apply below configuration to my machines**.

1. Select **Save**. 

1. On your VM or appliance, make sure you're sending the facilities that you specified.

1. To query the syslog log data in **Logs**, type `Syslog` in the query window.

1. You can use the query parameters described in [Using functions in Azure Monitor log queries](../azure-monitor/log-query/functions.md) to parse your Syslog messages. You can then save the query as a new Log Analytics function and use it as a new data type.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your existing [CEF log forwarder machine](connect-cef-agent.md) to collect and forward logs from plain Syslog sources as well. However, you must perform the following steps to avoid sending events in both formats to Azure Sentinel, as that will result in duplication of events.
>
>    Having already set up [data collection from your CEF sources](connect-common-event-format.md), and having configured the Log Analytics agent as above:
>
> 1. On each machine that sends logs in CEF format, you must edit the Syslog configuration file to remove the facilities that are being used to send CEF messages. This way, the facilities that are sent in CEF won't also be sent in Syslog. See [Configure Syslog on Linux agent](../azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-syslog.md#configure-syslog-on-linux-agent) for detailed instructions on how to do this.
>
> 1. You must run the following command on those machines to disable the synchronization of the agent with the Syslog configuration in Azure Sentinel. This ensures that the configuration change you made in the previous step does not get overwritten.<br>
> `sudo su omsagent -c 'python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/Scripts/OMS_MetaConfigHelper.py --disable'`


### Configure the Syslog connector for anomalous SSH login detection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Anomalous SSH login detection is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Sentinel can apply machine learning (ML) to the syslog data to identify anomalous Secure Shell (SSH) login activity. Scenarios include:

- Impossible travel – when two successful login events occur from two locations that are impossible to reach within the timeframe of the two login events.
- Unexpected location – the location from where a successful login event occurred is suspicious. For example, the location has not been seen recently.
 
This detection requires a specific configuration of the Syslog data connector: 

1. For step 5 in the previous procedure, make sure that both **auth** and **authpriv** are selected as facilities to monitor. Keep the default settings for the severity options, so that they are all selected. For example:
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Facilities required for anomalous SSH login detection](./media/connect-syslog/facilities-ssh-detection.png)

2. Allow sufficient time for syslog information to be collected. Then, navigate to **Azure Sentinel - Logs**, and copy and paste the following query:
    
    ```console
    Syslog |  where Facility in ("authpriv","auth")| extend c = extract( "Accepted\\s(publickey|password|keyboard-interactive/pam)\\sfor ([^\\s]+)",1,SyslogMessage)| where isnotempty(c) | count 
    ```
    
    Change the **Time range** if required, and select **Run**.
    
    If the resulting count is zero, confirm the configuration of the connector and that the monitored computers do have successful login activity for the time period you specified for your query.
    
    If the resulting count is greater than zero, your syslog data is suitable for anomalous SSH login detection. You enable this detection from **Analytics** >  **Rule templates** > **(Preview) Anomalous SSH Login Detection**.
