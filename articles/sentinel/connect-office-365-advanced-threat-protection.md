# Connect alerts from Microsoft Defender for Office 365 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** was formerly known as **Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)**.
>
>     You may see the old name still in use in the product (including its data connector in Azure Sentinel) for a period of time.
>
> - Ingestion of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 alerts is currently in public preview. This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
 
[Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description) safeguards your organization against zero-day and other advanced threats posed by unknown malware in email messages, malicious URL links, and collaboration tools. By ingesting Microsoft Defender for Office 365 alerts into Azure Sentinel, you'll be able to utilize information about email-, file sharing-, and URL-based threats in your security operations. You can then more comprehensively analyze security events across your organization and build playbooks for effective and immediate response.

The connector imports the following alerts:

- A potentially malicious URL click was detected 

- Email messages containing malware removed after delivery

- Email messages containing phish URLs removed after delivery 

- Email reported by user as malware or phish 

- Suspicious email sending patterns detected 

- User restricted from sending email 

These alerts can be seen by Office customers in the **Office Security and Compliance Center**.

## Prerequisites

- You must have read and write permissions on the Azure Sentinel workspace when you enable the connector.

- You must be a Global Administrator or a Security Administrator on the Azure Sentinel workspace's tenant.

- You must have a valid license for [Office 365 ATP Plan 2](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp#office-365-atp-plan-1-and-plan-2) (included with the Office 365 E5, Office 365 A5, and Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, and available for purchase separately).
