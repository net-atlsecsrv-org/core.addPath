# Connect your domain name server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can connect any Domain Name Server (DNS) running on Windows to Azure Sentinel. This is done by installing an agent on the DNS machine. Using DNS logs, you can gain security, performance, and operations-related insights into the DNS infrastructure of your organization by collecting, analyzing, and correlating analytic and audit logs and other related data from the DNS servers.

When you enable DNS log connection you can:
- Identify clients that try to resolve malicious domain names
- Identify stale resource records
- Identify frequently queried domain names and talkative DNS clients
- View request load on DNS servers
- View dynamic DNS registration failures

## How it works

DNS connection is accomplished by installing an agent on the DNS machine. The agent pulls events from the DNS and passes them to Log Analytics.

## Connect your DNS appliance

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, select **Data connectors** and choose the **DNS** tile.
1. If your DNS machines are in Azure:
    1. Click **Download & install agent for Windows virtual machines**.
    1. In the **Virtual machines** list, select the DNS machine you want to stream into Azure Sentinel. Make sure this is a Windows VM.
    1. In the window that opens for that VM, click **Connect**.  
    1. Click **Enable** in the **DNS connector** window. 

2. If your DNS machine is not an Azure VM:
    1. Click **Download & install agent for Windows non-Azure machines**.
    1. In the **Direct agent** window, select either **Download Windows agent (64 bit)** or **Download Windows agent (32 bit)**.
    1. Install the agent on your DNS machine. Copy the **Workspace ID**, **Primary key**, and **Secondary key** and use them when prompted during the installation.

3. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the DNS logs, search for **DnsEvents**.

## Validate 

In Log Analytics, search for the schema **DnsEvents** and make sure there are events.
