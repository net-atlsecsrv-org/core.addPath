# STEP 3: Validate connectivity

Once you have deployed your log forwarder (in Step 1) and configured your security solution to send it CEF messages (in Step 2), follow these instructions to verify connectivity between your security solution and Azure Sentinel. 

## Prerequisites

- You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your log forwarder machine.

- You must have Python installed on your log forwarder machine.<br>
Use the `python â€“version` command to check.

## How to validate connectivity

1. From the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, open **Logs**. Run a query using the **CommonSecurityLog** schema to see if you are receiving logs from your security solution.<br>
Be aware that it may take about 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in **Log Analytics**. 

1. If you don't see any results from the query, verify that events are being generated from your security solution, or try generating some, and verify they are being forwarded to the Syslog forwarder machine you designated. 

1. Run the following script on the log forwarder to check connectivity between your security solution, the log forwarder, and Azure Sentinel. This script checks that the daemon is listening on the correct ports, that the forwarding is properly configured, and that nothing is blocking communication between the daemon and the Log Analytics agent. It also sends mock messages 'TestCommonEventFormat' to check end-to-end connectivity. <br>
 `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_troubleshoot.py&&sudo python cef_troubleshoot.py [WorkspaceID]`

## Validation script explained

The validation script performs the following checks:

# [rsyslog daemon](#tab/rsyslog)

1. Checks that the file<br>
    `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/[WorkspaceID]/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf`<br>
    exists and is valid.

1. Checks that the file includes the following text:

    ```console
    <source>
        type syslog
        port 25226
        bind 127.0.0.1
        protocol_type tcp
        tag oms.security
        format /(?<time>(?:\w+ +){2,3}(?:\d+:){2}\d+|\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.[\w\-\:\+]{3,12}):?\s*(?:(?<host>[^: ]+) ?:?)?\s*(?<ident>.*CEF.+?(?=0\|)|%ASA[0-9\-]{8,10})\s*:?(?<message>0\|.*|.*)/
        <parse>
            message_format auto
        </parse>
    </source>

    <filter oms.security.**>
        type filter_syslog_security
    </filter>
    ```

1. Checks if there are any security enhancements on the machine that might be blocking network traffic (such as a host firewall).

1. Checks that the syslog daemon (rsyslog) is properly configured to send messages that it identifies as CEF (using a regex) to the Log Analytics agent on TCP port 25226:

    - Configuration file: `/etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf`

        ```console
        :rawmsg, regex, "CEF"|"ASA"
        *.* @@127.0.0.1:25226
        ```
  
1. Checks that the syslog daemon is receiving data on port 514

1. Checks that the necessary connections are established: tcp 514 for receiving data, tcp 25226 for internal communication between the syslog daemon and the Log Analytics agent

1. Sends MOCK data to port 514 on localhost. This data should be observable in the Azure Sentinel workspace by running the following query:

    ```console
    CommonSecurityLog
    | where DeviceProduct == "MOCK"
    ```

# [syslog-ng daemon](#tab/syslogng)

1. Checks that the file<br>
    `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/[WorkspaceID]/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf`<br>
    exists and is valid.

1. Checks that the file includes the following text:

    ```console
    <source>
        type syslog
        port 25226
        bind 127.0.0.1
        protocol_type tcp
        tag oms.security
        format /(?<time>(?:\w+ +){2,3}(?:\d+:){2}\d+|\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.[\w\-\:\+]{3,12}):?\s*(?:(?<host>[^: ]+) ?:?)?\s*(?<ident>.*CEF.+?(?=0\|)|%ASA[0-9\-]{8,10})\s*:?(?<message>0\|.*|.*)/
        <parse>
            message_format auto
        </parse>
    </source>

    <filter oms.security.**>
        type filter_syslog_security
    </filter>
    ```

1. Checks if there are any security enhancements on the machine that might be blocking network traffic (such as a host firewall).

1. Checks that the syslog daemon (syslog-ng) is properly configured to send messages that it identifies as CEF (using a regex) to the Log Analytics agent on TCP port 25226:

    - Configuration file: `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/security-config-omsagent.conf`

        ```console
        filter f_oms_filter {match(\"CEF\|ASA\" ) ;};
        destination oms_destination {tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port("25226"));};
        log {source(s_src);filter(f_oms_filter);destination(oms_destination);};
        ```

1. Checks that the syslog daemon is receiving data on port 514

1. Checks that the necessary connections are established: tcp 514 for receiving data, tcp 25226 for internal communication between the syslog daemon and the Log Analytics agent

1. Sends MOCK data to port 514 on localhost. This data should be observable in the Azure Sentinel workspace by running the following query:

    ```console
    CommonSecurityLog
    | where DeviceProduct == "MOCK"
    ```
