# STEP 3: Validate connectivity



After you deployed the agent and configured your security solution to forward CEF messages, use this article to understand how to verify connectivity between Azure Sentinel and your security solution. 

## How to validate connectivity

1. Open Log Analytics to make sure that logs are received using the CommonSecurityLog schema.<br> It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics. 

1. Before you run the script, we recommend that you send messages from your security solution to make sure they are being forwarded to the Syslog proxy machine you configured. 
1. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine. Make sure that you have Python on your machine using the following command: `python â€“version`
1. Run the following script to check connectivity between the agent, Azure Sentinel, and your security solution. It checks that the daemon forwarding is properly configured, listens on the correct ports, and that nothing is blocking communication between the daemon and the Log Analytics agent. The script also sends mock messages 'TestCommonEventFormat' to check end-to-end connectivity. <br>
 `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_troubleshoot.py&&sudo python cef_troubleshoot.py [WorkspaceID]`
