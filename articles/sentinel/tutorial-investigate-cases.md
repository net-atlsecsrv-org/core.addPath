# Tutorial: Investigate cases with Azure Sentinel Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This tutorial helps you detect threats with Azure Sentinel.

After you [connected your data sources](quickstart-onboard.md) to Azure Sentinel, you want to be notified when something suspicious happens. To enable you to do this, Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules, that generate cases that you can assign and use to deeply investigate anomalies and threats in your environment.

## Investigate cases

A case can include multiple alerts. It's an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for a specific investigation. A case is created based on alerts you defined in the **Analytics** page. The properties related to the alerts, such as severity and status are set at the case level. 
After you let Azure Sentinel know what kinds of threats you're looking for and how to find them, you can monitor threats that are detected by investigating cases. 

1. Select **Cases**. The **Cases** page lets you know how many cases you have, how many are open, how many you've set to **In progress**, and how many are closed. For each case, you can see the time it occurred, and the status of the case. Look at the severity to decide what to handle first. In the **Cases** page, click the **Alerts** tab to see all the alerts that are related to a case. Entities that you mapped earlier as part of the case can be viewed in the **Entities** tab.  You can filter the cases as needed, for example by status or severity. When you look at the **Cases** tab, you'll see open cases that contain alerts triggered by your detection rules defined in **Analytics**. Across the top you'll see your active cases, new cases and in progress cases. You can also see an overview of all your cases by severity.

2. To begin an investigation, click on a specific case. On the right, you can see detailed information for the case including its severity, summary of the number of entities involved (based on your mapping). Each case has a unique ID. The severity of the case is determined according to the most severe alert included in the case.  

1. To view more details about the alerts and entities in the case, click on **View full details** in the case page and review the relevant tabs that summarize the case information.  Full case view consolidates all evidence in the alert, the associated alerts, and entities.

1. In the **Alerts** tab, review the alert itself - when it was triggered and by how much it exceeded the thresholds you set. You can see all relevant information about the alert â€“ the query that triggered the alert, the number of results returned per query, and the ability to run playbooks on the alerts. To drill down even further into the case, click on the number of hits. This opens the query that generated the results and the results that triggered the alert in Log Analytics.

3. In the **Entities** tab, you can see all the entities that you mapped as part of the alert rule definition. 

4. If you're actively investigating a case, it's a good idea to set the case status to **In progress** until you close it. You can also close the case, where **closed resolved** is the status for cases that indicate that an incident was handled, while **closed dismissed**  is the status for cases that don't require handling. Explanations are required explaining your reasoning for closing a case.

5. Cases can be assigned to a specific user. For each case you can assign an owner, by setting the case **owner** field. All cases start as unassigned. You can go into the cases and filter by your name to see all the cases that you own. 

5. Click **Investigate** to view the investigation map and scope of the breach with remediation steps. 



## Respond to threats

Azure Sentinel gives you two primary options for responding to threats using playbooks. You can set a playbook to run automatically when an alert is triggered, or you can manually run a playbook in response to an alert.

- You can set a playbook to run automatically when an alert is triggered when you configure the playbook. 

- You can manually run a playbook from inside the alert, by clicking **View playbooks** and then selecting a playbook to run.
