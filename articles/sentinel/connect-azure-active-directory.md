# Connect data from Azure Active Directory

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Sentinel enables you to collect data from [Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) and stream it into Azure Sentinel. You can choose to stream  [sign-in logs](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md) and [audit logs](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md) .

## Prerequisites

- If you want to export sign-in data from Active Directory, you must have an Azure AD P1 or P2 license.

- User with global admin or security admin permissions on the tenant you want to stream the logs from.


## Connect to Azure AD

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then click the **Azure Active Directory** tile.

2. Next to the logs you want to stream into Azure Sentinel, click **Connect**.

6. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Azure AD alerts, search for **SigninLogs** and **AuditLogs**.
