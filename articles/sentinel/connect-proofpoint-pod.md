# Connect your Proofpoint On Demand Email Security (POD) solution to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Proofpoint On Demand Email Security connector is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article explains how to connect your Proofpoint On Demand Email Security appliance to Azure Sentinel. The POD data connector allows you to easily connect your POD logs with Azure Sentinel, so that you can view the data in workbooks, use it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve investigation.  Integration between Proofpoint On Demand Email Security and Azure Sentinel makes use of Websocket API.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Prerequisites

- You must have read and write permission on the Azure Sentinel workspace.

- You must have read permissions to shared keys for the workspace. [Learn more about workspace keys](../azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent.md#workspace-id-and-key).

- You must have read and write permissions to Azure Functions in order to create a Function App. [Learn more about Azure Functions](../azure-functions/index.yml).

- You must have the following Websocket API credentials: ProofpointClusterID, ProofpointToken. [Learn more about Websocket API](https://proofpointcommunities.force.com/community/s/article/Proofpoint-on-Demand-Pod-Log-API).

## Configure and connect Proofpoint On Demand Email Security

Proofpoint On Demand Email Security can integrate and export logs directly to Azure Sentinel.

1. In the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select **Data connectors**.

1. From the **Data connectors** gallery, select **Proofpoint On Demand Email Security (Preview)** and then **Open connector page**.

1. Follow the steps described in the **Configuration** section of the connector page.

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in **Logs**, under *Custom Logs*, in the following tables:
- `ProofpointPOD_message_CL`
- `ProofpointPOD_maillog_CL`

See the **Next steps** tab in the connector page for some useful sample queries.

## Validate connectivity

It may take up to 60 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
