# Connect data from Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).


You can stream logs from [Azure Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp) into Azure Sentinel with a single click.

## Prerequisites

- User with global administrator or security administrator permissions
- You must be a preview customer of Azure ATP

## Connect to Azure ATP

Make sure the Azure ATP preview version is [enabled on your network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/install-atp-step1).
If Azure ATP is deployed and ingesting your data, the suspicious alerts can easily be streamed into Azure Sentinel. It may take up to 24 hours for the alerts to start streaming into Azure Sentinel.


1. To connect Azure ATP to Azure Sentinel, you must first enable integration between Azure ATP and Microsoft Cloud App Security. For information on how to do this, see [Azure Advanced Threat Protection integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/aatp-integration).

1. In Azure Sentinel, select **Data connectors** and then click the **Azure ATP** tile.

2. Click **Connect**.

6. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Azure ATP alerts, search for **SecurityAlert**.
