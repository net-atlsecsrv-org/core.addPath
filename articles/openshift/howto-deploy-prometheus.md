# Deploy a standalone Prometheus in an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

This guide will describe how to configure a standalone Prometheus with service discovery in an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.  “Customer admin” access to the cluster is NOT needed.

The target setup is as follows:

- one project (prometheus-project), which contains Prometheus and Alertmanager
- two projects (app-project1 and app-project2), which contain the applications to monitor

You'll prepare some Prometheus configuration files locally. Create a new folder to store them.
These config files will be stored in the cluster as Secrets in case secret tokens are added to them later.

## Step 1: Sign in to the cluster using the `oc` tool
Using a web browser, navigate to the web console of your cluster (https://openshift.*random-id*.*region*.azmosa.io).
Sign in with your Azure credentials.
Click your username in top right and select "Copy Login Command". Paste it into the terminal you'll use.

You can verify if you're signed in to the correct cluster with the `oc whoami -c` command.

## Step 2: Prepare the projects

Create projects.
```
oc new-project prometheus-project
oc new-project app-project1
oc new-project app-project2
```


> [!NOTE]
> You can either use the `-n` or `--namespace` parameter or select an active project with the `oc project` command

## Step 3: Prepare Prometheus config
Create a file called prometheus.yml with the following content.
```
global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
  evaluation_interval: 5s

scrape_configs:
    - job_name: prom-sd
      scrape_interval: 30s
      scrape_timeout: 10s
      metrics_path: /metrics
      scheme: http
      kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - api_server: null
        role: endpoints
        namespaces:
          names:
          - prometheus-project
          - app-project1
          - app-project2
```
Create a Secret named "prom" with the configuration.
```
oc create secret generic prom --from-file=prometheus.yml -n prometheus-project
```

The file listed above is a basic Prometheus config file.
It sets the intervals and configures auto discovery in three projects (prometheus-project, app-project1, app-project2).
In this example, the auto discovered endpoints will be scraped over HTTP without authentication.
For more information on scraping endpoints,
see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config.


## Step 4: Prepare Alertmanager config
Create a file called alertmanager.yml with the following content.
```
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 12h
  receiver: default
  routes:
  - match:
      alertname: DeadMansSwitch
    repeat_interval: 5m
    receiver: deadmansswitch
receivers:
- name: default
- name: deadmansswitch
```
Create a Secret named "prom-alerts" with the configuration.
```
oc create secret generic prom-alerts --from-file=alertmanager.yml -n prometheus-project
```

The file listed above is the Alert Manager configuration file.

> [!NOTE]
> You can verify the two previous steps with `oc get secret -n prometheus-project`

## Step 5: Start Prometheus and Alertmanager
Download the [prometheus-standalone.yaml](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/release-3.11/examples/prometheus/prometheus-standalone.yaml)
Template from the [openshift/origin repository](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/release-3.11/examples/prometheus)
and apply it in the prometheus-project
```
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/release-3.11/examples/prometheus/prometheus-standalone.yaml | oc apply -f - -n prometheus-project
```
The prometheus-standalone.yaml file is an OpenShift Template, which will create a Prometheus instance
with an oauth-proxy in front of it and an Alertmanager instance, also secured with oauth-proxy.  In this Template oauth-proxy is configured to allow any User who can "get" the "prometheus-project" namespace (see the `-openshift-sar` flag).

> [!NOTE]
> You can verify if the "prom" StatefulSet has equal *DESIRED* and *CURRENT* number replicas
> with the `oc get statefulset -n prometheus-project` command.
> You can also check all resources in the project with `oc get all -n prometheus-project`.

## Step 6: Add permissions to allow Service Discovery
Create prometheus-sdrole.yml with the following content.
```
apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: prometheus-sdrole
  annotations:
    "openshift.io/display-name": Prometheus Service Discovery Role
    description: |
      A role and rolebinding adding permissions required to perform Service Discovery in a given project.
    iconClass: fa fa-cogs
    tags: "monitoring,prometheus,alertmanager,time-series"
parameters:
- description: The project name, where a standalone Prometheus is deployed
  name: PROMETHEUS_PROJECT
  value: prometheus-project
objects:
- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Role
  metadata:
    name: prometheus-sd
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    resources:
    - services
    - endpoints
    - pods
    verbs:
    - list
    - get
    - watch
- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
    name: prometheus-sd
  roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Role
    name: prometheus-sd
  subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: prom
    namespace: ${PROMETHEUS_PROJECT}
```
Apply the template to all projects where you would like to allow service discovery.
```
oc process -f prometheus-sdrole.yml | oc apply -f - -n app-project1
oc process -f prometheus-sdrole.yml | oc apply -f - -n app-project2
```
If you'd also like Prometheus to be able to gather metrics from itself, remember to apply the permissions in prometheus-project too.

> [!NOTE]
> You can verify if the Role and RoleBinding were created correctly with the `oc get role` and `oc get rolebinding` commands respectively

## Optional: Deploy example application
Everything is working, but there are no metrics sources. Go to the Prometheus URL (https://prom-prometheus-project.apps.*random-id*.*region*.azmosa.io/), which can be found with the following command.
```
oc get route prom -n prometheus-project
```
Remember to prefix the hostname with https://.

The **Status > Service Discovery** page will show 0/0 active targets.

To deploy an example application, which exposes basic python metrics under the /metrics endpoint run the following commands.
```
oc new-app python:3.6~https://github.com/Makdaam/prometheus-example --name=example1 -n app-project1
oc new-app python:3.6~https://github.com/Makdaam/prometheus-example --name=example2 -n app-project2
```
The new applications will appear as valid targets on the Service Discovery page within 30s after deployment. You can get more details on the **Status > Targets** page.

> [!NOTE]
> For every successfully scraped target Prometheus adds a datapoint in the "up" metric. Click **Prometheus** in the top left corner and enter "up" as the expression and click **Execute**.

## Next steps

You can add custom Prometheus instrumentation to your applications.

The Prometheus Client library, which simplifies preparing Prometheus metrics, is ready for different programming languages.
