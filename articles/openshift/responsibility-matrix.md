# Overview of responsibilities for Azure Red Hat OpenShift

This document outlines the responsibilities of Microsoft, Red Hat, and customers for Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters. For more information about Azure Red Hat OpenShift and its components, see the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Service Definition.

While Microsoft and Red Hat manage the Azure Red Hat OpenShift service, the customer shares responsibility for the functionality of their cluster. While Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters are hosted on Azure resources in customer Azure subscriptions, they are accessed remotely. Underlying platform and data security is owned by Microsoft and Red Hat.
