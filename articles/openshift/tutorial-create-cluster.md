# Tutorial: Create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster

In this tutorial, part one of three, you'll prepare your environment to create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster running OpenShift 4, and create a cluster. You will learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Setup the prerequisites and create the required virtual network and subnets
> * Deploy a cluster

## Before you begin

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.6.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription does not meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, see [Standard quota: Increase limits by VM series](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md).

### Verify your permissions

To create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster, verify the following permissions on your Azure subscription, Azure Active Directory user, or service principal:

|Permissions|Resource Group which contains the VNet|User executing `az aro create`|Service Principal passed as `â€“client-id`|
|----|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|**User Access Administrator**|X|X| |
|**Contributor**|X|X|X|

### Register the resource providers

1. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, specify the relevant subscription ID:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az account set --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION ID>
    ```

1. Register the `Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift` resource provider:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az provider register -n Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift --wait
    ```
    
1. Register the `Microsoft.Compute` resource provider:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az provider register -n Microsoft.Compute --wait
    ```
    
1. Register the `Microsoft.Storage` resource provider:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az provider register -n Microsoft.Storage --wait
    ```

### Get a Red Hat pull secret (optional)

A Red Hat pull secret enables your cluster to access Red Hat container registries along with additional content. This step is optional but recommended.

1. **[Navigate to your Red Hat OpenShift cluster manager portal](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/aro-provisioned) and log in.**

   You will need to log in to your Red Hat account or create a new Red Hat account with your business email and accept the terms and conditions.

2. Go to the [**OpenShift product page**](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers) if this is your first time creating a cluster. After registration, head to [**Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager page**](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/), where you can click **Download pull secret** and download a pull secret to be used with your ARO cluster.

Keep the saved `pull-secret.txt` file somewhere safe. The file will be used in each cluster creation if you need to create a cluster that includes samples or operators for Red Hat or certified partners.

When running the `az aro create` command, you can reference your pull secret using the `--pull-secret @pull-secret.txt` parameter. Execute `az aro create` from the directory where you stored your `pull-secret.txt` file. Otherwise, replace `@pull-secret.txt` with `@<path-to-my-pull-secret-file>`.

If you are copying your pull secret or referencing it in other scripts, your pull secret should be formatted as a valid JSON string.

### Prepare a custom domain for your cluster (optional)

When running the `az aro create` command, you can specify a custom domain for your cluster by using the `--domain foo.example.com` parameter.

If you provide a custom domain for your cluster note the following points:

* After creating your cluster, you must create 2 DNS A records in your DNS server for the `--domain` specified:
    * **api** - pointing to the api server
    * **\*.apps** - pointing to the ingress
    * Retrieve these values by executing the following command: `az aro show -n -g --query '{api:apiserverProfile.ip, ingress:ingressProfiles[0].ip}'`.

* The OpenShift console will be available at a URL such as `https://console-openshift-console.apps.foo.example.com`, instead of the built-in domain `https://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io`.

* By default, OpenShift uses self-signed certificates for all of the routes created on `*.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io`.  If you choose to use custom DNS after connecting to the cluster, you will need to follow the OpenShift documentation to [configure a custom CA for your ingress controller](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/certificates/replacing-default-ingress-certificate.html) and a [custom CA for your API server](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/certificates/api-server.html).

### Create a virtual network containing two empty subnets

Next, you will create a virtual network containing two empty subnets.

1. **Set the following variables in the shell environment in which you will execute the `az` commands.**

   ```console
   LOCATION=eastus                 # the location of your cluster
   RESOURCEGROUP=aro-rg            # the name of the resource group where you want to create your cluster
   CLUSTER=cluster                 # the name of your cluster
   ```

2. **Create a resource group.**

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you are asked to specify a location. This location is where resource group metadata is stored, it is also where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation. Create a resource group using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az-group-create) command.
    
> [!NOTE] 
> Azure Red Hat OpenShift is not available in all regions where an Azure resource group can be created. See [Available regions](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/welcome/index.html#available-regions) for information on where Azure Red Hat OpenShift is supported.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create \
  --name $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --location $LOCATION
```

The following example output shows the resource group created successfully:

```json
    {
    "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/aro-rg",
    "location": "eastus",
    "managedBy": null,
    "name": "aro-rg",
    "properties": {
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
    },
    "tags": null
    }
```

3. **Create a virtual network.**

Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters running OpenShift 4 require a virtual network with two empty subnets, for the master and worker nodes.

Create a new virtual network in the same resource group you created earlier:

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet create \
   --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
   --name aro-vnet \
   --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/22
```

The following example output shows the virtual network created successfully:

```json
    {
    "newVNet": {
        "addressSpace": {
        "addressPrefixes": [
            "10.0.0.0/22"
        ]
        },
        "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/aro-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/aro-vnet",
        "location": "eastus",
        "name": "aro-vnet",
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
        "resourceGroup": "aro-rg",
        "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks"
    }
    }
```

4. **Add an empty subnet for the master nodes.**

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
    --vnet-name aro-vnet \
    --name master-subnet \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/23 \
    --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
    ```

5. **Add an empty subnet for the worker nodes.**

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
    --vnet-name aro-vnet \
    --name worker-subnet \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/23 \
    --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
    ```

6. **[Disable subnet private endpoint policies](../private-link/disable-private-link-service-network-policy.md) on the master subnet.** This is required to be able to connect and manage the cluster.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network vnet subnet update \
    --name master-subnet \
    --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
    --vnet-name aro-vnet \
    --disable-private-link-service-network-policies true
    ```

## Create the cluster

Run the following command to create a cluster. If you choose to use either of the following options, modify the command accordingly:
* Optionally, you can [pass your Red Hat pull secret](#get-a-red-hat-pull-secret-optional) which enables your cluster to access Red Hat container registries along with additional content. Add the `--pull-secret @pull-secret.txt` argument to your command.
* Optionally, you can [use a custom domain](#prepare-a-custom-domain-for-your-cluster-optional). Add the `--domain foo.example.com` argument to your command, replacing `foo.example.com` with your own custom domain.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're adding any optional arguments to your command, be sure to close the argument on the preceding line of the command with a trailing backslash.

```azurecli-interactive
az aro create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name $CLUSTER \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet
```

After executing the `az aro create` command, it normally takes about 35 minutes to create a cluster.
