## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster was created and connected to using the OpenShift web console. If you have not done these steps, and would like to follow along, start with [Tutorial 1 - Create an Azure Red Hat Openshift 4 Cluster.](tutorial-create-cluster.md)

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.6.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Sign in to Azure

If you're running the Azure CLI locally, run `az login` to sign in to Azure.

```bash
az login
```

If you have access to multiple subscriptions, run `az account set -s {subscription ID}` replacing `{subscription ID}` with the subscription you want to use.

## Delete the cluster

In previous tutorials, the following variables were set.

```bash
CLUSTER=yourclustername
RESOURCEGROUP=yourresourcegroup
```

Using these values, delete your cluster:

```bash
az aro delete --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP --name $CLUSTER
```

You'll then be prompted to confirm if you want to delete the cluster. After you confirm with `y`, it will take several minutes to delete the cluster. When the command finishes, the entire resource group and all resources inside it—including the cluster—will be deleted.
