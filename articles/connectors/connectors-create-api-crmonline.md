# Create and manage records in Dynamics 365 by using Azure Logic Apps

Dynamics 365 uses the [Common Data Service](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). For connections to Dynamics 365, use the [Common Data Service connector](/connectors/commondataservice/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Dynamics 365 connector](/connectors/dynamicscrmonline/) is deprecated, 
> but continues to work until removed. Do not use the Dynamics 365 connector for new logic apps. 
> No timeline is yet announced for removing the Dynamics 365 connector. You're not required to 
> convert existing logic apps to the Common Data Service connector or other planned new connector, 
> but you need convert your logic apps when the connector is removed. For more information, see 
> [Dynamics 365 Connector is deprecated](/power-platform/important-changes-coming).
>
> The [Common Data Service connector](/connectors/commondataservice/) 
> provides the same capabilities as the deprecated Dynamics 365 connector, but includes improvements 
> that increase reliability. For information about using the Common Data Service connector in logic apps, see 
> [Create and manage Common Data Service records by using Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connect-common-data-service.md).
