# Built-in triggers and actions for Logic Apps


[Built-in triggers and actions](apis-list.md) provide ways for you to [control your workflow's schedule and structure](#control-workflow), [run your own code](#run-code-from-workflows), [manage or manipulate data](#manage-or-manipulate-data), and complete other tasks in your workflows. Different from [managed connectors](managed.md), many built-in operations aren't tied to a specific service, system, or protocol. For example, you can start almost any workflow on a schedule by using the Recurrence trigger. Or, you can have your workflow wait until called by using the Request trigger. All built-in operations run natively in the Logic Apps service, and most don't require that you create a connection before you use them. 

Logic Apps also provides built-in operations for a smaller number of services, systems, and protocols, such as Azure Functions, Azure App Services, Azure API Management, AS2, and so on. This selection varies based on whether you create a multi-tenant logic app or single-tenant logic app. For example, if you create a single-tenant logic app, built-in operations are available for Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, SQL Server, and MQ. In a few cases, both a built-in version and a managed connector version are available. In most cases, the built-in version provides better performance, capabilities, pricing, and so on. For example, to [exchange B2B messages using the AS2 protocol](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2.md), select the built-in version unless you need tracking capabilities, which are available only in the (deprecated) managed connector version.

The following list describes only some of the tasks that you can accomplish with [built-in triggers and actions](#understand-triggers-and-actions):

- Run workflows using custom and advanced schedules. For more information about scheduling, review the [recurrence behavior section in the Logic Apps connector overview](apis-list.md#recurrence-behavior).
- Organize and control your workflow's structure, for example, using loops and conditions.
- Work with variables, dates, data operations, content transformations, and batch operations.
- Communicate with other endpoints using HTTP triggers and actions.
- Receive and respond to requests.
- Call your own functions (Azure Functions), web apps (Azure App Services), APIs (Azure API Management), other Logic Apps workflows that can receive requests, and so on.

## Understand triggers and actions

Logic Apps provides the following built-in triggers and actions:

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        [![Schedule icon in Logic Apps][schedule-icon]][schedule-doc]
        \
        \
        [**Schedule**][schedule-doc]
        \
        \

        \
        \
        [**Sliding Window**][schedule-sliding-window-doc]: Trigger a workflow that needs to handle data in continuous chunks.
        \
        \
        [**Delay**][schedule-delay-doc]: Pause your workflow for the specified duration.
        \

        [**Batch**][batch-doc]
        \
        \
        [**Batch messages**][batch-doc]: Trigger a workflow that processes messages in batches.
        \
        \
        [**Send messages to batch**][batch-doc]: Call an existing workflow that currently starts with a **Batch messages** trigger.
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::

        \
        \
        [**HTTP**][http-doc]
        \
        \
        Call an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint by using either the HTTP trigger or action. 
        \
        \
        You can also use these other built-in HTTP triggers and actions: 
        - [HTTP + Swagger][http-swagger-doc]
        - [HTTP + Webhook][http-webhook-doc]
    :::column-end:::

        \
        \
        [**When a HTTP request is received**][http-request-doc]: Wait for a request from another workflow, app, or service. This trigger makes your workflow callable without having to be checked or polled on a schedule.
        \
        \
        [**Response**][http-request-doc]: Respond to a request received by the **When a HTTP request is received** trigger in the same workflow.

        [**Azure API Management**][azure-api-management-doc]
        \
        \
        Call your own triggers and actions in APIs that you define, manage, and publish using [Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-key-concepts.md). <p><p>**Note**: Not supported when using [Consumption tier for API Management](../api-management/api-management-features.md).

        \
        \
        Call apps that you create and host on [Azure App Service](../app-service/overview.md), for example, API Apps and Web Apps.
        \
        \
        When Swagger is included, the triggers and actions defined by these apps appear like any other first-class triggers and actions in Azure Logic Apps.
