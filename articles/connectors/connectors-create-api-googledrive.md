# Get started with the Google Drive connector
Connect to Google Drive to create files, get rows, and more. With Google Drive, you can: 

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from your search. 
* Use actions to search images, search the news, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, you can search for a video, and then use Twitter to post that video to a Twitter feed.

You can get started by creating a logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create the connection to Google Drive
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must authorize logic apps to connect to your Google Drive.

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to googledrive](../../includes/connectors-create-api-googledrive.md)]
> 
> 

After you create the connection, you enter the Google Drive properties, like the folder path or file name. 

## Connector-specific details
