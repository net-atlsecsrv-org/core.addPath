# Create, monitor, and manage FTP files by using Azure Logic Apps

With Azure Logic Apps and the FTP connector, you can create automated tasks and workflows that create, monitor, send, and receive files through your account on an FTP server, along with other actions, for example:

* Monitor when files are added or changed.
* Get, create, copy, update, list, and delete files.
* Get file content and metadata.
* Extract archives to folders.

You can use triggers that get responses from your FTP server and make the output available to other actions. You can use run actions in your logic apps for managing files on your FTP server. You can also have other actions use the output from FTP actions. For example, if you regularly get files from your FTP server, you can send email about those files and their content by using the Office 365 Outlook connector or Outlook.com connector. If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Limits

* The FTP connector supports only explicit FTP over SSL (FTPS) and isn't compatible with implicit FTPS.

* By default, FTP actions can read or write files that are *50 MB or smaller*. To handle files larger than 50 MB, FTP actions support [message chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). The **Get file content** action implicitly uses chunking.

* FTP triggers don't support chunking. When requesting file content, triggers select only files that are 50 MB or smaller. To get files larger than 50 MB, follow this pattern:

  * Use an FTP trigger that returns file properties, such as **When a file is added or modified (properties only)**.

  * Follow the trigger with the FTP **Get file content** action, which reads the complete file and implicitly uses chunking.

## How FTP triggers work

FTP triggers work by polling the FTP file system and looking for any file that was changed since the last poll. Some tools let you preserve the timestamp when the files change. In these cases, you have to disable this feature so your trigger can work. Here are some common settings:

| SFTP client | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Winscp | Go to **Options** > **Preferences** > **Transfer** > **Edit** > **Preserve timestamp** > **Disable** |
| FileZilla | Go to **Transfer** > **Preserve timestamps of transferred files** > **Disable** |
|||

When a trigger finds a new file, the trigger checks that the new file is complete, and not partially written. For example, a file might have changes in progress when the trigger checks the file server. To avoid returning a partially written file, the trigger notes the timestamp for the file that has recent changes, but doesn't immediately return that file. The trigger returns the file only when polling the server again. Sometimes, this behavior might cause a delay that is up to twice the trigger's polling interval.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* Your FTP host server address and account credentials

  The FTP connector requires that your FTP server is accessible from the internet and set up to operate in *passive* mode. Your credentials let your logic app create a connection and access your FTP account.

* Basic knowledge about [how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

* The logic app where you want to access your FTP account. To start with an FTP trigger, [create a blank logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md). To use an FTP action, start your logic app with another trigger, for example, the **Recurrence** trigger.

## Connect to FTP

[!INCLUDE [Create connection general intro](../../includes/connectors-create-connection-general-intro.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and open your logic app in Logic App Designer, if not open already.

1. For blank logic apps, in the search box, enter "ftp" as your filter. Under the triggers list, select the trigger you want.

   -or-

   For existing logic apps, under the last step where you want to add an action, choose **New step**, and then select **Add an action**. In the search box, enter "ftp" as your filter. Under the actions list, select the action you want.

   To add an action between steps, move your pointer over the arrow between steps. Choose the plus sign (**+**) that appears, and select **Add an action**.

1. Provide the necessary details for your connection, and then choose **Create**.

1. Provide the necessary details for your selected trigger or action and continue building your logic app's workflow.

## Examples

<a name="file-added-modified"></a>

### FTP trigger: When a file is added or modified

This trigger starts a logic app workflow when the trigger detects when a file is added or changed on an FTP server. So for example, you can add a condition that checks the file's content and decides whether to get that content, based on whether that content meets a specified condition. Finally, you can add an action that gets the file's content, and put that content in a folder on the SFTP server.

**Enterprise example**: You can use this trigger to monitor an FTP folder for new files that describe customer orders. You can then use an FTP action such as **Get file content**, so you can get the order's contents for further processing and store that order in an orders database.

Here is an example that shows this trigger: **When a file is added or modified**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and open your logic app in Logic App Designer, if not open already.

1. For blank logic apps, in the search box, enter "ftp" as your filter. Under the triggers list, select this trigger: **When a filed is added or modified - FTP**

   ![Find and select FTP trigger](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/select-ftp-trigger.png)  

1. Provide the necessary details for your connection, and then choose **Create**.

   By default, this connector transfers files in text format. To transfer files in binary format, for example, where and    when encoding is used, select **Binary Transport**.

   ![Create FTP server connection](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/create-ftp-connection-trigger.png)  

1. Next to the **Folder** box, choose the folder icon so a list appears. To find the folder you want to monitor for new or edited files, select the right angle arrow (**>**), browse to that folder, and then select the folder.

   ![Find and select folder to monitor](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/select-folder.png)  

   Your selected folder appears in the **Folder** box.

   ![Selected folder](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/selected-folder.png)  

Now that your logic app has a trigger, add the actions you want to run when your logic app finds a new or edited file. For this example, you can add an FTP action that gets the new or updated content.

<a name="get-content"></a>

### FTP action: Get content

This action gets the content from a file on an FTP server when that file is added or updated. So for example, you can add the trigger from the previous example and an action that gets the file's content after that file is added or edited.

Here is an example that shows this action: **Get content**

1. Under the trigger or any other actions, choose **New step**.

1. In the search box, enter "ftp" as your filter. Under the actions list,
select this action: **Get file content - FTP**

   ![Select FTP action](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/select-ftp-action.png)  

1. If you already have a connection to your FTP server and account, go to the next step. Otherwise, provide the necessary details for that connection, and then choose **Create**.

   ![Create FTP server connection](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/create-ftp-connection-action.png)

1. After the **Get file content** action opens, click inside the **File** box so that the dynamic content list appears. You can now select properties for the outputs from previous steps. From the dynamic content list, select the **File Content** property, which has the content for the added or updated file.  

   ![Find and select file](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-action-get-file-content.png)

   The **File Content** property now appears in the **File** box.

   ![Selected "File Content" property](./media/connectors-create-api-ftp/ftp-action-selected-file-content-property.png)

1. Save your logic app. To test your workflow, add a file to the FTP folder that your logic app now monitors.
