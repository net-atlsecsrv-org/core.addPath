# Monitor and manage your Yammer account by using Azure Logic Apps

With Azure Logic Apps and the Yammer connector, 
you can create automated tasks and workflows that 
monitor and manage messages, feeds, and more 
in your Yammer account, along with other actions, for example:

* Monitor when new messages appear in followed feeds and groups.
* Get messages, groups, networks, users' details, and more.
* Post and like messages.

You can use triggers that get responses from your Yammer account and 
make the output available to other actions. You can use actions that 
perform tasks with your Yammer account. You can also have other actions 
use the output from Yammer actions. For example, when new messages appear 
in feeds or groups, you can share those messages with the Slack connector. 
If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
[sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 

* Your Yammer account and user credentials

   Your credentials authorize your logic app to create 
   a connection and access your Yammer account.

* Basic knowledge about 
[how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

* The logic app where you want to access your Yammer account. 
To start with a Yammer trigger, [create a blank logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md). 
To use a Yammer action, start your logic app with another trigger, 
for example, the **Recurrence** trigger.

## Connect to Yammer
