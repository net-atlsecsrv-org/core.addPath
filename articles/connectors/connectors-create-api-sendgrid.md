# Send emails and manage mailing lists in SendGrid by using Azure Logic Apps

With Azure Logic Apps and the SendGrid connector, 
you can create automated tasks and workflows that 
send emails and manage your recipient lists, 
for example:

* Send email.
* Add recipients to lists.
* Get, add, and manage global suppression.

You can use SendGrid actions in your logic apps to perform these tasks. 
You can also have other actions use the output from SendGrid actions. 

This connector provides only actions, so to start your logic app, 
use a separate trigger, such as a **Recurrence** trigger. 
For example, if you regularly add recipients to your lists, 
you can send email about recipients and lists using the 
Office 365 Outlook connector or Outlook.com connector.
If you're new to logic apps, review 
[What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
[sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 

* A [SendGrid account](https://www.sendgrid.com/) 
and a [SendGrid API key](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/)

   Your API key authorizes your logic app to create 
   a connection and access your SendGrid account.

* Basic knowledge about 
[how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

* The logic app where you want to access your SendGrid account. 
To use a SendGrid action, start your logic app with another trigger, 
for example, the **Recurrence** trigger.
