# Send email from your SMTP account with Azure Logic Apps

With Azure Logic Apps and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) connector, 
you can create automated tasks and workflows that send email from your SMTP account. 
You can also have other actions use the output from SMTP actions. For example, 
after your SMTP sends an email, you can notify your team in Slack with the Slack connector. 
If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
[sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 

* Your SMTP account and user credentials

  Your credentials authorize your logic app to create 
  a connection and access your SMTP account.

* Basic knowledge about 
[how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

* The logic app where you want to access your SMTP account. 
To use an SMTP action, start your logic app with a trigger, 
such as a Salesforce trigger, if you have a Salesforce account.

  For example, you can start your logic app with the 
  **When a record is created** Salesforce trigger. 
  This trigger fires each time that a new record, 
  such as a lead, is created in Salesforce. 
  You can then follow this trigger with the SMTP 
  **Send Email** action. That way, when the new 
  record is created, your logic app sends an email 
  from your SMTP account about the new record.

## Connect to SMTP
