# Get started with the Facebook connector
Connect to Facebook and post to a timeline, get a page feed, and more. With Facebook, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Facebook. 
* Use a trigger when a new post is received.
* Use actions that post to your timeline, get a page feed, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when there is a new post on your timeline, you can take that post and push it to your Twitter feed. 

You can get started by creating a logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create a connection to Facebook
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must authorize logic apps to connect to your Facebook.

1. Sign in to your Facebook account
2. Select **Authorize**, and allow your logic apps to connect and use your Facebook.
