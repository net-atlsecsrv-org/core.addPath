# Monitor and manage Wunderlist by using Azure Logic Apps

With Azure Logic Apps and the Wunderlist connector, 
you can create automated tasks and workflows that monitor 
and manage todo lists, tasks, reminders, and more in your 
Wunderlist account, along with other actions, for example:

* Monitor when new tasks get created, when tasks are due, or reminders happen.
* Create and manage lists, notes, tasks, subtasks, and more.
* Set reminders.
* Get lists, tasks, subtasks, reminders, files, notes, comments, and more.

[Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) is a service that helps you plan, 
manage, and finish your projects, todo lists, and tasks - on any device, anywhere. 
You can use triggers that get responses from your Wunderlist account 
and make the output available to other actions. You can use actions 
that perform tasks with your Wunderlist account. You can also have 
other actions use the output from Wunderlist actions. For example, 
when new tasks are due, you can post messages with the Slack connector. 
If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps?](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>. 

* Your Wunderlist account and user credentials

   Your credentials authorize your logic app to create 
   a connection and access your Wunderlist account.

* Basic knowledge about 
[how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md)

* The logic app where you want to access your Yammer account. 
To start with a Wunderlist trigger, [create a blank logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md). 
To use a Wunderlist action, start your logic app with another trigger, 
for example, the **Recurrence** trigger.
