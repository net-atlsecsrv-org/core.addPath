# Monitor and manage Wunderlist in Azure Logic Apps

As of May 6, 2020, the Wunderlist service shut down and asked customers to migrate their data and start using Microsoft To Do instead. You can use the [Microsoft To Do connector](/connectors/todo/) to replace the deprecated [Wunderlist connector](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_wunderlist/wunderlist/).

## Next steps
