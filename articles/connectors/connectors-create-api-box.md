# Create and manage files in Box with Azure Logic Apps

This article shows how you can create and manage your files 
in Box from inside a logic app with the Box connector. 
That way, you can create logic apps that automate tasks 
and workflows for managing your files and other actions, 
for example:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Box.

* Trigger automated tasks and workflow when a file is created or updated.

* Run actions that copies a file, deletes a file, and more.

  When these actions get a response, they make the output available for other actions. 
  For example, when a file is changed on Box, you can send that file in email using Office 365.

## Prerequisites

* A [Box account](https://www.box.com/home)

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>. 

* The logic app where you want to access your Box account. 
To start your logic app with a Box trigger, you need a 
[blank logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

* Basic knowledge about [how to create logic apps](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).
If you're new to logic apps, review 
[What is Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md).

## Connector reference

For technical details, such as triggers, actions, and limits,
