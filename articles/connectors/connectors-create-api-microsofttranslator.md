# Get started with the Microsoft Translator connector

Connect to Microsoft Translator to translate text, detect a language, and more. With Microsoft Translator, you can: 

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Microsoft Translator. 
* Use actions to translate text, detect a language, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when a new file is created in Dropbox, you can translate the text in the file to another language using Microsoft Translator.

You can get started by creating a logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).
