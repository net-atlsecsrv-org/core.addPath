# Azure security baseline for Azure Private Link

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Private Link. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Private Link. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Private Link have been excluded. To see how Azure Private Link completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Virtual Network security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

**Guidance**: Use the Azure Activity Log to monitor resource configurations and detect changes to your network resources related to Private Link. 

Create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to critical resources take place.

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by network resources like Private Link endpoints, Virtual Networks, and network security groups. 

Within Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure Storage Accounts for long-term/archival storage.

Also, enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM, based on organizational business requirements.

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory provides logs to help discover stale accounts. Also, use Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right users have continued access.

- [Understand Azure AD reporting](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/)

- [How to use Azure Identity Access Reviews](../active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview.md)

## Data protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Implement isolation using separate subscriptions and management groups for individual security domains such as environment type and data sensitivity level. 

Restrict the level of access to your Azure resources with your applications and enterprise environments based on business requirements. 

Control access to Azure resources via Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

Follow Security Center recommendations for encryption at rest and encryption in transit, where applicable.

- [Understand encryption in transit with Azure](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md#encryption-of-data-in-transit)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### 4.6: Use Azure RBAC to control access to resources

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access to data and resources, otherwise use service specific access control methods.

- [Familiarize yourself with a brief description and the unique ID of Azure built-in roles here](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)

Invoke PowerShell cmd "Get-AzRoleDefinition" or "az role definition list" to retrieve a list of roles in your environment.

Review your options to control the exposure of your service through "Visibility" setting. in Private Link. These visibility settings decide whether a consumer can connect to your service. 

Make your service private for consumption from your other Virtual Networks (Azure RBAC permissions only). Restrict the exposure to a limited set of trusted subscriptions, or make it public so that all Azure subscriptions can request connections on the Private Link service.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Clearly mark subscriptions (for example, production, non-production) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  

The customer is responsible to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
