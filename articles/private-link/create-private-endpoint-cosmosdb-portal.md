# Connect privately to an Azure Cosmos account using Azure Private Link

Azure Private Endpoint is the fundamental building block for Private Link in Azure. It enables Azure resources, like virtual machines (VMs), to communicate privately with Private Link resources.

In this article, you will learn how to create a VM on an Azure virtual network and an Azure Cosmos account with a Private Endpoint using the Azure portal. Then, you can securely access the Azure Cosmos account from the VM.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal.](https://portal.azure.com)

## Create a VM

## Virtual network and parameters

In this section, you will create a virtual network and the subnet to host the VM that is used to access your Private Link resource (an Azure Cosmos account in this example).

In this section you'll need to replace the following parameters in the steps with the information below:

| Parameter                   | Value                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| **\<resource-group-name>**  | myResourceGroup|
| **\<virtual-network-name>** | myVirtualNetwork         |
| **\<region-name>**          | West Central US     |
| **\<IPv4-address-space>**   | 10.1.0.0\16          |
| **\<subnet-name>**          | mySubnet        |
| **\<subnet-address-range>** | 10.1.0.0\24          |

[!INCLUDE [virtual-networks-create-new](../../includes/virtual-networks-create-new.md)]

### Create the virtual machine

1. On the upper-left side of the screen in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource** > **Compute** > **Virtual machine**.

1. In **Create a virtual machine - Basics**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **PROJECT DETAILS** | |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. You created this in the previous section.  |
    | **INSTANCE DETAILS** |  |
    | Virtual machine name | Enter *myVm*. |
    | Region | Select **WestCentralUS**. |
    | Availability options | Leave the default **No infrastructure redundancy required**. |
    | Image | Select **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter**. |
    | Size | Leave the default **Standard DS1 v2**. |
    | **ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT** |  |
    | Username | Enter a username of your choice. |
    | Password | Enter a password of your choice. The password must be at least 12 characters long and meet the [defined complexity requirements](../virtual-machines/windows/faq.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm).|
    | Confirm Password | Reenter the password. |
    | **INBOUND PORT RULES** |  |
    | Public inbound ports | Leave the default **None**. |
    | **SAVE MONEY** |  |
    | Already have a Windows license? | Leave the default **No**. |
    |||

1. Select **Next: Disks**.

1. In **Create a virtual machine - Disks**, leave the defaults and select **Next: Networking**.

1. In **Create a virtual machine - Networking**, select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Virtual network | Leave the default **MyVirtualNetwork**.  |
    | Address space | Leave the default **10.1.0.0/24**.|
    | Subnet | Leave the default **mySubnet (10.1.0.0/24)**.|
    | Public IP | Leave the default **(new) myVm-ip**. |
    | Public inbound ports | Select **Allow selected ports**. |
    | Select inbound ports | Select **HTTP** and **RDP**.|
    ||

1. Select **Review + create**. You're taken to the **Review + create** page where Azure validates your configuration.

1. When you see the **Validation passed** message, select **Create**.

## Create an Azure Cosmos account

Create an [Azure Cosmos SQL API account](../cosmos-db/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal.md#create-an-azure-cosmos-db-account). For simplicity, you can create the Azure Cosmos account in the same region as the other resources (that is "WestCentralUS").

## Create a Private Endpoint for your Azure Cosmos account

Create a Private Link for your Azure Cosmos account as described in the [Create a Private Link using the Azure portal](../cosmos-db/how-to-configure-private-endpoints.md#create-a-private-endpoint-by-using-the-azure-portal) section of the linked article.

## Connect to a VM from the internet

Connect to the VM *myVm* from the internet as follows:

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *myVm*.

1. Select the **Connect** button. After selecting the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.

1. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp*) file and downloads it to your computer.

1. Open the downloaded *.rdp* file.

    1. If prompted, select **Connect**.

    1. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may need to select **More choices** > **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive a certificate warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**.

1. Once the VM desktop appears, minimize it to go back to your local desktop.  

## Access the Azure Cosmos account privately from the VM

In this section, you will connect privately to the Azure Cosmos account using the Private Endpoint. 

1. To include the IP address and DNS mapping, sign into your Virtual machine *myVM*, open the `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` file and include the DNS information from previous step in the following format:

   [Private IP Address] [Account endpoint].documents.azure.com

   **Example:**

   10.1.255.13 mycosmosaccount.documents.azure.com

   10.1.255.14 mycosmosaccount-eastus.documents.azure.com


1. In the Remote Desktop of *myVM*, install [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=windows).

1. Select **Cosmos DB Accounts (Preview)** with the right-click.

1. Select **Connect to Cosmos DB**.

1. Select **API**.

1. Enter the connection string by pasting the information previously copied.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Connect**.

1. Browse the Azure Cosmos databases and containers from *mycosmosaccount*.

1. (Optionally) add new items to *mycosmosaccount*.

1. Close the remote desktop connection to *myVM*.

## Clean up resources

When you're done using the Private Endpoint, Azure Cosmos account and the VM, delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains: 

1. Enter *myResourceGroup* in the **Search** box at the top of the portal and select *myResourceGroup* from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter *myResourceGroup* for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this article, you created a VM on a virtual network, an Azure Cosmos account and a Private Endpoint. You connected to the VM from the internet and securely communicated to the Azure Cosmos account using Private Link.
