# Quickstart: Create a Private Endpoint using Azure portal

A Private Endpoint is the fundamental building block for private link in Azure. It enables Azure resources, like Virtual Machines (VMs), to communicate privately with private link resources. 
In this Quickstart, you will learn how to create a VM on an Azure Virtual Network, a SQL Database Server with an Azure private endpoint using the Azure portal. Then, you can securely access the SQL Database Server from the VM.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.


## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Create a VM
In this section, you will create virtual network and the subnet to host the VM that is used to access your Private Link resource (a SQL server in Azure in this example).

## Virtual network and parameters

In this section, you will create a Virtual Network and the subnet to host the VM that is used to access your Private Link resource.

In this section you'll need to replace the following parameters in the steps with the information below:

| Parameter                   | Value                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| **\<resource-group-name>**  | myResourceGroup |
| **\<virtual-network-name>** | myVirtualNetwork          |
| **\<region-name>**          | West Central US    |
| **\<IPv4-address-space>**   | 10.1.0.0\16          |
| **\<subnet-name>**          | mySubnet        |
| **\<subnet-address-range>** | 10.1.0.0\24          |

## Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP)


After you've created **myVm**, connect to it from the internet as follows: 

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *myVm*.

1. Select the **Connect** button. After selecting the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.

1. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp*) file and downloads it to your computer.

1. Open the *downloaded.rdp* file.

    1. If prompted, select **Connect**.

    1. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may need to select **More choices** > **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive a certificate warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**.

1. Once the VM desktop appears, minimize it to go back to your local desktop.  

## Access the SQL database server privately from the VM

1. In the Remote Desktop of *myVM*, open PowerShell.

2. Enter `nslookup myserver.database.windows.net`. 

    You'll receive a message similar to this:
    ```azurepowershell
    Server:  UnKnown
    Address:  168.63.129.16
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    myserver.privatelink.database.windows.net
    Address:  10.0.0.5
    Aliases:   myserver.database.windows.net
    ```
3. Install [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017).

4. In **Connect to server**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Server type| Select **Database Engine**.|
    | Server name| Select *myserver.database.windows.net* |
    | User name | Enter username as username@servername which is provided during the SQL server creation. |
    |Password |Enter a password provided during the SQL server creation. |
    |Remember password|Select **Yes**.|
    |||
1. Select **Connect**.
2. Browse databases from left menu.
3. (Optionally) Create or query information from mydatabase.
4. Close the remote desktop connection to *myVm*. 

## Clean up resources 
When you're done using the private endpoint, SQL server, and the VM, delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains: 
1. Enter *myResourceGroup* in the **Search** box at the top of the portal and select *myResourceGroup* from the search results. 
2. Select **Delete resource group**. 
3. Enter myResourceGroup for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a VM on a virtual network, a SQL database server, and a private endpoint for private access. You connected to one VM from the internet and securely communicated to the SQL database server using Private Link. To learn more about private endpoints, see [What is Azure private endpoint?](private-endpoint-overview.md).
