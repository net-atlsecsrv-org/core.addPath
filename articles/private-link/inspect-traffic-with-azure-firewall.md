# Use Azure Firewall to inspect traffic destined to a private endpoint

Azure Private Endpoint is the fundamental building block for Azure Private Link. Private endpoints enable Azure resources deployed in a virtual network to communicate privately with private link resources.

Private endpoints allow resources access to the private link service deployed in a virtual network. Access to the private endpoint through virtual network peering and on-premises network connections extend the connectivity.

You may need to inspect or block traffic from clients to the services exposed via private endpoints. Complete this inspection by using [Azure Firewall](../firewall/overview.md) or a third-party network virtual appliance.

The following limitations apply:

* Network security groups (NSGs) don't apply to private endpoints
* User-defined routes (UDR) don't apply to private endpoints
* A single route table can be attached to a subnet
* A route table supports up to 400 routes

Azure Firewall filters traffic using either:

* [FQDN in network rules](../firewall/fqdn-filtering-network-rules.md) for TCP and UDP protocols
* [FQDN in application rules](../firewall/features.md#application-fqdn-filtering-rules) for HTTP, HTTPS, and MSSQL. 

Most of the services exposed over private endpoints use HTTPS. The use of application rules over network rules is recommended when using Azure SQL.

> [!NOTE]
> SQL FQDN filtering is supported in [proxy-mode](../azure-sql/database/connectivity-architecture.md#connection-policy) only (port 1433). **Proxy** mode can result in more latency compared to *redirect*. If you want to continue using redirect mode, which is the default for clients connecting within Azure, you can filter access using FQDN in firewall network rules.

## Scenario 1: Hub and spoke architecture - Dedicated virtual network for private endpoints

:::image type="content" source="./media/inspect-traffic-using-azure-firewall/hub-and-spoke.png" alt-text="Dedicated Virtual Network for Private Endpoints" border="true":::

This scenario is the most expandable architecture to connect privately to multiple Azure services using private endpoints. A route pointing to the network address space where the private endpoints are deployed is created. This configuration reduces administrative overhead and prevents running into the limit of 400 routes.

Connections from a client virtual network to the Azure Firewall in a hub virtual network will incur charges if the virtual networks are peered.

For more information on charges related to connections with peered virtual networks, see the FAQ section of the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/) page.

>[!NOTE]
> This scenario can be implemented using any third party NVA or Azure Firewall network rules instead of application rules.

## Scenario 2: Hub and spoke architecture - Shared virtual network for private endpoints and virtual machines

:::image type="content" source="./media/inspect-traffic-using-azure-firewall/shared-spoke.png" alt-text="Private Endpoints and Virtual Machines in same Virtual Network" border="true":::

This scenario is implemented when:

* It's not possible to have a dedicated virtual network for the private endpoints

* When only a few services are exposed in the virtual network using private endpoints

The virtual machines will have /32 system routes pointing to each private endpoint. One route per private endpoint is configured to route traffic through Azure Firewall. 

The administrative overhead of maintaining the route table increases as services are exposed in the virtual network. The possibility of hitting the route limit also increases.

Depending on your overall architecture, it's possible to run into the 400 routes limit. It's recommended to use scenario 1 whenever possible.

Connections from a client virtual network to the Azure Firewall in a hub virtual network will incur charges if the virtual networks are peered.

For more information on charges related to connections with peered virtual networks, see the FAQ section of the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/) page.

>[!NOTE]
> This scenario can be implemented using any third party NVA or Azure Firewall network rules instead of application rules.

## Scenario 3: Single virtual network

:::image type="content" source="./media/inspect-traffic-using-azure-firewall/single-vnet.png" alt-text="Single virtual network" border="true":::

There's some limitations to implementation: a migration to a hub and spoke architecture isn't possible. The same considerations as in scenario 2 apply. In this scenario, virtual network peering charges don't apply.

>[!NOTE]
> If you want to implement this scenario using a third party NVA or Azure Firewall, network rules instead of application rules is required to SNAT traffic destined to the private endpoints. Otherwise communication between the virtual machines and private endpoints will fail.

## Scenario 4: On-premises traffic to private endpoints

:::image type="content" source="./media/inspect-traffic-using-azure-firewall/on-premises.png" alt-text="On-premises traffic to private endpoints" border="true":::

This architecture can be implemented if you have configured connectivity with your on-premises network using either: 

* [ExpressRoute](..\expressroute\expressroute-introduction.md)
* [Site to Site VPN](..\vpn-gateway\vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) 

If your security requirements require client traffic to services exposed via private endpoints to be routed through a security appliance, deploy this scenario.

The same considerations as in scenario 2 above apply. In this scenario, there aren't virtual network peering charges. For more information about how to configure your DNS servers to allow on-premises workloads to access private endpoints, see [On-Premises workloads using a DNS forwarder](./private-endpoint-dns.md#on-premises-workloads-using-a-dns-forwarder).

>[!NOTE]
> If you want to implement this scenario using a third party NVA or Azure Firewall, network rules instead of application rules is required to SNAT traffic destined to the private endpoints. Otherwise communication between the virtual machines and private endpoints will fail.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription.
* A Log Analytics workspace.

7. Select **Add**.

## Route traffic between the virtual machine and private endpoint through Azure Firewall

We didn't create a virtual network peering directly between virtual networks **myVMVNet** and **myPEVNet**. The virtual machine **myVM** doesn't have a route to the private endpoint we created. 

In this section, we'll create a route table with a custom route. 

The route sends traffic from the **myVM** subnet to the address space of virtual network **myPEVNet**, through the Azure Firewall.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.

2. Type **route table** in the search box and press **Enter**.

3. Select **Route table** and then select **Create**.

4. On the **Create Route table** page, use the following table to configure the route table:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** | |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**.  |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Region | Select **South Central US**. |
    | Name | Enter **VMsubnet-to-AzureFirewall**. |
    | Propagate gateway routes | Select **No**. |

5. Select **Review + create**. You're taken to the **Review + create** page where Azure validates your configuration.

6. When you see the **Validation passed** message, select **Create**.

7. Once the deployment completes select **Go to resource**.

    | Route name | Enter **myVMsubnet-to-privateendpoint**. |
    | Address prefix | Enter **10.2.0.0/16**.  |
    | Next hop type | Select **Virtual appliance**. |
    | Next hop address | Enter **10.0.0.4**. |

11. Select **OK**.

12. Select **Subnets** under **Settings**.

13. Select **+ Associate**.

14. On the **Associate subnet** page, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Virtual network | Select **myVMVNet**. |
    | Subnet | Select **VMSubnet**.  |

15. Select **OK**.

## Connect to the virtual machine from your client computer

Connect to the VM **myVm** from the internet as follows:

1. In the portal's search bar, enter **myVm-ip**.

2. Select **myVM-ip** in the search results.

3. Copy or write down the value under **IP address**.

4. If you're using Windows 10, run the following command using PowerShell. For other Windows client versions, use an SSH client like [Putty](https://www.putty.org/):

* Replace **username** with the admin username you entered during VM creation.

* Replace **IPaddress** with the IP address from the previous step.

    ```bash
    ssh username@IPaddress
    ```

5. Enter the password you defined when creating **myVm**

## Access SQL Server privately from the virtual machine

In this section, you'll connect privately to the SQL Database using the private endpoint.

1. Enter `nslookup mydbserver.database.windows.net`
    
    You'll receive a message similar to below:

    ```bash
    Server:         127.0.0.53
    Address:        127.0.0.53#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    mydbserver.database.windows.net       canonical name = mydbserver.privatelink.database.windows.net.
    Name:   mydbserver.privatelink.database.windows.net
    Address: 10.2.0.4
    ```

2. Install [SQL Server command-line tools](/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu?view=sql-server-ver15#tools).

3. Run the following command to connect to the SQL Server. Use the server admin and password you defined when you created the SQL Server in the previous steps.

* Replace **\<ServerAdmin>** with the admin username you entered during the SQL server creation.

* Replace **\<YourPassword>** with the admin password you entered during SQL server creation.

    ```bash
    sqlcmd -S mydbserver.database.windows.net -U '<ServerAdmin>' -P '<YourPassword>'
    ```
4. A SQL command prompt will be displayed on successful login. Enter **exit** to exit the **sqlcmd** tool.

5. Close the connection to **myVM** by entering **exit**.

## Validate the traffic in Azure Firewall logs

1. In the Azure portal, select **All Resources** and select your Log Analytics workspace.

2. Select **Logs** under **General** in the Log Analytics workspace page.

3. Select the blue **Get Started** button.

4. In the **Example queries** window, select **Firewalls** under **All Queries**.

5. Select the **Run** button under **Application rule log data**.

6. In the log query output, verify **mydbserver.database.windows.net** is listed under **FQDN** and **SQLPrivateEndpoint** is listed under **RuleCollection**.

## Clean up resources

When you're done using the resources, delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

1. Enter **myResourceGroup** in the **Search** box at the top of the portal and select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter **myResourceGroup** for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** and select **Delete**.

## Next steps
