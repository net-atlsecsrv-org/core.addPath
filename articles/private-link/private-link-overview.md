# What is Azure Private Link? 
Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a [private endpoint](private-endpoint-overview.md) in your virtual network.

Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own [private link service](private-link-service-overview.md) in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers. Setup and consumption using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned, and shared partner services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Private Link is now generally available. Both Private Endpoint and Private Link service (service behind standard load balancer) are generally available. Different Azure PaaS will onboard to Azure Private Link at different schedules. Check [availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-link-overview#availability) section below for accurate status of Azure PaaS on Private Link. For known limitations, see [Private Endpoint](private-endpoint-overview.md#limitations) and [Private Link Service](private-link-service-overview.md#limitations).

## Key benefits
Azure Private Link provides the following benefits:  
- **Privately access services on the Azure platform**: Connect your virtual network to services in Azure without a public IP address at the source or destination. Service providers can render their services in their own virtual network and consumers can access those services in their local virtual network. The Private Link platform will handle the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. 
 
- **On-premises and peered networks**: Access services running in Azure from on-premises over ExpressRoute private peering, VPN tunnels, and peered virtual networks using private endpoints. There's no need to set up public peering or traverse the internet to reach the service. Private Link provides a secure way to migrate workloads to Azure.
 
- **Protection against data leakage**: A private endpoint is mapped to an instance of a PaaS resource instead of the entire service. Consumers can only connect to the specific resource. Access to any other resource in the service is blocked. This mechanism provides protection against data leakage risks. 
 
- **Global reach**: Connect privately to services running in other regions. The consumer's virtual network could be in region A and it can connect to services behind Private Link in region B.  
 
- **Extend to your own services**: Enable the same experience and functionality to render your service privately to consumers in Azure. By placing your service behind a standard Azure Load Balancer, you can enable it for Private Link. The consumer can then connect directly to your service using a private endpoint in their own virtual network. You can manage the connection requests using an approval call flow. Azure Private Link works for consumers and services belonging to different Azure Active Directory tenants.

## Logging and monitoring

Azure Private Link has integration with Azure Monitor. This combination allows:

 - Archival of logs to a storage account.
 - Streaming of events to your Event Hub.
 - Azure Monitor logging.

You can access the following information on Azure Monitor: 
- **Private endpoint**: 
    - Data processed by the Private Endpoint â€¯(IN/OUT)
 
- **Private Link service**:
    - Data processed by the Private Link service (IN/OUT)
    - NAT port availability
