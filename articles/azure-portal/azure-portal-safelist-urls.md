# Safelist the Azure portal URLs on your firewall or proxy server

For good performance and connectivity between your local- or wide-area network and the Azure cloud, configure on-premises security devices to bypass security restrictions for the Azure portal URLs. Network administrators often deploy proxy servers, firewalls, or other devices to help secure and give control over how users access the internet. However, rules designed to protect users can sometimes block or slow down legitimate business-related internet traffic, including communications between you and Azure. To optimize connectivity between your network and the Azure portal and its services, we recommend you add Azure portal URLs to your safelist.

## Azure portal URLs for proxy bypass

The URL endpoints to safelist for the Azure portal are specific to the Azure cloud where your organization is deployed. Select your cloud, then add the list of URLs to your proxy server or firewall to allow network traffic to these endpoints to bypass restrictions.
