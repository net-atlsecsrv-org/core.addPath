# Export or delete user settings

You can use settings and features in the Azure portal to create a custom experience. Information about your custom settings is stored in Azure. You can export or delete the following user data:

* Private dashboards in the Azure portal
* User settings like favorite subscriptions or directories, and last logged-in directory
* Themes and other custom portal settings

It's a good idea to export and review your settings before you delete them. Rebuilding dashboards or redoing custom settings can be time-consuming.

## Export or delete your portal settings

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the header of the portal, select ![settings icon](media/azure-portal-export-delete-settings/settings-icon.png) **Settings**.

1. Select **Export all settings** or **Delete all settings and private dashboards**.

      The following table describes these actions.

      | Action | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | **Export all settings** | Creates a *.json* file that contains your user settings like your color theme, favorites, and private dashboards.|
      | **Delete all settings and private dashboards** | Deletes all links to private dashboards and other custom settings you've made to the portal. |

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the dynamic nature of user settings and risk of data corruption, you can't import settings from the *.json* file.
