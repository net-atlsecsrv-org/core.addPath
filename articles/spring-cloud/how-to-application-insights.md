# Application Insights Java In-Process Agent in Azure Spring Cloud (Preview)

This article explains how to monitor apps and microservices by using the Application Insights Java agent in Azure Spring Cloud. 

With this feature you can:

* Search tracing data with different filters.
* View dependency map of microservices.
* Check request performance.
* Monitor real-time live metrics.
* Check request failures.
* Check application metrics.

Application Insights provide many observable perspectives, including:

* Application map
* Performance
* Failures
* Metrics
* Live Metrics
* Availability

## Enable Java In-Process Agent for Application Insights

Enable Java In-Process Agent preview feature using the following procedure.

1. Go to service overview page of your service instance.
2. Click **Application Insights** entry under monitoring blade.
3. Click **Enable Application Insights** button to enable **Application Insights** integration.
4. Select an existing instance of Application Insights or create a new one.
5. Chick **Enable Java in-process agent** to enable preview Java in-process agent feature. Here you can also customize sampling rate from 0 to 100.
6.  Click **Save** to save the change.

## Portal

1. Go to the **service | Overview** page and select **Application Insights** in the **Monitoring** section. 
2. Click **Enable Application Insights** to enable Application Insights in Azure Spring Cloud.
3. Click **Enable Java in-process agent** to enable Java IPA preview feature. When an IPA preview feature is enabled, you can configure one optional sampling rate (default 10.0%).

## Using the Application Insights feature

When the **Application Insights** feature is enabled, you can:

In the left navigation pane, click **Application Insights** to jump to the **Overview** page of Application Insights. 

* Click **Application Map** to see the status of calls between applications.

* Click the link between customers-service and `petclinic` to see more details such as a query from SQL.

* In the left navigation pane, click **Performance** to see the performance data of all applications' operations, as well as dependencies and roles.

## ARM Template

To use the Azure Resource Manager template, copy following content to `azuredeploy.json`.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
            "name": "customize this",
            "apiVersion": "2020-07-01",
            "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
            "resources": [
                {
                    "type": "monitoringSettings",
                    "apiVersion": "2020-11-01-preview",
                    "name": "default",
                    "properties": {
                        "appInsightsInstrumentationKey": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
                        "appInsightsSamplingRate": 88.0
                    },
                    "dependsOn": [
                        "[resourceId('Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring', 'customize this')]"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "properties": {}
        }
    ]
}
```

## CLI

Apply ARM template with the CLI command:

* For an existing Azure Spring Cloud instance:

```azurecli
az spring-cloud app-insights update [--app-insights/--app-insights-key] "assignedName" [--sampling-rate] "samplingRate" â€“name "assignedName" â€“resource-group "resourceGroupName"
```
* For a newly created Azure Spring Cloud instance:

```azurecli
az spring-cloud create/update [--app-insights]/[--app-insights-key] "assignedName" --disable-app-insights false --enable-java-agent true --name "assignedName" â€“resource-group "resourceGroupName"
```
* To disable app-insight:

```azurecli
az spring-cloud app-insights update --disable â€“name "assignedName" â€“resource-group "resourceGroupName"

```

## Java Agent Update/Upgrade

The Java agent will be updated/upgraded regularly with the JDK, which may impact the following scenarios.

> [!Note]
> The JDK version will be updated/upgraded quarterly per year.

* Existing applications that use the Java agent before updating/upgrading will not be affected.
* Applications created after updating/upgrading will leverage the new version of the Java agent.
* Existing applications that did not previsously use the Java agent will require restart or redeployment to leverage the new version of the Java agent.

## Java Agent Configuration Hot-Loading

Azure Spring Cloud has enabled a hot-loading mechanism to adjust the settings of agent configuration without restart of applications.

> [!Note]
> The hot-loading mechanism has delay in minutes.

* When the Java agent has been previously enabled, changes to the Application Insights instance and/or SamplingRate do NOT require applications to be restarted.
* If you enable the Java agent, then you must restart applications.
* When you disable the Java agent, applications will stop to send all monitoring data after a delay in minutes. You can restart applications to remove the agent from the Java runtime environment.
