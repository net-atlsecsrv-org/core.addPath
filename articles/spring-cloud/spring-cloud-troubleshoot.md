# Troubleshoot common Azure Spring Cloud issues

This article provides instructions for troubleshooting Azure Spring Cloud development issues. For additional information, see [Azure Spring Cloud FAQ](spring-cloud-faq.md).

## Availability, performance, and application issues

### My application can't start (for example, the endpoint can't be connected, or it returns a 502 after a few retries)

Export the logs to Azure Log Analytics. The table for Spring application logs is named *AppPlatformLogsforSpring*. To learn more, see [Analyze logs and metrics with diagnostics settings](diagnostic-services.md).

The following error message might appear in your logs:

> "org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Unable to start web server"

The message indicates one of two likely problems: 
* One of the beans or one of its dependencies is missing.
* One of the bean properties is missing or invalid. In this case, "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException" will likely be displayed.

Service bindings might also cause application start failures. To query the logs, use keywords that are related to the bound services. For instance, let's assume that your application has a binding to a MySQL instance that's set to local system time. If the application fails to start, the following error message might appear in the log:

> "java.sql.SQLException: The server time zone value 'Coordinated Universal Time' is unrecognized or represents more than one time zone."

To fix this error, go to the `server parameters` of your MySQL instance, and change the `time_zone` value from *SYSTEM* to *+0:00*.


### My application crashes or throws an unexpected error

When you're debugging application crashes, start by checking the running status and discovery status of the application. To do so, go to _App management_ in the Azure portal to ensure that the statuses of all the applications are _Running_ and _UP_.

* If the status is _Running_ but the discovery status is not _UP_, go to the ["My application can't be registered"](#my-application-cant-be-registered) section.

* If the discovery status is _UP_, go to Metrics to check the application's health. Inspect the following metrics:


  - `TomcatErrorCount` (_tomcat.global.error_):
    All Spring application exceptions are counted here. If this number is large, go to Azure Log Analytics to inspect your application logs.

  - `AppMemoryMax` (_jvm.memory.max_):
    The maximum amount of memory available to the application. The amount might be undefined, or it might change over time if it is defined. If it's defined, the amount of used and committed memory is always less than or equal to max. However, a memory allocation might fail with an `OutOfMemoryError` message if the allocation attempts to increase the used memory such that *used > committed*, even if *used <= max* is still true. In such a situation, try to increase the maximum heap size by using the `-Xmx` parameter.

  - `AppMemoryUsed` (_jvm.memory.used_):
    The amount of memory in bytes that's currently used by the application. For a normal load Java application, this metric series forms a *sawtooth* pattern, where the memory usage steadily increases and decreases in small increments and suddenly drops a lot, and then the pattern recurs. This metric series occurs because of garbage collection inside Java virtual machine, where collection actions represent drops on the sawtooth pattern.
    
    This metric is important to help identify memory issues, such as:
    * A memory explosion at the very beginning.
    * The surge memory allocation for a specific logic path.
    * Gradual memory leaks.

  For more information, see [Metrics](spring-cloud-concept-metrics.md).

To learn more about Azure Log Analytics, see [Get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal).

### My application experiences high CPU usage or high memory usage

If your application experiences high CPU or memory usage, one of two things is true:
* All the app instances experience high CPU or memory usage.
* Some of the app instances experience high CPU or memory usage.

To ascertain which situation applies, do the following:

1. Go to **Metrics**, and then select either **Service CPU Usage Percentage** or **Service Memory Used**.
2. Add an **App=** filter to specify which application you want to monitor.
3. Split the metrics by **Instance**.

If *all instances* are experiencing high CPU or memory usage, you need to either scale out the application or scale up the CPU or memory usage. For more information, see [Tutorial: Scale an application in Azure Spring Cloud](spring-cloud-tutorial-scale-manual.md).

If *some instances* are experiencing high CPU or memory usage, check the instance status and its discovery status.

For more information, see [Metrics for Azure Spring Cloud](spring-cloud-concept-metrics.md).

If all instances are up and running, go to Azure Log Analytics to query your application logs and review your code logic. This will help you see whether any of them might affect scale partitioning. For more information, see [Analyze logs and metrics with diagnostics settings](diagnostic-services.md).

To learn more about Azure Log Analytics, see [Get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal). Query the logs by using the [Kusto query language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/).

### Checklist for deploying your Spring application to Azure Spring Cloud

Before you onboard your application, ensure that it meets the following criteria:

* The application can run locally with the specified Java runtime version.
* The environment config (CPU/RAM/Instances) meets the minimum requirement set by the application provider.
* The configuration items have their expected values. For more information, see [Config Server](spring-cloud-tutorial-config-server.md).
* The environment variables have their expected values.
* The JVM parameters have their expected values.
* We recommended that you disable or remove the embedded _Config Server_ and _Spring Service Registry_ services from the application package.
* If any Azure resources are to be bound via _Service Binding_, make sure the target resources are up and running.

## Configuration and management

### I encountered a problem with creating an Azure Spring Cloud service instance

When you set up an Azure Spring Cloud service instance by using the Azure portal, Azure Spring Cloud performs the validation for you.

But if you try to set up the Azure Spring Cloud service instance by using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) or the [Azure Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/), verify that:

* The subscription is active.
* The location is [supported](spring-cloud-faq.md) by Azure Spring Cloud.
* The resource group for the instance is already created.
* The resource name conforms to the naming rule. It must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character must be a letter. The last character must be a letter or number. The value must contain from 2 to 32 characters.

If you want to set up the Azure Spring Cloud service instance by using the Resource Manager template, first refer to [Understand the structure and syntax of Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates).

The name of the Azure Spring Cloud service instance will be used for requesting a subdomain name under `azureapps.io`, so the setup will fail if the name conflicts with an existing one. You might find more details in the activity logs.

### I can't deploy a JAR package

You can't upload Java Archive file (JAR)/source package by using the Azure portal or the Resource Manager template.

When you deploy your application package by using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), the Azure CLI periodically polls the deployment progress and, in the end, it displays the deployment result.

If the polling is interrupted, you can still use the following command to fetch the deployment logs:

`az spring-cloud app show-deploy-log -n <app-name>`

Ensure that your application is packaged in the correct [executable JAR format](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html). If it isn't packaged correctly, you will receive an error message similar to the following:

> "Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile /jar/38bc8ea1-a6bb-4736-8e93-e8f3b52c8714"

### I can't deploy a source package

You can't upload JAR/source package by using the Azure portal or the Resource Manager template.

When you deploy your application package by using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), the Azure CLI periodically polls the deployment progress and, in the end, it displays the deployment result.

If the polling is interrupted, you can still use the following command to fetch the build and deployment logs:

`az spring-cloud app show-deploy-log -n <app-name>`

However, note that one Azure Spring Cloud service instance can trigger only one build job for one source package at one time. For more information, see [Deploy an application](spring-cloud-quickstart-launch-app-portal.md) and [Set up a staging environment in Azure Spring Cloud](spring-cloud-howto-staging-environment.md).

### My application can't be registered

In most cases, this situation occurs when *Required Dependencies* and *Service Discovery* aren't properly configured in your Project Object Model (POM) file. Once it's configured, the built-in Service Registry server endpoint is injected as an environment variable with your application. Applications then register themselves with the Service Registry server and discover other dependent microservices.

Wait at least two minutes before a newly registered instance starts receiving traffic.

If you're migrating an existing Spring Cloud-based solution to Azure, ensure that your ad-hoc _Service Registry_ and _Config Server_ instances are removed (or disabled) to avoid conflicting with the managed instances provided by Azure Spring Cloud.

You can also check the _Service Registry_ client logs in Azure Log Analytics. For more information, see [Analyze logs and metrics with diagnostics settings](diagnostic-services.md)

To learn more about Azure Log Analytics, see [Get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal). Query the logs by using the [Kusto query language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/).

### I want to inspect my application's environment variables

Environment variables inform the Azure Spring Cloud framework, ensuring that Azure understands where and how to configure the services that make up your application. Ensuring that your environment variables are correct is a necessary first step in troubleshooting potential problems.  You can use the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint to review your environment variables.  

> [!WARNING]
> This procedure exposes your environment variables by using your test endpoint.  Do not proceed if your test endpoint is publicly accessible or if you've assigned a domain name to your application.

1. Go to `https://<your application test endpoint>/actuator/health`.  
    - A response similar to `{"status":"UP"}` indicates that the endpoint has been enabled.
    - If the response is negative, include the following dependency in your *POM.xml* file:

        ```xml
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
            </dependency>
        ```

1. With the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint enabled, go to the Azure portal and look for the configuration page of your application.  Add an environment variable with the name `MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_EXPOSURE_INCLUDE` and the value `*` . 

1. Restart your application.

1. Go to `https://<your application test endpoint>/actuator/env` and inspect the response.  It should look like this:

    ```json
    {
        "activeProfiles": [],
        "propertySources": {,
            "name": "server.ports",
            "properties": {
                "local.server.port": {
                    "value": 1025
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

Look for the child node named `systemEnvironment`.  This node contains your application's environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to reverse the exposure of your environment variables before making your application accessible to the public.  Go to the Azure portal, look for the configuration page of your application, and delete this environment variable:  `MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_EXPOSURE_INCLUDE`.

### I can't find metrics or logs for my application

Go to **App management** to ensure that the application statuses are _Running_ and _UP_.

Check to see weather _JMX_ is enabled in your application package. This feature can be enabled with the configuration property `spring.jmx.enabled=true`.  

Check to see whether the `spring-boot-actuator` dependency is enabled in your application package and that it successfully boots up.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If your application logs can be archived to a storage account but not sent to Azure Log Analytics, check to see whether you [set up your workspace correctly](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace). If you're using a free tier of Azure Log Analytics, note that [the free tier does not provide a service-level agreement (SLA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/log-analytics/v1_3/).
