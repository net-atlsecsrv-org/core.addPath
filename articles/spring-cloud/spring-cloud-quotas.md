# Quotas and Service Plans for Azure Spring Cloud

All Azure services set default limits and quotas for resources and features.   Azure Spring Cloud offers two pricing tiers: Basic and Standard. We will detail limits for both tiers in this article.

## Azure Spring Cloud service tiers and limits

| Resource | Basic | Standard
------- | ------- | -------
vCPU | 1 per service instance | 4 per service instance
Memory | 2 GB per service instance | 8 GB per service instance
Azure Spring Cloud service instances per region per subscription | 10 | 10
Total app instances per Azure Spring Cloud service instance | 25 | 500
Persistent volumes | 1 GB/app x 10 apps | 50 GB/app x 10 apps


During the preview period, Azure Spring Cloud offers only one service tier.	When you reach a limit, you'll receive a 400 error that reads: "Quota exceeds limit for subscription *your subscription* in region *region where your Azure Spring Cloud service is created*.

## Next steps

Some default limits can be increased. If your setup requires an increase, [create a support request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).
