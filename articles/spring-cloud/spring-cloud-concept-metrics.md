# Understand metrics for Azure Spring Cloud

Azure Metrics explorer is a component of the Microsoft Azure portal that allows plotting charts, visually correlating trends, and investigating spikes and dips in metrics. Use the metrics explorer to investigate the health and utilization of your resources. 

In Azure Spring Cloud, there are two view points for metrics.
* Charts in each application overview page
* Common metrics page

 ![Metrics Charts](media/metrics/metrics-1.png)

Charts in the application **Overview** provide quick status checks for each application. The common **Metrics** page contains all metrics available for reference. You can build your own charts in the common metrics page and pin them in Dashboard.

## Application overview page
Select an app in **Apps** to find charts in the overview page.  

 ![Application Metrics Management](media/metrics/metrics-2.png)

Each application's **Application Overview** page presents a metrics chart that allows you to perform a quick status check of your application.  

 ![Application Metrics Overview](media/metrics/metrics-3.png)

Azure Spring Cloud provides these five charts with metrics that are updated every minute:

* **Http Server Errors**: Error count for HTTP requests to your app
* **Data In**: Bytes received by your app
* **Data Out**: Bytes sent by your app
* **Requests**: Requests received by your app
* **Average Response Time**: Average response time from your app

For the chart, you can select a time range from one hour to seven days.

## Common metrics page

The **Metrics** in the left navigation pane links to the common metrics page.

First, select metrics to view:

![Select Metric View](media/metrics/metrics-4.png)

Details of all metrics option can be found in the [section](#user-metrics-options) below.

Next, select aggregation type for each metric:

![Metric Aggregation](media/metrics/metrics-5.png)

The aggregation type indicates how to aggregate metric points in the chart by time. There is one raw metric point every minute, and the pre-aggregation type within a minutes is pre-defined by metrics type.
* Sum: Sum all values as target output.
* Average: Use the Average value in the period as target output.
* Max/Min: Use the Max/Min value in the period as target output.

Time range to show can also be modified. The time range can be chosen from last 30 minutes to last 30 days, or a custom time range.

![Metric Modification](media/metrics/metrics-6.png)

The default view includes all of an Azure Spring Cloud service's application's metrics together. Metrics of one app or instance can be filtered in the display.  Click **Add filter**, set the property to **App**, and select the target application you want to monitor in the **Values** text box. 

You can use two kinds of filters (properties):
* App: filter by app name
* Instance: filter by app instance

![Metric Filters](media/metrics/metrics-7.png)

You can also use the **Apply splitting** option, which will draw multiple lines for one app:

>[!TIP]
> You can build your own charts in metrics page and pin them to your **Dashboard**. Start by naming your chart.  Next, select **Pin to dashboard in the top right corner**. You can now check on your application at your Portal **Dashboard**.

## User metrics options

The following tables show the available metrics and details.

### Error

>| system.cpu.usage | system.cpu.usage | Percent | Recent CPU usage for the whole system. This value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed.|

A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads.|
