## Azure Automanage for virtual machines

**What are all of the prerequisites required to enable Azure Automanage?**

The following are prerequisites for enabling Azure Automanage:
- Windows Server VMs only
- VMs must be running
- VMs must be in a supported region
- User must have correct permissions
- Non-scale set VMs only
- VMs must not link to a log analytics workspace in a different subscription
- Automanage does not support Sandbox subscriptions at this time

**What RBAC permission is needed to enable Automanage?**

If you are enabling Automanage on an VM with an existing Automanage Account, you need Contributor role to the Resource Group where the VM resides.

If you are using a new Automanage Account when enabling, you must have either the Owner role or have Contributor + User Access Administrator role to the subscription.


**What regions are supported?**

VMs in the following regions are supported: West Europe, East US, West US 2, Canada Central, West Central US.


**Which capabilities does Azure Automanage automate?**

Automanage enrolls, configures, and monitors throughout the lifecycle of the VM the services listed [here](virtual-machines-best-practices.md).

**Does Azure Automanage work with Azure Arc-enabled VMs?**

Automanage currently does not support Arc-enabled VMs.

**Can I customize configurations on Azure Automanage?**

Customers can customize settings for specific services, like Azure Backup retention, through configuration preferences. For the full list of settings that can be changed, see our documentation [here](virtual-machines-best-practices.md).


**Does Azure Automanage work with both Linux and Windows VMs?**

Currently, Automanage supports Windows Server Azure VMs.


**Can I selectively apply Automanage on only a set of VMs?**

Automanage can be enabled with click and point simplicity on selected new and existing VMs. Automanage can also be disabled at any time.


**Does Azure Automanage support VMs in a Virtual Machine Scale Set?**

No, Azure Automanage does not currently support VMs in a Virtual Machine Scale Set.


**How much does Azure Automanage cost?**

Azure Automanage is available at no additional cost in public preview. Attached Azure resources, such as Azure Backup, will incur cost.


**Can I apply Automanage through Azure policy?**

Yes, we have a built-in policy that will automatically apply Automanage to all VMs within your defined scope. You will also specify the configuration profile (DevTest or Production) along with your Automanage account. Learn more about enabling Automanage through Azure policy [here](virtual-machines-policy-enable.md).


**What is an Automanage account?**

The Automanage Account is an MSI (Managed Service Identity) that provides the security context or the identity under which the automated operations occur.


**When enabling Automanage, does it impact any additional VMs besides the VM(s) I selected?**

If your VM is linked to an existing Log Analytics workspace, we will reuse that workspace to apply these solutions: Change Tracking, Inventory, and Update Management. All VMs connected to that workspace will have those solutions enabled.


**Can I change the configuration profile of my VM?**

At this time, you will need to disable Automanage for that VM and then re-enable Automanage with the desired configuration profile and preferences.


**If my VM is already configured for a service, like Update Management, will Automanage reconfigure it?**
No, Automanage will not reconfigure it. We will begin to monitor the resources associated to that service for drift.


**Why does my VM have a Failed status in the Automanage portal?**

If you see the status as *Failed*, you can troubleshoot the deployment through the Resource Group your VM is located in. Go to **Resource groups**, select your resource group, click on **Deployments** and see the *Failed* status there along with error details.

**How can I get troubleshooting support for Automanage?**

You can file a [technical support case ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest). For the **Service** option, search for and select *Automanage* under the *Monitoring and Management* section.
