# Azure Firewall Premium Preview in the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Firewall Premium is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

 Azure Firewall Premium Preview is a next generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS inspection** - decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS** - A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering** - extends Azure Firewallâ€™s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories** - administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.

For more information, see [Azure Firewall Premium features](premium-features.md).

For **Firewall tier**, you select **Premium (preview)** and for **Firewall policy**, you select an existing Premium policy or create a new one.

## Configure the Premium policy

Configuring a Premium firewall policy is similar to configuring a Standard firewall policy. With a Premium policy, you can configure the Premium features:
