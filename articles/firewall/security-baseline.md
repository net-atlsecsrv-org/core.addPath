# Azure security baseline for Azure Firewall

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Firewall. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Firewall. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Firewall have been excluded. To see how Azure Firewall completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Firewall security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Azure Firewall is integrated with Azure Monitor for logging of traffic processed by the firewall.

Additionally, use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your network resources related to Azure Firewall.

- [Understand Network Security provided by Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-network-recommendations.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable Threat intelligence-based filtering to alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. Threat intelligence-based filtering can be enabled for your firewall to alert and deny traffic from/to-known malicious IP addresses and domains.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: In an Azure Firewall, a service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation.

Azure Firewall service tags can be used in the network rules destination field and define network access controls on Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules.

Additionally, customer-defined tags such as IP groups are also supported and can be used in a network rule or an application rule. FQDN tags in application rules are supported to allow the required outbound network traffic through your firewall.

Note that you cannot create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
