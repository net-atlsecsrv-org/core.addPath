# Tutorial: Filter inbound Internet traffic with Azure Firewall DNAT using the Azure portal

You can configure Azure Firewall Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) to translate and filter inbound Internet traffic to your subnets. When you configure DNAT, the NAT rule collection action is set to **Dnat**. Each rule in the NAT rule collection can then be used to translate your firewall public IP and port to a private IP and port. DNAT rules implicitly add a corresponding network rule to allow the translated traffic. You can override this behavior by explicitly adding a network rule collection with deny rules that match the translated traffic. To learn more about Azure Firewall rule processing logic, see [Azure Firewall rule processing logic](rule-processing.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.



## Create a resource group

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the Azure portal home page, select **Resource groups**, then select **Add**.
3. For **Resource group name**, type **RG-DNAT-Test**.
4. For **Subscription**, select your subscription.
5. For **Resource group location**, select a location. All subsequent resources that you create must be in the same location.
6. Select **Create**.

## Set up the network environment

For this tutorial, you create a two peered VNets:

- **VN-Hub** - the firewall is in this VNet.
- **VN-Spoke** - the workload server is in this VNet.

First, create the VNets and then peer them.

### Create the Hub VNet

1. From the Azure portal home page, select **All services**.
2. Under **Networking**, select **Virtual networks**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. For **Name**, type **VN-Hub**.
5. For **Address space**, type **10.0.0.0/16**.
6. For **Subscription**, select your subscription.
7. For **Resource group**, select **Use existing**, and then select **RG-DNAT-Test**.
8. For **Location**, select the same location that you used previously.
9. Under **Subnet**, for **Name** type **AzureFirewallSubnet**.

     The firewall will be in this subnet, and the subnet name **must** be AzureFirewallSubnet.
     > [!NOTE]
     > The size of the AzureFirewallSubnet subnet is /26. For more information about the subnet size, see [Azure Firewall FAQ](firewall-faq.md#why-does-azure-firewall-need-a-26-subnet-size).

10. For **Address range**, type **10.0.1.0/26**.
11. Use the other default settings, and then select **Create**.

### Create a spoke VNet

1. From the Azure portal home page, select **All services**.
2. Under **Networking**, select **Virtual networks**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. For **Name**, type **VN-Spoke**.
5. For **Address space**, type **192.168.0.0/16**.
6. For **Subscription**, select your subscription.
7. For **Resource group**, select **Use existing**, and then select **RG-DNAT-Test**.
8. For **Location**, select the same location that you used previously.
9. Under **Subnet**, for **Name** type **SN-Workload**.

    The server will be in this subnet.
10. For **Address range**, type **192.168.1.0/24**.
11. Use the other default settings, and then select **Create**.

### Peer the VNets

Now peer the two VNets.

1. Select the **VN-Hub** virtual network.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Peerings**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Type **Peer-HubSpoke** for the **Name of the peering from VN-Hub to VN-Spoke**.
5. Select **VN-Spoke** for the virtual network.
6. Type **Peer-SpokeHub** for **Name of peering from VN-Spoke to VN-Hub**.
7. For **Allow forwarded traffic from VN-Spoke to VN-Hub** select **Enabled**.
8. Select **OK**.

## Create a virtual machine

Create a workload virtual machine, and place it in the **SN-Workload** subnet.

1. From the Azure portal menu, select **Create a resource**.
2. Under **Popular**, select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**.

**Basics**

1. For **Subscription**, select your subscription.
1. For **Resource group**, select **Use existing**, and then select **RG-DNAT-Test**.
1. For **Virtual machine name**, type **Srv-Workload**.
1. For **Region**, select the same location that you used previously.
1. Type a username and password.
1. Select **Next: Disks**.

**Disks**
1. Select **Next: Networking**.

**Networking**

1. For **Virtual network**, select **VN-Spoke**.
2. For **Subnet**, select **SN-Workload**.
3. For **Public IP address** select **None**.
4. For **Public inbound ports**, select **None**. 
2. Leave the other default settings and select **Next : Management**.

**Management**

1. For **Boot diagnostics**, select **Off**.
1. Select **Review + Create**.

**Review + Create**

Review the summary, and then select **Create**. This will take a few minutes to complete.

After deployment finishes, note the private IP address for the virtual machine. It will be used later when you configure the firewall. Select the virtual machine name, and under **Settings**, select **Networking** to find the private IP address.

## Deploy the firewall

1. From the portal home page, select **Create a resource**.
2. Select **Networking**, and after **Featured**, select **See all**.
3. Select **Firewall**, and then select **Create**. 
4. On the **Create a Firewall** page, use the following table to configure the firewall:

   |Setting  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Name     |FW-DNAT-test|
   |Subscription     |\<your subscription\>|
   |Resource group     |**Use existing**: RG-DNAT-Test |
   |Location     |Select the same location that you used previously|
   |Choose a virtual network     |**Use existing**: VN-Hub|
   |Public IP address     |**Create new**. The Public IP address must be the Standard SKU type.|

5. Select **Review + create**.
6. Review the summary, and then select **Create** to create the firewall.

   This will take a few minutes to deploy.
7. After deployment completes, go to the **RG-DNAT-Test** resource group, and select the **FW-DNAT-test** firewall.
8. Note the private IP address. You'll use it later when you create the default route.

## Create a default route

For the **SN-Workload** subnet, you configure the outbound default route to go through the firewall.

1. From the Azure portal home page, select **All services**.
2. Under **Networking**, select **Route tables**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. For **Name**, type **RT-FWroute**.
5. For **Subscription**, select your subscription.
6. For **Resource group**, select **Use existing**, and select **RG-DNAT-Test**.
7. For **Location**, select the same location that you used previously.
8. Select **Create**.
9. Select **Refresh**, and then select the **RT-FWroute** route table.
10. Select **Subnets**, and then select **Associate**.
11. Select **Virtual network**, and then select **VN-Spoke**.
12. For **Subnet**, select **SN-Workload**.
13. Select **OK**.
14. Select **Routes**, and then select **Add**.
15. For **Route name**, type **FW-DG**.
16. For **Address prefix**, type **0.0.0.0/0**.
17. For **Next hop type**, select **Virtual appliance**.

    Azure Firewall is actually a managed service, but virtual appliance works in this situation.
18. For **Next hop address**, type the private IP address for the firewall that you noted previously.
19. Select **OK**.

## Configure a NAT rule

1. Open the **RG-DNAT-Test**, and select the **FW-DNAT-test** firewall. 
2. On the **FW-DNAT-test** page, under **Settings**, select **Rules**. 
3. Select **Add NAT rule collection**. 
4. For **Name**, type **RC-DNAT-01**. 
5. For **Priority**, type **200**. 
6. Under **Rules**, for **Name**, type **RL-01**.
7. For **Protocol**, select **TCP**.
8. For **Source Addresses**, type *. 
9. For **Destination Addresses** type the firewall's public IP address. 
10. For **Destination ports**, type **3389**. 
11. For **Translated Address** type the private IP address for the Srv-Workload virtual machine. 
12. For **Translated port**, type **3389**. 
13. Select **Add**. 

## Test the firewall

1. Connect a remote desktop to firewall public IP address. You should be connected to the **Srv-Workload** virtual machine.
2. Close the remote desktop.

## Clean up resources

You can keep your firewall resources for the next tutorial, or if no longer needed, delete the **RG-DNAT-Test** resource group to delete all firewall-related resources.
