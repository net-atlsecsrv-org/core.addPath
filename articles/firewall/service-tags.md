# Azure Firewall service tags

A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation. You cannot create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

Azure Firewall service tags can be used in the network rules destination field. You can use them in place of specific IP addresses.

## Supported service tags

See [Virtual network service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#available-service-tags) for a list of service tags that are available for use in Azure firewall network rules.

## Next steps
