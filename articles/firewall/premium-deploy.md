# Deploy and configure Azure Firewall Premium Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Firewall Premium is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

 Azure Firewall Premium Preview is a next generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS inspection** - decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS** - A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering** - extends Azure Firewallâ€™s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories** - administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.

For more information, see [Azure Firewall Premium features](premium-features.md).

You'll use a template to deploy a test environment that has a central VNet (10.0.0.0/16) with three subnets:
- a worker subnet (10.0.10.0/24)
- an Azure Bastion subnet (10.0.20.0/24)
- a firewall subnet (10.0.100.0/24)

A single central VNet is used in this test environment for simplicity. For production purposes, a [hub and spoke topology](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) with peered VNets is more common.

The worker virtual machine is a client that sends HTTP/S requests through the firewall.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Deploy the infrastructure

The template deploys a complete testing environment for Azure Firewall Premium enabled with IDPS, TLS Inspection, URL Filtering and Web Categories:

- a new Azure Firewall Premium and Firewall Policy with predefined settings to allow easy validation of its core capabilities (IDPS, TLS Inspection, URL Filtering and Web Categories)
- deploys all dependencies including Key Vault and a Managed Identity. In a production environment these resources may already be created and not needed in the same template.
- generates self signed Root CA and deploys it on the generated Key Vault
-  generates a derived Intermediate CA and deploys it on a Windows test virtual machine (WorkerVM)
- a Bastion Host (BastionHost) is also deployed and can be used to connect to the Windows testing machine (WorkerVM)

## Test the firewall

Now you can test IDPS, TLS inspection, Web filtering, and Web categories.

### Add firewall diagnostics settings

To collect firewall logs, you need to add diagnostics settings to collect firewall logs.

1. Select the **DemoFirewall** and under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings**.
2. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.
3. For **Diagnostic setting name**, type *fw-diag*.
4. Under **log**, select **AzureFirewallApplicationRule**, and **AzureFirewallNetworkRule**.
5. Under **Destination details**, select **Send to Log Analytics workspace**.
6. Select **Save**.

### IDPS tests

To test IDPS, you'll need to deploy your own internal Web server with an appropriate server certificate. For more information about Azure Firewall Premium Preview certificate requirements, see [Azure Firewall Premium Preview certificates](premium-certificates.md).

You can use `curl` to control various HTTP headers and simulate malicious traffic.

#### To test IDPS for HTTP traffic:

1. On the WorkerVM virtual machine, open an administrator command prompt window.
2. Type the following command at the command prompt:

   `curl -A "BlackSun" <your web server address>`
3. You'll see your Web server response.
4. Go to the Firewall Network rule logs on the Azure portal to find an alert similar to the following message:

   :::image type="content" source="media/premium-deploy/alert-message.png" alt-text="Alert message":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > It can take some time for the data to begin showing in the logs. Give it at least 20 minutes to allow for the logs to begin showing the data.
5. Add a signature rule for signature 2008983:

   1. Select the **DemoFirewallPolicy** and under **Settings** select **IDPS(preview)**.
   1. Select the **Signature rules** tab.
   1. Under **Signature ID**, in the open text box type *2008983*.
   1. Under **Mode**, select **Deny**.
   1. Select **Save**.
   1. Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding.



6. On WorkerVM, run the `curl` command again:

   `curl -A "BlackSun" <your web server address>`

   Since the HTTP request is now blocked by the firewall, you'll see the following output after the connection timeout expires:

   `read tcp 10.0.100.5:55734->10.0.20.10:80: read: connection reset by peer`

7. Go to the Monitor logs in the Azure portal and find the message for the blocked request.
<!---8. Now you can bypass the IDPS function using the **Bypass list**.

   1. On the **IDPS (preview)** page, select the **Bypass list** tab.
   2. Edit **MyRule** and set **Destination** to *10.0.20.10, which is the ServerVM private IP address.
   3. Select **Save**.
1. Run the test again: `curl -A "BlackSun" http://server.2020-private-preview.com` and now you should get the `Hello World` response and no log alert. --->

#### To test IDPS for HTTPS traffic

Repeat these curl tests using HTTPS instead of HTTP. For example:

`curl --ssl-no-revoke -A "BlackSun" <your web server address>`

You should see the same results that you had with the HTTP tests.

### TLS Inspection with URL filtering

Use the following steps to test TLS Inspection with URL filtering.

1. Edit the firewall policy application rules and add a new rule called `AllowURL` to the `AllowWeb` rule collection. Configure the target URL `www.nytimes.com/section/world`, Source IP address **\***, Destination type **URL (preview)**, select **TLS inspection (preview)**, and protocols **http, https**.

3. When the deployment completes, open a browser on WorkerVM and go to `https://www.nytimes.com/section/world` and validate that the HTML response is displayed as expected in the browser.
4. In the Azure portal, you can view the entire URL in the Application rule Monitoring logs:

      :::image type="content" source="media/premium-deploy/alert-message-url.png" alt-text="Alert message showing the URL":::

Some HTML pages may look incomplete because they refer to other URLs that are denied. To solve this issue, the following approach can be taken:

- If the HTML page contain links to other domains, you can add these domains to a new application rule with allow access to these FQDNs.
- If the HTML page contain links to sub URLs then you can modify the rule and add an asterisk to the URL. For example: `targetURLs=www.nytimes.com/section/world*`

   Alternatively, you can add a new URL to the rule. For example: 

   `www.nytimes.com/section/world, www.nytimes.com/section/world/*`

### Web categories testing

Let's create an application rule to allow access to sports web sites.
1. From the portal, open your resource group and select **DemoFirewallPolicy**.
2. Select **Application Rules**, and then **Add a rule collection**.
3. For **Name**, type *GeneralWeb*, **Priority** *103*, **Rule collection group** select **DefaultApplicationRuleCollectionGroup**.
4. Under **Rules** for **Name** type *AllowSports*, **Source** *\**, **Protocol** *http, https*, select **TLS inspection**, **Destination Type** select *Web categories (preview)*, **Destination** select *Sports*.
5. Select **Add**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/premium-deploy/web-categories.png" alt-text="Sports web category":::
6. When the deployment completes, go to  **WorkerVM** and open a web browser and browse to `https://www.nfl.com`.

   You should see the NFL web page, and the Application rule log shows that a **Web Category: Sports** rule was matched and the request was allowed.
