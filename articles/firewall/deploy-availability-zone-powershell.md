# Deploy an Azure Firewall with Availability Zones using Azure PowerShell

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Firewall with Availability Zones is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Firewall can be configured during deployment to span multiple Availability Zones for increased availability.

This feature enables the following scenarios:

- You can increase availability to 99.99% uptime. For more information, see the Azure Firewall [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/azure-firewall/v1_0/). The 99.99% uptime SLA is offered when two or more Availability Zones are selected.
- You can also associate Azure Firewall to a specific zone just for proximity reasons, using the service standard 99.95% SLA.

For more information about Azure Firewall Availability Zones, see [What is Azure Firewall?](overview.md)

The following Azure PowerShell example shows how you can deploy an Azure Firewall with Availability Zones.

## Create a firewall with Availability Zones

This example creates a firewall in zones 1, 2, and 3.

When the standard public IP address is created, no specific zone is specified. This creates a zone-redundant IP address by default. Standard public IP addresses can be configured either in all zones, or a single zone.

It's important to know, because you can't have a firewall in zone 1 and an IP address in zone 2. But you can have a firewall in zone 1 and IP address in all zones, or a firewall and an IP address in the same single zone for proximity purposes.

```azurepowershell
$rgName = "resourceGroupName"

$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -Name "vnet" `
  -ResourceGroupName $rgName

$pip1 = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -Name "AzFwPublicIp1" `
  -ResourceGroupName "rg" `
  -Sku "Standard" `
  -Location "centralus" `
  -AllocationMethod Static

New-AzFirewall `
  -Name "azFw" `
  -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
  -Location centralus `
  -VirtualNetwork $vnet `
  -PublicIpAddress @($pip1)
  -Zone 1,2,3
```
