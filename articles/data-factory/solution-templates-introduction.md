# Templates

Templates are predefined Azure Data Factory pipelines that allow you to get started quickly with Data Factory. Templates are useful when you're new to Data Factory and want to get started quickly. These templates reduce the development time for building data integration projects thereby improving developer productivity.

## Create Data Factory pipelines from templates

You can get started creating a Data Factory pipeline from a template in the following two ways:

1.  Select **Create pipeline from template** on the Overview page to open the template gallery.

### Out of the box Data Factory templates

Data Factory uses Azure Resource Manager templates for saving data factory pipeline templates. You can see all the Resource Manager templates, along with the manifest file used for out of the box Data Factory templates, in the [official Azure Data Factory GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-DataFactory/tree/master/templates). The predefined templates provided by Microsoft include but are not limited to the following items:

    -   [Delta copy from Database](solution-template-delta-copy-with-control-table.md)
