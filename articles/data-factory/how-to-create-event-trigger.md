# Create a trigger that runs a pipeline in response to a storage event

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article describes the Storage Event Triggers that you can create in your Data Factory pipelines.

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a common data integration pattern that involves production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. Data integration scenarios often require Data Factory customers to trigger pipelines based on events happening in storage account, such as the arrival or deletion of a file in Azure Blob Storage account. Data Factory natively integrates with [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/), which lets you trigger pipelines on such events.

For a ten-minute introduction and demonstration of this feature, watch the following video:

> [!NOTE]
> The integration described in this article depends on [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/). Make sure that your subscription is registered with the Event Grid resource provider. For more info, see [Resource providers and types](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-portal). You must be able to do the *Microsoft.EventGrid/eventSubscriptions/** action. This action is part of the EventGrid EventSubscription Contributor built-in role.

## Data Factory UI

This section shows you how to create a storage event trigger within the Azure Data Factory User Interface.

1. Switch to the **Edit** tab, shown with a pencil symbol.

1. Select **Trigger** on the menu, then select **New/Edit**.

1. On the **Add Triggers** page, select **Choose trigger...**, then select **+New**.

1. Select trigger type **Storage Event**

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-event-trigger/event-based-trigger-image1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Author page to create a new storage event trigger in Data Factory UI.":::

1. Select your storage account from the Azure subscription dropdown or manually using its Storage account resource ID. Choose which container you wish the events to occur on. Container selection is required, but be mindful that selecting all containers can lead to a large number of events.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Storage Event Trigger currently supports only Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and General-purpose version 2 storage accounts. Due to an Azure Event Grid limitation, Azure Data Factory only supports a maximum of 500 storage event triggers per storage account. If you hit the limit, please contact support for recommendations and increasing the limit upon evaluation by Event Grid team. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > To create a new or modify an existing Storage Event Trigger, the Azure account used to log into Data Factory and publish the storage event trigger must have appropriate role based access control (Azure RBAC) permission on the storage account. No additional permission is required: Service Principal for the Azure Data Factory does _not_ need special permission to either the Storage account or Event Grid. For more information about access control, see [Role based access control](#role-based-access-control) section.

1. The **Blob path begins with** and **Blob path ends with** properties allow you to specify the containers, folders, and blob names for which you want to receive events. Your storage event trigger requires at least one of these properties to be defined. You can use variety of patterns for both **Blob path begins with** and **Blob path ends with** properties, as shown in the examples later in this article.

    * **Blob path begins with:** The blob path must start with a folder path. Valid values include `2018/` and `2018/april/shoes.csv`. This field can't be selected if a container isn't selected.
    * **Blob path ends with:** The blob path must end with a file name or extension. Valid values include `shoes.csv` and `.csv`. Container and folder names, when specified, they must be separated by a `/blobs/` segment. For example, a container named 'orders' can have a value of `/orders/blobs/2018/april/shoes.csv`. To specify a folder in any container, omit the leading '/' character. For example, `april/shoes.csv` will trigger an event on any file named `shoes.csv` in folder a called 'april' in any container.
    * Note that Blob path **begins with** and **ends with** are the only pattern matching allowed in Storage Event Trigger. Other types of wildcard matching aren't supported for the trigger type.

1. Select whether your trigger will respond to a **Blob created** event, **Blob deleted** event, or both. In your specified storage location, each event will trigger the Data Factory pipelines associated with the trigger.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-event-trigger/event-based-trigger-image2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage event trigger creation page.":::

1. Select whether or not your trigger ignores blobs with zero bytes.

1. After you configure you trigger, click on **Next: Data preview**. This screen shows the existing blobs matched by your storage event trigger configuration. Make sure you've specific filters. Configuring filters that are too broad can match a large number of files created/deleted and may significantly impact your cost. Once your filter conditions have been verified, click **Finish**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-event-trigger/event-based-trigger-image3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage event trigger preview page.":::

1. To attach a pipeline to this trigger, go to the pipeline canvas and click **Trigger** and select **New/Edit**. When the side nav appears, click on the **Choose trigger...** dropdown and select the trigger you created. Click **Next: Data preview** to confirm the configuration is correct and then **Next** to validate the Data preview is correct.

1. If your pipeline has parameters, you can specify them on the trigger runs parameter side nav. The storage event trigger captures the folder path and file name of the blob into the properties `@triggerBody().folderPath` and `@triggerBody().fileName`. To use the values of these properties in a pipeline, you must map the properties to pipeline parameters. After mapping the properties to parameters, you can access the values captured by the trigger through the `@pipeline().parameters.parameterName` expression throughout the pipeline. For detailed explanation, see [Reference Trigger Metadata in Pipelines](how-to-use-trigger-parameterization.md)

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-event-trigger/event-based-trigger-image4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage event trigger mapping properties to pipeline parameters.":::

   In the preceding example, the trigger is configured to fire when a blob path ending in .csv is created in the folder _event-testing_ in the container _sample-data_. The **folderPath** and **fileName** properties capture the location of the new blob. For example, when MoviesDB.csv is added to the path sample-data/event-testing, `@triggerBody().folderPath` has a value of `sample-data/event-testing` and `@triggerBody().fileName` has a value of `moviesDB.csv`. These values are mapped, in the example, to the pipeline parameters `sourceFolder` and `sourceFile`, which can be used throughout the pipeline as `@pipeline().parameters.sourceFolder` and `@pipeline().parameters.sourceFile` respectively.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are creating your pipeline and trigger in [Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/overview-what-is.md), you must use `@trigger().outputs.body.fileName` and `@trigger().outputs.body.folderPath` as parameters. Those two properties capture blob information. Use those properties instead of using `@triggerBody().fileName` and `@triggerBody().folderPath`.

1. Click **Finish** once you are done.

## JSON schema

The following table provides an overview of the schema elements that are related to storage event triggers:

| **JSON Element** | **Description** | **Type** | **Allowed Values** | **Required** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **scope** | The Azure Resource Manager resource ID of the Storage Account. | String | Azure Resource Manager ID | Yes |
| **events** | The type of events that cause this trigger to fire. | Array    | Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated, Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted | Yes, any combination of these values. |
| **blobPathBeginsWith** | The blob path must begin with the pattern provided for the trigger to fire. For example, `/records/blobs/december/` only fires the trigger for blobs in the `december` folder under the `records` container. | String   | | Provide a value for at least one of these properties: `blobPathBeginsWith` or `blobPathEndsWith`. |
| **blobPathEndsWith** | The blob path must end with the pattern provided for the trigger to fire. For example, `december/boxes.csv` only fires the trigger for blobs named `boxes` in a `december` folder. | String   | | You have to provide a value for at least one of these properties: `blobPathBeginsWith` or `blobPathEndsWith`. |
| **ignoreEmptyBlobs** | Whether or not zero-byte blobs will trigger a pipeline run. By default, this is set to true. | Boolean | true or false | No |

## Examples of storage event triggers

This section provides examples of storage event trigger settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to include the `/blobs/` segment of the path, as shown in the following examples, whenever you specify container and folder, container and file, or container, folder, and file. For **blobPathBeginsWith**, the Data Factory UI will automatically add `/blobs/` between the folder and container name in the trigger JSON.

| Property | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Blob path begins with** | `/containername/` | Receives events for any blob in the container. |
| **Blob path begins with** | `/containername/blobs/foldername/` | Receives events for any blobs in the `containername` container and `foldername` folder. |
| **Blob path begins with** | `/containername/blobs/foldername/subfoldername/` | You can also reference a subfolder. |
| **Blob path begins with** | `/containername/blobs/foldername/file.txt` | Receives events for a blob named `file.txt` in the `foldername` folder under the `containername` container. |
| **Blob path ends with** | `file.txt` | Receives events for a blob named `file.txt` in any path. |
| **Blob path ends with** | `/containername/blobs/file.txt` | Receives events for a blob named `file.txt` under container `containername`. |
| **Blob path ends with** | `foldername/file.txt` | Receives events for a blob named `file.txt` in `foldername` folder under any container. |

## Role-based access control

Azure Data Factory uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to ensure that unauthorized access to listen to, subscribe to updates from, and trigger pipelines linked to blob events, are strictly prohibited.

* To successfully create a new or update an existing Storage Event Trigger, the Azure account signed into the Data Factory needs to have appropriate access to the relevant storage account. Otherwise, the operation with fail with _Access Denied_.
* Data Factory needs no special permission to your Event Grid, and you do _not_ need to assign special RBAC permission to Data Factory service principal for the operation.

Any of following RBAC settings works for storage event trigger:

* Owner role to the storage account
* Contributor role to the storage account
* _Microsoft.EventGrid/EventSubscriptions/Write_ permission to storage account _/subscriptions/####/resourceGroups/####/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageAccountName_

In order to understand how Azure Data Factory delivers the two promises, let's take back a step and take a sneak peek behind the scene. Here are the high-level work flows for integration among Data Factory, Storage, and Event Grid.

### Create a new Storage Event Trigger

This high-level work flow describes how Azure Data Factory interacts with Event Grid to create a Storage Event Trigger

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-event-trigger/storage-event-trigger-5-create-subscription.png" alt-text="Workflow of storage event trigger creation.":::

Two noticeable call outs from the work flows:

* Azure Data Factory makes _no_ direct contact with Storage account. Request to create a subscription is instead relayed and processed by Event Grid. Hence, Data Factory needs no permission to Storage account for this step.

* Access control and permission checking happen on Azure Data Factory side. Before ADF sends a request to subscribe to storage event, it checks the permission for the user. More specifically, it checks whether the Azure account signed in and attempting to create the Storage Event trigger has appropriate access to the relevant storage account. If the permission check fails, trigger creation also fails.

### Storage event trigger Data Factory pipeline run

This high-level work flows describe how Storage event triggers pipeline run through Event Grid

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-event-trigger/storage-event-trigger-6-trigger-pipeline.png" alt-text="Workflow of storage event triggering pipeline runs.":::

When it comes to Event triggering pipeline in Data Factory, three noticeable call outs in the workflow:

* Event Grid uses a Push model that it relays the message as soon as possible when storage drops the message into the system. This is different from messaging system, such as Kafka where a Pull system is used.
* Event Trigger on Azure Data Factory serves as an active listener to the incoming message and it properly triggers the associated pipeline.
* Storage Event Trigger itself makes no direct contact with Storage account

  * That said, if you have a Copy or other activity inside the pipeline to process the data in Storage account, Data Factory will make direct contact with Storage, using the credentials stored in the Linked Service. Ensure that Linked Service is set up appropriately
  * However, if you make no reference to the Storage account in the pipeline, you do not need to grant permission to Data Factory to access Storage account
