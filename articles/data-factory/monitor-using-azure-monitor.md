# Alert and monitor data factories by using Azure Monitor

Cloud applications are complex and have many moving parts. Monitors provide data to help ensure that your applications stay up and running in a healthy state. Monitors also help you avoid potential problems and troubleshoot past ones.

You can use monitoring data to gain deep insights about your applications. This knowledge helps you improve application performance and maintainability. It also helps you automate actions that otherwise require manual intervention.

Azure Monitor provides base-level infrastructure metrics and logs for most Azure services. Azure diagnostic logs are emitted by a resource and provide rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. And Azure Data Factory writes diagnostic logs in Monitor.

For details, see [Azure Monitor overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-azure-monitor).

## Keeping Azure Data Factory data

Data Factory stores pipeline-run data for only 45 days. Use Monitor if you want to keep that data for a longer time. With Monitor, you can route diagnostic logs for analysis. You can also keep them in a storage account so that you have factory information for your chosen duration.

## Diagnostic logs

* Save your diagnostic logs to a storage account for auditing or manual inspection. You can use the diagnostic settings to specify the retention time in days.
* Stream the logs to Azure Event Hubs. The logs become input to a partner service or to a custom analytics solution like Power BI.
* Analyze the logs with Log Analytics.

You can use a storage account or event-hub namespace that isn't in the subscription of the resource that emits logs. The user who configures the setting must have appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) access to both subscriptions.

## Set up diagnostic logs

### Diagnostic settings

Use diagnostic settings to configure diagnostic logs for noncompute resources. The settings for a resource control have the following features:

* They specify where diagnostic logs are sent. Examples include an Azure storage account, an Azure event hub, or Monitor logs.
* They specify which log categories are sent.
* They specify how long each log category should be kept in a storage account.
* A retention of zero days means logs are kept forever. Otherwise, the value can be any number of days from 1 through 2,147,483,647.
* If retention policies are set but storing logs in a storage account is disabled, the retention policies have no effect. For example, this condition can happen when only Event Hubs or Monitor logs options are selected.
* Retention policies are applied per day. The boundary between days occurs at midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). At the end of a day, logs from days that are beyond the retention policy are deleted. For example, if you have a retention policy of one day, at the beginning of today the logs from before yesterday are deleted.

### Enable diagnostic logs via the Azure Monitor REST API

#### Create or update a diagnostics setting in the Monitor REST API

##### Request

```
PUT
https://management.azure.com/{resource-id}/providers/microsoft.insights/diagnosticSettings/service?api-version={api-version}
```

##### Headers

* Replace `{api-version}` with `2016-09-01`.
* Replace `{resource-id}` with the ID of the resource for which you want to edit diagnostic settings. For more information, see [Using Resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/manage-resource-groups-portal.md).
* Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
* Set the authorization header to the JSON web token that you got from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). For more information, see [Authenticating requests](../active-directory/develop/authentication-scenarios.md).

* The first letter in each column name is capitalized. For example, the column name "correlationId" in Monitor is "CorrelationId" in Log Analytics.
* There's no "Level" column.
* The dynamic "properties" column is preserved as the following dynamic JSON blob type.

    | Azure Monitor column | Log Analytics column | Type |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | $.properties.UserProperties | UserProperties | Dynamic |

## Metrics

With Monitor, you can gain visibility into the performance and health of your Azure workloads. The most important type of Monitor data is the metric, which is also called the performance counter. Metrics are emitted by most Azure resources. Monitor provides several ways to configure and consume these metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting.

Azure Data Factory version 2 emits the following metrics.

| **Metric**           | **Metric display name**         | **Unit** | **Aggregation type** | **Description**                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| PipelineSucceededRuns | Succeeded pipeline runs metrics | Count    | Total                | The total number of pipeline runs that succeeded within a minute window. |
| PipelineFailedRuns   | Failed pipeline runs metrics    | Count    | Total                | The total number of pipeline runs that failed within a minute window.    |
| ActivitySucceededRuns | Succeeded activity runs metrics | Count    | Total                | The total number of activity runs that succeeded within a minute window.  |
| ActivityFailedRuns   | Failed activity runs metrics    | Count    | Total                | The total number of activity runs that failed within a minute window.     |
| TriggerSucceededRuns | Succeeded trigger runs metrics  | Count    | Total                | The total number of trigger runs that succeeded within a minute window.   |
| TriggerFailedRuns    | Failed trigger runs metrics     | Count    | Total                | The total number of trigger runs that failed within a minute window.      |

To access the metrics, complete the instructions in [Azure Monitor data platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics).

## Monitor Data Factory metrics with Azure Monitor

You can use Data Factory integration with Monitor to route data to Monitor. This integration is useful in the following scenarios:

* You want to write complex queries on a rich set of metrics that is published by Data Factory to Monitor. You can create custom alerts on these queries via Monitor.

* You want to monitor across data factories. You can route data from multiple data factories to a single Monitor workspace.

For a seven-minute introduction and demonstration of this feature, watch the following video:

### Configure diagnostic settings and workspace

Create or add diagnostic settings for your data factory.

1. In the portal, go to Monitor. Select **Settings** > **Diagnostic settings**.

1. Select the data factory for which you want to set a diagnostic setting.

1. If no settings exist on the selected data factory, you're prompted to create a setting. Select **Turn on diagnostics**.

   ![Create a diagnostic setting if no settings exist](media/data-factory-monitor-oms/monitor-oms-image1.png)

   If there are existing settings on the data factory, you see a list of settings already configured on the data factory. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.

   ![Add a diagnostic setting if settings exist](media/data-factory-monitor-oms/add-diagnostic-setting.png)

1. Give your setting a name, select **Send to Log Analytics**, and then select a workspace from **Log Analytics Workspace**.

    ![Name your settings and select a log-analytics workspace](media/data-factory-monitor-oms/monitor-oms-image2.png)

1. Select **Save**.

After a few moments, the new setting appears in your list of settings for this data factory. Diagnostic logs are streamed to that workspace as soon as new event data is generated. Up to 15 minutes might elapse between when an event is emitted and when it appears in Log Analytics.

* In _Resource-Specific_ mode, diagnostic logs from Azure Data Factory flow into _ADFPipelineRun_, _ADFTriggerRun_, and _ADFActivityRun_ tables
* In _Azure-Diagnostics_ mode, diagnostic logs flow into _AzureDiagnostics_ table

> [!NOTE]
> Because an Azure log table can't have more than 500 columns, we highly recommended you select Resource-Specific mode. For more information, see [Log Analytics Known Limitations](../azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-collect-workspace.md#column-limit-in-azurediagnostics).
