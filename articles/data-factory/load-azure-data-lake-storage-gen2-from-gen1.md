# Copy data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Gen2 with Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is a set of capabilities dedicated to big data analytics that's built into [Azure Blob storage](../storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction.md). You can use it to interface with your data by using both file system and object storage paradigms.

If you currently use Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, you can evaluate Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 by copying data from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Gen2 by using Azure Data Factory.

Azure Data Factory is a fully managed cloud-based data integration service. You can use the service to populate the lake with data from a rich set of on-premises and cloud-based data stores and save time when you build your analytics solutions. For a list of supported connectors, see the table of [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats).

Azure Data Factory offers a scale-out, managed data movement solution. Because of the scale-out architecture of Data Factory, it can ingest data at a high throughput. For more information, see [Copy activity performance](copy-activity-performance.md).

This article shows you how to use the Data Factory copy data tool to copy data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. You can follow similar steps to copy data from other types of data stores.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 account with data in it.
* Azure Storage account with Data Lake Storage Gen2 enabled. If you don't have a Storage account, [create an account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount-ARM).

## Create a data factory

1. On the left menu, select **Create a resource** > **Data + Analytics** > **Data Factory**.

## Best practices

To assess upgrading from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in general, see [Upgrade your big data analytics solutions from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-migrate-gen1-to-gen2.md). The following sections introduce best practices for using Data Factory for a data upgrade from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Data Lake Storage Gen2.

### Data partition for historical data copy

- If your total data size in Data Lake Storage Gen1 is less than 30 TB and the number of files is less than 1 million, you can copy all data in a single copy activity run.
- If you have a larger amount of data to copy, or you want the flexibility to manage data migration in batches and make each of them complete within a specific time frame, partition the data. Partitioning also reduces the risk of any unexpected issue.

Use a proof of concept to verify the end-to-end solution and test the copy throughput in your environment. Major proof-of-concept steps: 

1. Create one Data Factory pipeline with a single copy activity to copy several TBs of data from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Data Lake Storage Gen2 to get a copy performance baseline. Start with [data integration units (DIUs)](copy-activity-performance-features.md#data-integration-units) as 128. 
2. Based on the copy throughput you get in step 1, calculate the estimated time that's required for the entire data migration. 
3. (Optional) Create a control table and define the file filter to partition the files to be migrated. The way to partition the files is to: 

    - Partition by folder name or folder name with a wildcard filter. We recommend this method.
    - Partition by a file's last modified time.

### Network bandwidth and storage I/O 

You can control the concurrency of Data Factory copy jobs that read data from Data Lake Storage Gen1 and write data to Data Lake Storage Gen2. In this way, you can manage the use on that storage I/O to avoid affecting the normal business work on Data Lake Storage Gen1 during the migration.

### Permissions 

In Data Factory, the [Data Lake Storage Gen1 connector](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md) supports service principal and managed identity for Azure resource authentications. The [Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md) supports account key, service principal, and managed identity for Azure resource authentications. To make Data Factory able to navigate and copy all the files or access control lists (ACLs) you need, grant high enough permissions for the account you provide to access, read, or write all files and set ACLs if you choose to. Grant it a super-user or owner role during the migration period. 

### Preserve ACLs from Data Lake Storage Gen1

If you want to replicate the ACLs along with data files when you upgrade from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Data Lake Storage Gen2, see [Preserve ACLs from Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md#preserve-acls). 

### Incremental copy 

You can use several approaches to load only the new or updated files from Data Lake Storage Gen1:

- Load new or updated files by time partitioned folder or file name. An example is /2019/05/13/*.
- Load new or updated files by LastModifiedDate.
- Identify new or updated files by any third-party tool or solution. Then pass the file or folder name to the Data Factory pipeline via parameter or a table or file. 

The proper frequency to do incremental load depends on the total number of files in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and the volume of new or updated files to be loaded every time.
