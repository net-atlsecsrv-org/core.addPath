# Copy data from Concur using Azure Data Factory (Preview)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Concur. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Concur to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

> [!NOTE]
> Partner account is currently not supported.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Concur connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Concur linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Concur** | Yes |
| clientId | Application client_id supplied by Concur App Management.  | Yes |
| username | The user name that you use to access Concur Service.  | Yes |
| password | The password corresponding to the user name that you provided in the username field. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "ConcurLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Concur",
        "typeProperties": {
            "clientId" : "<clientId>",
            "username" : "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Concur dataset.

To copy data from Concur, set the type property of the dataset to **ConcurObject**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **ConcurObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |


**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "ConcurDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "ConcurObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Concur linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Concur source.

### ConcurSource as source

To copy data from Concur, set the source type in the copy activity to **ConcurSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **ConcurSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Opportunities where Id = xxx "`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromConcur",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Concur input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "ConcurSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Opportunities where Id = xxx"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
