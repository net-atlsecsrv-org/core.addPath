# Visual authoring in Azure Data Factory
The Azure Data Factory user interface experience (UX) lets you visually author and deploy resources for your data factory without having to write any code. You can drag activities to a pipeline canvas, perform test runs, debug iteratively, and deploy and monitor your pipeline runs. There are two approaches for using the UX to perform visual authoring:

- Author directly with the Data Factory service.
- Author with Azure Repos Git integration for collaboration, source control, and versioning.

## Author directly with the Data Factory service
Visual authoring with the Data Factory service differs from visual authoring with Git integration in two ways:

- The Data Factory service doesn't include a repository for storing the JSON entities for your changes.
- The Data Factory service isn't optimized for collaboration or version control.

When you use the UX **Authoring canvas** to author directly with the Data Factory service, only the **Publish All** mode is available. Any changes that you make are published directly to the Data Factory service.

## Author with Azure Repos Git integration
Visual authoring with Azure Repos Git integration supports source control and collaboration for work on your data factory pipelines. You can associate a data factory with an Azure Repos Git organization repository for source control, collaboration, versioning, and so on. A single Azure Repos Git organization can have multiple repositories, but an Azure Repos Git repository can be associated with only one data factory. If you don't have an Azure Repos organization or repository, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization-msa-or-work-student) to create your resources.

> [!NOTE]
> You can store script and data files in an Azure Repos Git repository. However, you have to upload the files manually to Azure Storage. A Data Factory pipeline does not automatically upload script or data files stored in an Azure Repos Git repository to Azure Storage.

### Configure an Azure Repos Git repository with Azure Data Factory
You can configure an Azure Repos Git repository with a data factory through two methods.

#### <a name="method1"></a> Configuration method 1 (Azure Repos Git repo): Let's get started page

In Azure Data Factory, go to the **Let's get started** page. Select **Configure Code Repository**:

![Configure an Azure Repos code repository](media/author-visually/configure-repo.png)

The **Repository Settings** configuration pane appears:

![Configure the code repository settings](media/author-visually/repo-settings.png)

The pane shows the following Azure Repos code repository settings:

| Setting | Description | Value |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Repository Type** | The type of the Azure Repos code repository.<br/> | Azure Repos Git |
| **Azure Active Directory** | Your Azure AD tenant name. | `<your tenant name>` |
| **Azure Repos Organization** | Your Azure Repos organization name. You can locate your Azure Repos organization name at `https://{organization name}.visualstudio.com`. You can [sign in to your Azure Repos organization](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/git/) to access your Visual Studio profile and see your repositories and projects. | `<your organization name>` |
| **ProjectName** | Your Azure Repos project name. You can locate your Azure Repos project name at `https://{organization name}.visualstudio.com/{project name}`. | `<your Azure Repos project name>` |
| **RepositoryName** | Your Azure Repos code repository name. Azure Repos projects contain Git repositories to manage your source code as your project grows. You can create a new repository or use an existing repository that's already in your project. | `<your Azure Repos code repository name>` |
| **Collaboration branch** | Your Azure Repos collaboration branch that is used for publishing. By default, it is `master`. Change this setting in case you want to publish resources from another branch. | `<your collaboration branch name>` |
| **Root folder** | Your root folder in your Azure Repos collaboration branch. | `<your root folder name>` |
| **Import existing Data Factory resources to repository** | Specifies whether to import existing data factory resources from the UX **Authoring canvas** into an Azure Repos Git repository. Select the box to import your data factory resources into the associated Git repository in JSON format. This action exports each resource individually (that is, the linked services and datasets are exported into separate JSONs). When this box isn't selected, the existing resources aren't imported. | Selected (default) |

#### Configuration method 2 (Azure Repos Git repo): UX authoring canvas
In the Azure Data Factory UX **Authoring canvas**, locate your data factory. Select the **Data Factory** drop-down menu, and then select **Configure Code Repository**.

A configuration pane appears. For details about the configuration settings, see the descriptions in <a href="#method1">Configuration method 1</a>.

![Configure the code repository settings for UX authoring](media/author-visually/configure-repo-2.png)

### Use a different Azure Active Directory tenant

You can create an Azure Repos Git repo in a different Azure Active Directory tenant. To specify a different Azure AD tenant, you have to have administrator permissions for the Azure subscription that you're using.

### Use your personal Microsoft account

To use a personal Microsoft account for Git integration, you can link your personal Azure Repo to your organization's Active Directory.

1. Add your personal Microsoft account to your organization's Active Directory as a guest. For more info, see [Add Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration users in the Azure portal](../active-directory/b2b/add-users-administrator.md).

2. Log in to the Azure portal with your personal Microsoft account. Then switch to your organization's Active Directory.

3. Go to the Azure DevOps section, where you now see your personal repo. Select the repo and connect with Active Directory.

After these configuration steps, your personal repo is available when you set up Git integration in the Data Factory UI.

For more info about connecting Azure Repos to your organization's Active Directory, see [Connect your Azure DevOps organization to Azure Active Directory](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/connect-organization-to-azure-ad).

### Switch to a different Git repo

To switch to a different Git repo, locate the icon in the upper right corner of the Data Factory overview page, as shown in the following screenshot. If you canâ€™t see the icon, clear your local browser cache. Select the icon to remove the association with the current repo.

After you remove the association with the current repo, you can configure your Git settings to use a different repo. Then you can import existing Data Factory resources to the new repo.

![Remove the association with the current Git repo](media/author-visually/remove-repo.png)

### Use version control
Version control systems (also known as _source control_) let developers collaborate on code and track changes that are made to the code base. Source control is an essential tool for multi-developer projects.

Each Azure Repos Git repository that's associated with a data factory has a collaboration branch. (`master` is the default collaboration branch). Users can also create feature branches by clicking **+ New Branch** and do development in the feature branches.

![Change the code by syncing or publishing](media/author-visually/sync-publish.png)

When you are ready with the feature development in your feature branch, you can click **Create pull request**. This action takes you to Azure Repos Git where you can raise pull requests, do code reviews, and merge changes to your collaboration branch. (`master` is the default). You are only allowed to publish to the Data Factory service from your collaboration branch. 

![Create a new pull request](media/author-visually/create-pull-request.png)

### Configure publishing settings

To configure the publish branch - that is, the branch where Resource Manager templates are saved - add a `publish_config.json` file to the root folder in the collaboration branch. Data Factory reads this file, looks for the field `publishBranch`, and creates a new branch (if it doesn't already exist) with the value provided. Then it saves all Resource Manager templates to the specified location. For example:

```json
{
    "publishBranch": "factory/adf_publish"
}
```

When you publish from Git mode, you can confirm that Data Factory is using the publish branch that you expect, as shown in the following screenshot:

![Confirm the correct publish branch](media/author-visually/configure-publish-branch.png)

When you specify a new publish branch, Data Factory doesn't delete the previous publish branch. If you want to remote the previous publish branch, delete it manually.

Data Factory only reads the `publish_config.json` file when it loads the factory. If you already have the factory loaded in the portal, refresh the browser to make your changes take effect.

### Publish code changes
After you have merged changes to the collaboration branch (`master` is the default), select **Publish** to manually publish your code changes in the master branch to the Data Factory service.

![Publish changes to the Data Factory service](media/author-visually/publish-changes.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The master branch is not representative of what's deployed in the Data Factory service. The master branch *must* be published manually to the Data Factory service.

### Advantages of Git integration

-   **Source Control**. As your data factory workloads become crucial, you would want to integrate your factory with Git to leverage several source control benefits like the following:
    -   Ability to track/audit changes.
    -   Ability to revert changes that introduced bugs.
-   **Partial Saves**. As you make a lot of changes in your factory, you will realize that in the regular LIVE mode, you can't save your changes as draft, because you are not ready, or you donâ€™t want to lose your changes in case your computer crashes. With Git integration, you can continue saving your changes incrementally, and publish to the factory only when you are ready. Git acts as a staging place for your work, until you have tested your changes to your satisfaction.
-   **Collaboration and Control**. If you have multiple team members participating to the same factory, you may want to let your teammates collaborate with each other via a code review process. You can also set up your factory such that not every contributor to the factory has permission to deploy to the factory. Team members may just be allowed to make changes via Git, but only certain people in the team are allowed to "Publish" the changes to the factory.
-   **Showing diffs**. In Git mode, you get to see a nice diff of the payload thatâ€™s about to get published to the factory. This diff shows you all resources/entities that got modified/added/deleted since the last time you published to your factory. Based on this diff, you can either continue further with publishing, or go back and check your changes, and then come back later.
-   **Better CI/CD**. If you are using Git mode, you can configure your release pipeline to trigger automatically as soon as there are any changes made in the dev factory. You also get to customize the properties in your factory that are available as parameters in the Resource Manager template. It can be useful to keep only the required set of properties as parameters, and have everything else hard coded.
-   **Better Performance**. An average factory loads 10x times faster in Git mode than in regular LIVE mode, because the resources are downloaded via Git.

### Best practices for Git integration

-   **Permissions**. Typically you donâ€™t want all the team members to be having permissions to update the factory.
    -   All team members should have read permissions to the data factory.
    -   Only a select set of people should be allowed to publish to the factory, and for that they need to be part of the "Data Factory contributor" role on the factory.
    -   One of the good practices of the source control is also to not allow direct check-ins into the collaboration branch. This requirement prevents bugs as every check-in goes through a Pull Request process.
-   **Switching modes**.
    -    Once you are in Git mode, we donâ€™t recommend you to switch back and forth into LIVE mode, primarily because any changes that are made in LIVE mode, will not be seen when you switch back to Git. Try to make the changes in Git mode itself and then publish them via the UI.
    -   Similarly, donâ€™t use any Data factory powershell cmdlets either, as they achieve the same effect by directly applying the provided changes to the live factory.
-   **Use passwords from Azure Key Vault**.
    -   We strongly recommend using AzureKeyVault to store any connection strings or passwords to DataFactory Linked Services.
    -   We donâ€™t store any such secret information in Git (for security reasons), so any changes to Linked Services are right away published to the live factory. This immediate publishing is sometimes not desired, as the changes may not have gotten tested, which defeats the purpose of Git.
    -   As a result, all such secrets must be fetched from Linked Services that use Azure Key Vault based.
    -   Some of the other benefits of using Key Vault, is that it makes CICD easier, by not making you provide these secrets during Resource Manager template deployment.

## Author with GitHub integration

Visual authoring with GitHub integration supports source control and collaboration for work on your data factory pipelines. You can associate a data factory with a GitHub account repository for source control, collaboration, versioning. A single GitHub account can have multiple repositories, but a GitHub repository can be associated with only one data factory. If you don't have a GitHub account or repository, followÂ [these instructions](https://github.com/join)Â to create your resources.

The GitHub integration with Data Factory supports both public GitHub (that is, [https://github.com](https://github.com)) and GitHub Enterprise. You can use both public and private GitHub repositories with Data Factory as long you have read and write permission to the repository in GitHub.

To configure a GitHub repo, you have to have administrator permissions for the Azure subscription that you're using.

For a nine-minute introduction and demonstration of this feature, watch the following video:

> [!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/azure-friday/Azure-Data-Factory-visual-tools-now-integrated-with-GitHub/player]

### Limitations

- You can store script and data files in a GitHub repository. However, you have to upload the files manually to Azure Storage. A Data Factory pipeline does not automatically upload script or data files stored in a GitHub repository to Azure Storage.

- GitHub Enterprise with a version older than 2.14.0 doesn't work in the Microsoft Edge browser.

- GitHub integration with the Data Factor visual authoring tools only works in the generally available version of Data Factory.

### Configure a public GitHub repository with Azure Data Factory

You can configure a GitHub repository with a data factory through two methods.

**Configuration method 1 (public repo): Let's get started page**

In Azure Data Factory, go to theÂ **Let's get started**Â page. SelectÂ **Configure Code Repository**:
