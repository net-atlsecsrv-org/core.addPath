# Copy and transform data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) is a set of capabilities dedicated to big data analytics built into [Azure Blob storage](../storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction.md). You can use it to interface with your data by using both file system and object storage paradigms.

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from and to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and use Data Flow to transform data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. To learn about Azure Data Factory, read the [introductory article](introduction.md).

## Supported capabilities

This Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Mapping data flow](concepts-data-flow-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)
- [GetMetadata activity](control-flow-get-metadata-activity.md)
- [Delete activity](delete-activity.md)

For Copy activity, with this connector you can:

- Copy data from/to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 by using account key, service principal, or managed identities for Azure resources authentications.
- Copy files as-is or parse or generate files with [supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md).
- [Preserve file metadata during copy](#preserve-metadata-during-copy).
- [Preserve ACLs](#preserve-metadata-during-copy) when copying from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you enable the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account** option on Azure Storage firewall settings and want to use Azure integration runtime to connect to your Data Lake Storage Gen2, you must use [managed identity authentication](#managed-identity) for ADLS Gen2.

>[!TIP]
>If you enable the hierarchical namespace, currently there's no interoperability of operations between Blob and Data Lake Storage Gen2 APIs. If you hit the error "ErrorCode=FilesystemNotFound" with the message "The specified filesystem does not exist," it's caused by the specified sink file system that was created via the Blob API instead of Data Lake Storage Gen2 API elsewhere. To fix the issue, specify a new file system with a name that doesn't exist as the name of a Blob container. Then Data Factory automatically creates that file system during data copy.

## Get started

>[!TIP]
>For a walk-through of how to use the Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector, see [Load data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](load-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.md).

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide information about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Linked service properties

The Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector supports the following authentication types. See the corresponding sections for details:

- [Account key authentication](#account-key-authentication)
- [Service principal authentication](#service-principal-authentication)
- [Managed identities for Azure resources authentication](#managed-identity)

>[!NOTE]
>When using PolyBase to load data into SQL Data Warehouse, if your source Data Lake Storage Gen2 is configured with Virtual Network endpoint, you must use managed identity authentication as required by PolyBase. See the [managed identity authentication](#managed-identity) section with more configuration prerequisites.

### Account key authentication

To use storage account key authentication, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **AzureBlobFS**. |Yes |
| url | Endpoint for Data Lake Storage Gen2 with the pattern of `https://<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net`. | Yes |
| accountKey | Account key for Data Lake Storage Gen2. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use the Azure integration runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime if your data store is in a private network. If this property isn't specified, the default Azure integration runtime is used. |No |

>[!NOTE]
>Secondary ADLS file system endpoint is not supported when using account key authentication. You can use other authentication types.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStorageGen2LinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlobFS",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "https://<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net", 
            "accountkey": { 
                "type": "SecureString", 
                "value": "<accountkey>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

### Service principal authentication

To use service principal authentication, follow these steps.

1. Register an application entity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by following the steps in [Register your application with an Azure AD tenant](../storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app.md#register-your-application-with-an-azure-ad-tenant). Make note of the following values, which you use to define the linked service:

    - Application ID
    - Application key
    - Tenant ID

2. Grant the service principal proper permission. See examples on how permission works in Data Lake Storage Gen2 from [Access control lists on files and directories](../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control.md#access-control-lists-on-files-and-directories)

    - **As source**: In Storage Explorer, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders and the file system, along with **Read** permission for the files to copy. Alternatively, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role.
    - **As sink**: In Storage Explorer, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders and the file system, along with **Write** permission for the sink folder. Alternatively, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role.

>[!NOTE]
>If you use Data Factory UI to author and the service principal is not set with "Storage Blob Data Reader/Contributor" role in IAM, when doing test connection or browsing/navigating folders, choose "Test connection to file path" or "Browse from specified path", and specify a path with Read + Execute permission to continue. For now, test connection to a file system would fail, specify a sub-directory to test or skip this operation.

These properties are supported for the linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **AzureBlobFS**. |Yes |
| url | Endpoint for Data Lake Storage Gen2 with the pattern of `https://<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net`. | Yes |
| servicePrincipalId | Specify the application's client ID. | Yes |
| servicePrincipalKey | Specify the application's key. Mark this field as a `SecureString` to store it securely in Data Factory. Or, you can [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| tenant | Specify the tenant information (domain name or tenant ID) under which your application resides. Retrieve it by hovering the mouse in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use the Azure integration runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime if your data store is in a private network. If not specified, the default Azure integration runtime is used. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStorageGen2LinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlobFS",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "https://<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net", 
            "servicePrincipalId": "<service principal id>",
            "servicePrincipalKey": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<service principal key>"
            },
            "tenant": "<tenant info, e.g. microsoft.onmicrosoft.com>" 
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

### <a name="managed-identity"></a> Managed identities for Azure resources authentication

A data factory can be associated with a [managed identity for Azure resources](data-factory-service-identity.md), which represents this specific data factory. You can directly use this managed identity for Data Lake Storage Gen2 authentication, similar to using your own service principal. It allows this designated factory to access and copy data to or from your Data Lake Storage Gen2.

To use managed identities for Azure resource authentication, follow these steps.

1. [Retrieve the Data Factory managed identity information](data-factory-service-identity.md#retrieve-managed-identity) by copying the value of the **service identity application ID** generated along with your factory.

2. Grant the managed identity proper permission. See examples on how permission works in Data Lake Storage Gen2 from [Access control lists on files and directories](../storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control.md#access-control-lists-on-files-and-directories).

    - **As source**: In Storage Explorer, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders and the file system, along with **Read** permission for the files to copy. Alternatively, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role.
    - **As sink**: In Storage Explorer, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders and the file system, along with **Write** permission for the sink folder. Alternatively, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role.

>[!NOTE]
>If you use Data Factory UI to author and the managed identity is not set with "Storage Blob Data Reader/Contributor" role in IAM, when doing test connection or browsing/navigating folders, choose "Test connection to file path" or "Browse from specified path", and specify a path with Read + Execute permission to continue. For now, test connection to a file system would fail, specify a sub-directory to test or skip this operation.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you use PolyBase to load data from Data Lake Storage Gen2 into SQL Data Warehouse, when using  managed identity authentication for Data Lake Storage Gen2, make sure you also follow steps 1 and 2 in [this guidance](../sql-database/sql-database-vnet-service-endpoint-rule-overview.md#impact-of-using-vnet-service-endpoints-with-azure-storage) to 1) register your SQL Database server with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and 2) assign the Storage Blob Data Contributor role to your SQL Database server; the rest are handled by Data Factory. If your Data Lake Storage Gen2 is configured with an Azure Virtual Network endpoint, to use PolyBase to load data from it, you must use managed identity authentication as required by PolyBase.

These properties are supported for the linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **AzureBlobFS**. |Yes |
| url | Endpoint for Data Lake Storage Gen2 with the pattern of `https://<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net`. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use the Azure integration runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime if your data store is in a private network. If not specified, the default Azure integration runtime is used. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStorageGen2LinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlobFS",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "https://<accountname>.dfs.core.windows.net", 
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see [Copy activity configurations](copy-activity-overview.md#configuration) and [Pipelines and activities](concepts-pipelines-activities.md). This section provides a list of properties supported by the Data Lake Storage Gen2 source and sink.

### Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as a source type

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-file-formats](../../includes/data-factory-v2-file-formats.md)] 

The following properties are supported for Data Lake Storage Gen2 under `storeSettings` settings in format-based copy source:

| Property                 | Description                                                  | Required                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| type                     | The type property under `storeSettings` must be set to **AzureBlobFSReadSetting**. | Yes                                           |
| recursive                | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. When recursive is set to true and the sink is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the sink. Allowed values are **true** (default) and **false**. | No                                            |
| wildcardFolderPath       | The folder path with wildcard characters under the given file system configured in dataset to filter source folders. <br>Allowed wildcards are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has a wildcard or this escape char inside. <br>See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). | No                                            |
| wildcardFileName         | The file name with wildcard characters under the given file system + folderPath/wildcardFolderPath to filter source files. <br>Allowed wildcards are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has a wildcard or this escape char inside. See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). | Yes if `fileName` isn't specified in dataset |
| modifiedDatetimeStart    | Files filter based on the attribute Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is within the time range between `modifiedDatetimeStart` and `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to the UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br> The properties can be NULL, which means that no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset. When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means that the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal to the datetime value are selected. When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means that the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected. | No                                            |
| modifiedDatetimeEnd      | Same as above.                                               | No                                            |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to storage store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No                                            |

**Example:**

## Preserve metadata during copy

When you copy files from Amazon S3/Azure Blob/Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2/Azure Blob, you can choose to preserve the file metadata along with data. Learn more from [Preserve metadata](copy-activity-preserve-metadata.md#preserve-metadata).

## Preserve ACLs from Data Lake Storage Gen1

>[!TIP]
>To copy data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 into Gen2 in general, see [Copy data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Gen2 with Azure Data Factory](load-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-from-gen1.md) for a walk-through and best practices.

When you copy files from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Gen2, you can choose to preserve the POSIX access control lists (ACLs) along with data. Learn more from [Preserve ACLs from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Gen2](copy-activity-preserve-metadata.md#preserve-acls).

## Mapping data flow properties

When transforming data in mapping data flow, you can read and write files from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in JSON, Avro, Delimited Text, or Parquet format. For more information, see [source transformation](data-flow-source.md) and [sink transformation](data-flow-sink.md) in the mapping data flow feature.

### Source transformation

In the source transformation, you can read from a container, folder or individual file in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. The **Source options** tab lets you manage how the files get read. 

![Source options](media/data-flow/sourceOptions1.png "Source options")

**Wildcard path:** Using a wildcard pattern will instruct ADF to loop through each matching folder and file in a single Source transformation. This is an effective way to process multiple files within a single flow. Add multiple wildcard matching patterns with the + sign that appears when hovering over your existing wildcard pattern.

From your source container, choose a series of files that match a pattern. Only container can be specified in the dataset. Your wildcard path must therefore also include your folder path from the root folder.

Wildcard examples:

* ```*``` Represents any set of characters
* ```**``` Represents recursive directory nesting
* ```?``` Replaces one character
* ```[]``` Matches one of more characters in the brackets

* ```/data/sales/**/*.csv``` Gets all csv files under /data/sales
* ```/data/sales/20??/**``` Gets all files in the 20th century
* ```/data/sales/2004/*/12/[XY]1?.csv``` Gets all csv files in 2004 in December starting with X or Y prefixed by a two-digit number

**Partition Root Path:** If you have partitioned folders in your file source with  a ```key=value``` format (for example, year=2019), then you can assign the top level of that partition folder tree to a column name in your data flow data stream.

First, set a wildcard to include all paths that are the partitioned folders plus the leaf files that you wish to read.

![Partition source file settings](media/data-flow/partfile2.png "Partition file setting")

Use the Partition Root Path setting to define what the top level of the folder structure is. When you view the contents of your data via a data preview, you'll see that ADF will add the resolved partitions found in each of your folder levels.

![Partition root path](media/data-flow/partfile1.png "Partition root path preview")

**List of files:** This is a file set. Create a text file that includes a list of relative path files to process. Point to this text file.

**Column to store file name:** Store the name of the source file in a column in your data. Enter a new column name here to store the file name string.

**After completion:** Choose to do nothing with the source file after the data flow runs, delete the source file, or move the source file. The paths for the move are relative.

To move source files to another location post-processing, first select "Move" for file operation. Then, set the "from" directory. If you're not using any wildcards for your path, then the "from" setting will be the same folder as your source folder.

If you have a source path with wildcard, your syntax will look like this below:

```/data/sales/20??/**/*.csv```

You can specify "from" as

```/data/sales```

And "to" as

```/backup/priorSales```

In this case, all files that were sourced under /data/sales are moved to /backup/priorSales.

> [!NOTE]
> File operations run only when you start the data flow from a pipeline run (a pipeline debug or execution run) that uses the Execute Data Flow activity in a pipeline. File operations *do not* run in Data Flow debug mode.

**Filter by last modified:** You can filter which files you process by specifying a date range of when they were last modified. All date-times are in UTC. 

### Sink properties

In the sink transformation, you can write to either a container or folder in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. the **Settings** tab lets you manage how the files get written.

![sink options](media/data-flow/file-sink-settings.png "sink options")

**Clear the folder:** Determines whether or not the destination folder gets cleared before the data is written.

**File name option:** Determines how the destination files are named in the destination folder. The file name options are:
   * **Default**: Allow Spark to name files based on PART defaults.
   * **Pattern**: Enter a pattern that enumerates your output files per partition. For example, **loans[n].csv** will create loans1.csv, loans2.csv, and so on.
   * **Per partition**: Enter one file name per partition.
   * **As data in column**: Set the output file to the value of a column. The path is relative to the dataset container, not the destination folder.
   * **Output to a single file**: Combine the partitioned output files into a single named file. The path is relative to the dataset folder. Please be aware that te merge operation can possibly fail based upon node size. This option is not recommended for large datasets.

**Quote all:** Determines whether to enclose all values in quotes

## Legacy models

>[!NOTE]
>The following models are still supported as-is for backward compatibility. You are suggested to use the new model mentioned in above sections going forward, and the ADF authoring UI has switched to generating the new model.

### Legacy dataset model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to **AzureBlobFSFile**. |Yes |
| folderPath | Path to the folder in Data Lake Storage Gen2. If not specified, it points to the root. <br/><br/>Wildcard filter is supported. Allowed wildcards are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has a wildcard or this escape char is inside. <br/><br/>Examples: filesystem/folder/. See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). |No |
| fileName | Name or wildcard filter for the files under the specified "folderPath". If you don't specify a value for this property, the dataset points to all files in the folder. <br/><br/>For filter, the wildcards allowed are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character).<br/>- Example 1: `"fileName": "*.csv"`<br/>- Example 2: `"fileName": "???20180427.txt"`<br/>Use `^` to escape if your actual file name has a wildcard or this escape char is inside.<br/><br/>When fileName isn't specified for an output dataset and **preserveHierarchy** isn't specified in the activity sink, the copy activity automatically generates the file name with the following pattern: "*Data.[activity run ID GUID].[GUID if FlattenHierarchy].[format if configured].[compression if configured]*", for example, "Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt.gz". If you copy from a tabular source using a table name instead of a query, the name pattern is "*[table name].[format].[compression if configured]*", for example, "MyTable.csv". |No |
| modifiedDatetimeStart | Files filter based on the attribute Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is within the time range between `modifiedDatetimeStart` and `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to the UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br/><br/> The overall performance of data movement is affected by enabling this setting when you want to do file filter with huge amounts of files. <br/><br/> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset. When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal to the datetime value are selected. When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected.| No |
| modifiedDatetimeEnd | Files filter based on the attribute Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is within the time range between `modifiedDatetimeStart` and `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to the UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br/><br/> The overall performance of data movement is affected by enabling this setting when you want to do file filter with huge amounts of files. <br/><br/> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset. When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal to the datetime value are selected. When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected.| No |
| format | If you want to copy files as is between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both the input and output dataset definitions.<br/><br/>If you want to parse or generate files with a specific format, the following file format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, and **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under **format** to one of these values. For more information, see the [Text format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#text-format), [JSON format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#json-format), [Avro format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#avro-format), [ORC format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#orc-format), and [Parquet format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#parquet-format) sections. |No (only for binary copy scenario) |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. For more information, see [Supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#compression-support).<br/>Supported types are **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**.<br/>Supported levels are **Optimal** and **Fastest**. |No |

>[!TIP]
>To copy all files under a folder, specify **folderPath** only.<br>To copy a single file with a given name, specify **folderPath** with a folder part and **fileName** with a file name.<br>To copy a subset of files under a folder, specify **folderPath** with a folder part and **fileName** with a wildcard filter. 

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "ADLSGen2Dataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlobFSFile",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "myfilesystem/myfolder",
            "fileName": "*",

            "modifiedDatetimeEnd": "2018-12-01T06:00:00Z",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "columnDelimiter": ",",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n"
            },
            "compression": {
                "type": "GZip",
                "level": "Optimal"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Legacy copy activity source model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **AzureBlobFSSource**. |Yes |
| recursive | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. When recursive is set to true and the sink is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the sink.<br/>Allowed values are **true** (default) and **false**. | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to the data store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No |

### Legacy copy activity sink model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to **AzureBlobFSSink**. |Yes |
| copyBehavior | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of the source file to the source folder is identical to the relative path of the target file to the target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the target folder. The target files have autogenerated names. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an autogenerated file name. | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to the data store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No |
