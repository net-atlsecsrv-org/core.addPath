# Azure security baseline for Azure Data Factory

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Data Factory contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see the [Azure security baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: When creating an Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR), you have the option to join it with a virtual network. This will allow Azure Data Factory to create certain network resources, such as a network security group (NSG) and a load balancer. You also have the ability to provide your own static public IP address or have Azure Data Factory create one for you. On the NSG that is automatically created by Azure Data Factory, port 3389 is open to all traffic by default. Lock this down to ensure that only your administrators have access.

Self-Hosted IRs can be deployed on an on-premises machine or Azure virtual machine inside a virtual network. Ensure that your virtual network subnet deployment has an NSG configured to allow only administrative access. Azure-SSIS IR has disallowed port 3389 outbound by default at windows firewall rule on each IR node for protection. You can secure your virtual network-configured resources by associating an NSG with the subnet and setting strict rules.

Where Private Link is available, use private endpoints to secure any resources being linked to your Azure Data Factory pipeline, such as Azure SQL Server. With Private Link, traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet.

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Within Azure Data Factory, ensure that you track and reconcile user access on a regular basis. To create Data Factory instances, the user account that you use to sign in to Azure must be a member of the contributor or owner role, or an administrator of the Azure subscription.

Additionally, at the tenant level, Azure Active Directory (AD) has built-in roles that must be explicitly assigned and are queryable. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups that have administrative access to the control plane of your Azure Data Factory instances.

While Azure AD is the recommended method to administrate user access, keep in mind that if you are running Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), your VM may have local accounts as well. Both local and domain accounts should be reviewed and managed, normally with a minimum footprint. In addition, we would advise that the Privileged Identity Manager is reviewed for the Just In Time feature to reduce the availability of administrative permissions.

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Data Factory uses Azure Active Directory (AD) to provide access to the Azure portal as well as the Azure Data Factory console. Azure AD does not have the concept of default passwords, however, you are responsible to change or not permit default passwords for any custom or third-party applications.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts for access to the Azure control plane (Azure portal) as well as the Azure Data Factory console. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts within Azure AD.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

If you are running your Integration Runtime on an Azure Virtual Machine, the administrator accounts on Azure Virtual Machines can also be configured with the Azure Privileged Identity Manager (PIM). Azure Privileged Identity Manager provides several options such as Just in Time elevation, Multi-Factor Authentication, and delegation options so that permissions are only available for specific time frames and require a second person to approve.

### 4.3: Monitor and block unauthorized transfer of sensitive information

**Guidance**: For data sources (such as Azure SQL Database) storing or processing sensitive information for your Azure Data Factory deployment, mark the related resources as sensitive using tags.

Where Private Link is available, use private endpoints to secure any resources being linked to your Azure Data Factory pipeline. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can also reduce the risk of data exfiltration by configuring a strict set of outbound rules on a network security group (NSG) and associating that NSG with your subnet.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: We recommend that you enable the data encryption mechanism for any data stores related to your Azure Data Factory deployments. You can refer to the security baseline for that service for more information regarding the encryption of data at rest.

If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine, Virtual disks on Windows Virtual Machines (VM) are encrypted at rest using either Server-side encryption or Azure disk encryption (ADE). Azure Disk Encryption leverages the BitLocker feature of Windows to encrypt managed disks with customer-managed keys within the guest VM. Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys improves on ADE by enabling you to use any OS types and images for your VMs by encrypting data in the Storage service.

You can store credentials or secret values in an Azure Key Vault and use them during pipeline execution to pass to your activities. You can also store credentials for data stores and computes in an Azure Key Vault. Azure Data Factory retrieves the credentials when executing an activity that uses the data store/compute.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and you back that VM up with Azure Backup, your VM is encrypted at rest with Storage Service Encryption (SSE). Azure Backup can also back up Azure VMs that are encrypted by using Azure Disk Encryption. Azure Disk Encryption integrates with BitLocker encryption keys (BEKs), which are safeguarded in a key vault as secrets. Azure Disk Encryption also integrates with Azure Key Vault key encryption keys (KEKs). Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems’ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.
