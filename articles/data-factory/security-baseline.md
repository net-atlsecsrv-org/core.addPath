# Azure security baseline for Azure Data Factory

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Data Factory. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Data Factory. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Data Factory have been excluded.

To see how Azure Data Factory completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see [full Azure Data Factory security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: When creating an Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR), you have the option to join it with a virtual network. This will allow Azure Data Factory to create certain network resources, such as a network security group (NSG) and a load balancer. You also have the ability to provide your own static public IP address or have Azure Data Factory create one for you.  On the NSG that is automatically created by Azure Data Factory, port 3389 is open to all traffic by default. Lock this down to ensure that only your administrators have access.

Self-Hosted IRs can be deployed on an on-premises machine or Azure virtual machine inside a virtual network. Ensure that your virtual network subnet deployment has an  NSG configured to allow only administrative access. Azure-SSIS IR has disallowed port 3389 outbound by default at windows firewall rule on each IR node for protection. You can secure your virtual network-configured resources by associating an NSG with the subnet and setting strict rules.

Where Private Link is available, use private endpoints to secure any resources being linked to your Azure Data Factory pipeline, such as Azure SQL Server. With Private Link, traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the virtual network and network security group associated with your Integration Runtime deployment.

Additionally, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs for the NSG protecting your Integration Runtime deployment and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic auditing.

You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: If you want to inspect outbound traffic from Azure-SSIS IR, you can route traffic initiated from Azure-SSIS IR to
on-premises firewall appliance via Azure ExpressRoute force tunneling or to a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) from Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS capabilities. If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection is not a requirement, Azure Firewall with Threat Intelligence can be used.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security group (NSG) or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., DataFactoryManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny inbound traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network settings and network resources associated with your Azure data Factory instances with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.DataFactory" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Data Factory instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions related to networking or your Azure Data factory instances, such as:
"DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled".

- [How to create an Azure Blueprint](../governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: Use tags for resources related to network security and traffic flow for your Azure Data Factory instances to provide metadata and logical organization.

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as, "Require tag and its value," to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

- [How to create and use tags](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by Azure Data Factory. Within Azure Monitor, you are able to query the Log Analytics workspace that is configured to receive your Azure Data Factory activity logs. Use Azure Storage Accounts for long-term/archival log storage or event hubs for exporting data to other systems.

Alternatively, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).You can also integrate Azure Data Factory with Git to leverage several source control benefits, such as the ability to track/audit changes and the ability to revert changes that introduce bugs.

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage Account for archive. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure resources.

Use diagnostic settings to configure diagnostic logs for noncompute resources in Azure Data Factory, such as metrics and pipeline-run data. Azure Data Factory stores pipeline-run data for 45 days. To retain this data for  longer period of time, save your diagnostic logs to a storage account for auditing or manual inspection and specify the retention time in days.  You can also stream the logs to Azure Event Hubs or send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace for analysis.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.4: Collect security logs from operating systems

**Guidance**: If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), you can use Azure Monitor to collect data from the virtual machine. Installing the Log Analytics VM extension allows Azure Monitor to collect data from your Azure VMs. Azure Security Center can then provide Security Event log monitoring for Virtual Machines. Given the volume of data that the security event log generates, it is not stored by default. 

If your organization would like to retain the  security event log data, it can be stored within a Data Collection tier, at which point it can be queried in Log Analytics.

### 2.6: Monitor and review logs

**Guidance**: Enable diagnostic settings for Azure Data Factory and send logs to a Log Analytics workspace. Use Log Analytics to analyze and monitor your logs for anomalous behavior and regularly review results. Ensure that you also enable diagnostic settings for any data stores related to your Azure Data Factory deployments. Refer to each service's security baseline for guidance on how to enable diagnostic settings.

If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), enable diagnostic settings for the VM as well.

Alternatively, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

### 2.7: Enable alerts for anomalous activities

**Guidance**: You can raise alerts on supported metrics in Data Factory by going to the Alerts &amp; Metrics section in Azure Monitor.

Configure diagnostic settings for Azure Data Factory and send logs to a Log Analytics workspace. Within your Log Analytics workspace, configure alerts to take place for when a pre-defined set of conditions takes place. Alternatively, you may enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

Additionally, ensure that you enable diagnostic settings for services related to your data stores. You can refer to each service's security baseline for guidance.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.10: Enable command-line audit logging

**Guidance**: If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), you can enable command-line audit logging. The Azure Security Center provides Security Event log monitoring for Azure VMs.  Security Center provisions the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on all supported Azure VMs and any new ones that are created if automatic provisioning is enabled or you can install the agent manually.  The agent enables the process creation event 4688 and the CommandLine field inside event 4688. New processes created on the VM are recorded by EventLog and monitored by Security Center's detection services.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Within Azure Data Factory, ensure that you track and reconcile user access on a regular basis. To create Data Factory instances, the user account that you use to sign in to Azure must be a member of the contributor or owner role, or an administrator of the Azure subscription.

Additionally, at the tenant level, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) has built-in roles that must be explicitly assigned and are queryable. Use the Azure AD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of administrative groups that have administrative access to the control plane of your Azure Data Factory instances.

While Azure AD is the recommended method to administrate user access, keep in mind that if you are running Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), your VM may have local accounts as well. Both local and domain accounts should be reviewed and managed, normally with a minimum footprint. In addition, we would advise that the Privileged Identity Manager is reviewed for the Just In Time feature to reduce the availability of administrative permissions.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Data Factory uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide access to the Azure portal as well as the Azure Data Factory console. Azure AD does not have the concept of default passwords, however, you are responsible to change or not permit default passwords for any custom or third-party applications.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts for access to the Azure control plane (Azure portal) as well as the Azure Data Factory console. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts within Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

If you are running your Integration Runtime on an Azure Virtual Machine, the administrator accounts on Azure Virtual Machines can also be configured with the Azure Privileged Identity Manager (PIM). Azure Privileged Identity Manager provides several options such as Just in Time elevation, multifactor authentication, and delegation options so that permissions are only available for specific time frames and require a second person to approve.

### 3.7: Log and alert on suspicious activities from administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) security reports for generation of logs and alerts when suspicious or unsafe activity occurs in the environment. Use Azure Security Center to monitor identity and access activity.

If you are running your Integration Runtime on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), you can, additionally, on-board your VM to Azure Sentinel. Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: A data factory can be associated with a managed identity for Azure resources that represents the specific data factory. You can use this managed identity for Azure SQL Database authentication. The designated factory can access and copy data from or to your database by using this identity.

If you are running your Integration Runtime (IR) on an Azure Virtual Machine, you can use managed identities to authenticate to any service that supports Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code. Your code that's running on a virtual machine, can use managed identity to request access tokens for services that support Azure AD authentication.

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides logs to help you discover stale accounts. In addition, use Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right Users have continued access.

If you are running your Runtime Integration in an Azure Virtual Machine, you will need to review the local security groups and users to make sure that there are no unexpected accounts which could compromise the system.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: You have access to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with any SIEM/Monitoring tool. You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), on-board that VM to Azure Sentinel. Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.1: Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information

**Guidance**: Use tags to assist in tracking Azure resources that store or process sensitive information.

Use the Azure SQL Database data discovery and classification feature. Data discovery and classification provides advanced capabilities built into Azure SQL Database for discovering, classifying, labeling &amp; protecting the sensitive data in your databases.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: Implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. Integration Runtimes should be separated by virtual network (VNet)/subnet and tagged appropriately.

You may also use Private Endpoints to perform network isolation. An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.3: Monitor and block unauthorized transfer of sensitive information

**Guidance**: For data sources (such as Azure SQL Database) storing or processing sensitive information for your Azure Data Factory deployment, mark the related resources as sensitive using tags.

Where Private Link is available, use private endpoints to secure any resources being linked to your Azure Data Factory pipeline. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can also reduce the risk of data exfiltration by configuring a strict set of outbound rules on a network security group (NSG) and associating that NSG with your subnet.

### 4.4: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: If the cloud data store supports HTTPS or TLS, all data transfers between data movement services in Data Factory and a cloud data store are via secure channel HTTPS or TLS. TLS version used is 1.2. 

All connections to Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) require encryption (SSL/TLS) while data is in transit to and from the database. When you're authoring a pipeline by using JSON, add the encryption property and set it to true in the connection string. For Azure Storage, you can use HTTPS in the connection string.

### 4.5: Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data

**Guidance**: If you use Azure Data Factory to copy and transform your Azure SQL Database instances, use the Azure SQL Database data discovery and classification feature. Data discovery and classification provides advanced capabilities built into Azure SQL Database for discovering, classifying, labeling &amp; protecting the sensitive data in your databases.

Data discovery and classification features are not yet available for other Azure services.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: We recommend that you enable the data encryption mechanism for any data stores related to your Azure Data Factory deployments. You can refer to the security baseline for that service for more information regarding the encryption of data at rest.

If you are running your Integration Runtime in an Azure Virtual Machine, Virtual disks on Windows Virtual Machines (VM) are encrypted at rest using either Server-side encryption or Azure disk encryption (ADE). Azure Disk Encryption leverages the BitLocker feature of Windows to encrypt managed disks with customer-managed keys within the guest VM. Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys improves on ADE by enabling you to use any OS types and images for your VMs by encrypting data in the Storage service.

You can store credentials or secret values in an Azure Key Vault and use them during pipeline execution to pass to your activities. You can also store credentials for data stores and computes in an Azure Key Vault. Azure Data Factory retrieves the credentials when executing an activity that uses the data store/compute.
