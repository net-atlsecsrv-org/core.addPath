# Copy data from and to IBM Informix data stores using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from an IBM Informix data store. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Informix connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Informix source to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

## Prerequisites

To use this Informix connector, you need to:

- Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.
- Install the Informix ODBC driver for the data store on the Integration Runtime machine. For example, you can use driver "IBM INFORMIX Informix DRIVER (64-bit)".

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Informix connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Informix linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Informix** | Yes |
| connectionString | The ODBC connection string excluding the credential portion. You can specify the connection string or use the system DSN (Data Source Name) you set up on the Integration Runtime machine (you need still specify the credential portion in linked service accordingly). <br> You can also put a password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) with more details.| Yes |
| authenticationType | Type of authentication used to connect to the Informix data store.<br/>Allowed values are: **Basic** and **Anonymous**. | Yes |
| userName | Specify user name if you are using Basic authentication. | No |
| password | Specify password for the user account you specified for the userName. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| credential | The access credential portion of the connection string specified in driver-specific property-value format. Mark this field as a SecureString. | No |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. A Self-hosted Integration Runtime is required as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). |Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "InformixLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Informix",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "<Informix connection string or DSN>",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "userName": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Informix dataset.

To copy data from Informix, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **InformixTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table in the Informix. | No for source (if "query" in activity source is specified);<br/>Yes for sink |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "InformixDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "InformixTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Informix linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "<table name>"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Informix source.

### Informix as source

To copy data from Informix, the following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **InformixSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromInformix",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Informix input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "InformixSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
