# Parquet format in Azure Data Factory

Follow this article when you want to **parse the Parquet files or write the data into Parquet format**. 

Parquet format is supported for the following connectors: [Amazon S3](connector-amazon-simple-storage-service.md), [Azure Blob](connector-azure-blob-storage.md), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md), [Azure File Storage](connector-azure-file-storage.md), [File System](connector-file-system.md), [FTP](connector-ftp.md), [Google Cloud Storage](connector-google-cloud-storage.md), [HDFS](connector-hdfs.md), [HTTP](connector-http.md), and [SFTP](connector-sftp.md).

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Parquet dataset.

| Property         | Description                                                  | Required |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type             | The type property of the dataset must be set to **Parquet**. | Yes      |
| location         | Location settings of the file(s). Each file-based connector has its own location type and supported properties under `location`. **See details in connector article -> Dataset properties section**. | Yes      |
| compressionCodec | The compression codec to use when writing to Parquet files. When reading from Parquet files, Data Factory automatically determine the compression codec based on the file metadata.<br>Supported types are “**none**”, “**gzip**”, “**snappy**” (default), and "**lzo**". Note currently Copy activity doesn't support LZO. | No       |

> [!NOTE]
> White space in column name is not supported for Parquet files.

Below is an example of Parquet dataset on Azure Blob Storage:

```json
{
    "name": "ParquetDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Parquet",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Azure Blob Storage linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "schema": [ < physical schema, optional, retrievable during authoring > ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "AzureBlobStorageLocation",
                "container": "containername",
                "folderPath": "folder/subfolder",
            },
            "compressionCodec": "snappy"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Parquet source and sink.

### Parquet as source

The following properties are supported in the copy activity ***\*source\**** section.

| Property      | Description                                                  | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type          | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **ParquetSource**. | Yes      |
| storeSettings | A group of properties on how to read data from a data store. Each file-based connector has its own supported read settings under `storeSettings`. **See details in connector article -> Copy activity properties section**. | No       |

### Parquet as sink

The following properties are supported in the copy activity ***\*sink\**** section.

| Property      | Description                                                  | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type          | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **ParquetSink**. | Yes      |
| storeSettings | A group of properties on how to write data to a data store. Each file-based connector has its own supported write settings under `storeSettings`. **See details in connector article -> Copy activity properties section**. | No       |

## Mapping data flow properties

Learn details from [source transformation](data-flow-source.md) and [sink transformation](data-flow-sink.md) in mapping data flow.

## Data type support

Parquet complex data types are currently not supported (e.g. MAP, LIST, STRUCT).

## Using Self-hosted Integration Runtime

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For copy empowered by Self-hosted Integration Runtime e.g. between on-premises and cloud data stores, if you are not copying Parquet files **as-is**, you need to install the **64-bit JRE 8 (Java Runtime Environment) or OpenJDK** on your IR machine. See the following paragraph with more details.

For copy running on Self-hosted IR with Parquet file serialization/deserialization, ADF locates the Java runtime by firstly checking the registry *`(SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\{Current Version}\JavaHome)`* for JRE, if not found, secondly checking system variable *`JAVA_HOME`* for OpenJDK.

- **To use JRE**: The 64-bit IR requires 64-bit JRE. You can find it from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=808605).
- **To use OpenJDK**: it's supported since IR version 3.13. Package the jvm.dll with all other required assemblies of OpenJDK into Self-hosted IR machine, and set system environment variable JAVA_HOME accordingly.

> [!TIP]
> If you copy data to/from Parquet format using Self-hosted Integration Runtime and hit error saying "An error occurred when invoking java, message: **java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:Java heap space**", you can add an environment variable `_JAVA_OPTIONS` in the machine that hosts the Self-hosted IR to adjust the min/max heap size for JVM to empower such copy, then rerun the pipeline.

![Set JVM heap size on Self-hosted IR](./media/supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs/set-jvm-heap-size-on-selfhosted-ir.png)

Example: set variable `_JAVA_OPTIONS` with value `-Xms256m -Xmx16g`. The flag `Xms` specifies the initial memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), while `Xmx` specifies the maximum memory allocation pool. This means that JVM will be started with `Xms` amount of memory and will be able to use a maximum of `Xmx` amount of memory. By default, ADF use min 64MB and max 1G.
