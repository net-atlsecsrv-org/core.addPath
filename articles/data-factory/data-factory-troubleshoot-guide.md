# Troubleshoot Azure Data Factory

This article explores common troubleshooting methods for external control activities in Azure Data Factory.

## Connector and copy activity

For connector issues e.g. encounter error using copy activity, refer to [Troubleshoot Azure Data Factory Connectors](connector-troubleshoot-guide.md).

## Azure Databricks

### Error code:  3200

- **Message**: Error 403.

- **Cause**: `The Databricks access token has expired.`

- **Recommendation**: By default, the Azure Databricks access token is valid for 90 days. Create a new token and update the linked service.


### Error code:  3201

- **Message**: `Missing required field: settings.task.notebook_task.notebook_path.`

- **Cause**: `Bad authoring: Notebook path not specified correctly.`

- **Recommendation**: Specify the notebook path in the Databricks activity.

<br/>

- **Message**: `Cluster   ... does not exist.`

- **Cause**: `Authoring error: Databricks cluster does not exist or has been deleted.`

- **Recommendation**: Verify that the Databricks cluster exists.

<br/>

- **Message**: `Invalid Python file URI.... Please visit Databricks user guide for supported URI schemes.`

- **Cause**: `Bad authoring.`

- **Recommendation**: Specify either absolute paths for workspace-addressing schemes, or `dbfs:/folder/subfolder/foo.py` for files stored in Databricks File System.

<br/>

- **Message**: `{0} LinkedService should have domain and accessToken as required properties.`

- **Cause**: `Bad authoring.`

- **Recommendation**: Verify the [linked service definition](compute-linked-services.md#azure-databricks-linked-service).

<br/>

- **Message**: `{0} LinkedService should specify either existing cluster ID or new cluster information for creation.`

- **Cause**:  `Bad authoring.`

- **Recommendation**: Verify the [linked service definition](compute-linked-services.md#azure-databricks-linked-service).

<br/>

- **Message**: `Node type Standard_D16S_v3 is not supported. Supported node types:   Standard_DS3_v2, Standard_DS4_v2, Standard_DS5_v2, Standard_D8s_v3,   Standard_D16s_v3, Standard_D32s_v3, Standard_D64s_v3, Standard_D3_v2,   Standard_D8_v3, Standard_D16_v3, Standard_D32_v3, Standard_D64_v3,   Standard_D12_v2, Standard_D13_v2, Standard_D14_v2, Standard_D15_v2,   Standard_DS12_v2, Standard_DS13_v2, Standard_DS14_v2, Standard_DS15_v2,   Standard_E8s_v3, Standard_E16s_v3, Standard_E32s_v3, Standard_E64s_v3,   Standard_L4s, Standard_L8s, Standard_L16s, Standard_L32s, Standard_F4s,   Standard_F8s, Standard_F16s, Standard_H16, Standard_F4s_v2, Standard_F8s_v2,   Standard_F16s_v2, Standard_F32s_v2, Standard_F64s_v2, Standard_F72s_v2,   Standard_NC12, Standard_NC24, Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3,   Standard_NC24s_v3, Standard_L8s_v2, Standard_L16s_v2, Standard_L32s_v2,   Standard_L64s_v2, Standard_L80s_v2.`

- **Cause**: `Bad authoring.`

- **Recommendation**: Refer to the error message. 

<br/>

### Error code:  3202

- **Message**: `There were already 1000 jobs created in past 3600 seconds, exceeding rate limit:   1000 job creations per 3600 seconds.`

- **Cause**: `Too many Databricks runs in an hour.`

- **Recommendation**: Check all pipelines that use this Databricks workspace for their job   creation rate.  If pipelines launched   too many Databricks runs in aggregate, migrate some pipelines to a new   workspace.

<br/>

- **Message**: `Could not parse request object: Expected 'key' and 'value' to be set for JSON map field base_parameters, got 'key: "..."' instead.`

- **Cause**: `Authoring error: No value provided for the parameter.`

- **Recommendation**: Inspect the pipeline JSON and ensure all parameters in the baseParameters notebook specify a nonempty value.

<br/>

- **Message**: `User: `SimpleUserContext{userId=..., name=user@company.com, orgId=...}` is not   authorized to access cluster.`

- **Cause**: The user who generated the access token isn't allowed to access the   Databricks cluster specified in the linked service.

- **Recommendation**: Ensure the user has the required permissions in the workspace.


### Error code:  3203

- **Message**: `The cluster is in Terminated state, not available to receive jobs. Please fix the cluster or retry later.`

- **Cause**: The cluster was terminated. For interactive clusters, this might be a race condition.

- **Recommendation**: The best way to avoid this error is to use job clusters.


### Error code:  3204

- **Message**: `Job execution failed.`

- **Cause**:  Error messages indicate various issues, such as an unexpected cluster state or a specific activity. Most often no error   message appears at all. 

- **Recommendation**: N/A


## Azure Data Lake Analytics

The following table applies to U-SQL.


### Error code:  2709

- **Message**: `The access token is from the wrong tenant.`

- **Cause**:  Incorrect Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

- **Recommendation**: Incorrect Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

- **Message**: `We cannot accept your job at this moment. The maximum number of queued jobs for   your account is 200. `

- **Cause**:  This error is caused by throttling on Data Lake Analytics.

- **Recommendation**: Reduce the number of submitted jobs to Data Lake Analytics by changing Data Factory triggers and concurrency settings on activities. Or increase the limits on Data Lake Analytics.

<br/>

- **Message**: `This job was rejected because it requires 24 AUs. This account's administrator-defined policy prevents a job from using more than 5 AUs.`

- **Cause**:  This error is caused by throttling on Data Lake Analytics. 

- **Recommendation**: Reduce the number of submitted jobs to Data Lake Analytics by changing Data Factory triggers and concurrency settings on activities. Or increase the limits on Data Lake Analytics.


### Error code:  2705

- **Message**: `Forbidden. ACL verification failed. Either the resource does not exist or the user is not authorized to perform the requested operation.<br/><br/>User is   not able to access Data Lake Store.  <br/><br/>User is  not authorized to use Data Lake Analytics.`

- **Cause**: The provided cluster URI is invalid. 

- **Recommendation**:  Make sure that the cluster hasn't been deleted and that the provided URI is correct. When you open the URI in a browser, you   should see the Ambari UI. If the cluster is in a virtual network, the URI should be   the private URI. To open it, use a VM that's part of the same virtual network. For more information, see [Directly connect to Apache Hadoop services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network#directly-connect-to-apache-hadoop-services).

<br/>

- **Message**: `Hadoop job submission failed. Job: …, Cluster: …/. Error: A task was canceled.`

- **Cause**: The job submission timed out. 

- **Recommendation**: The problem could be either general HDInsight connectivity or network   connectivity. First confirm that the HDInsight Ambari UI is available from any   browser. Confirm that your credentials are still valid. If you're using self-hosted integrated runtime (IR), make sure to do this from the   VM or machine where the self-hosted IR is installed. Then   try submitting the job from Data Factory again. If it still fails, contact the Data Factory team   for support.


- **Message**: `Unauthorized: Ambari user name or password is incorrect  <br/><br/>Unauthorized: User admin is locked out in Ambari.   <br/><br/>403 - Forbidden: Access is denied.`
