# Copy data from Web table by using Azure Data Factory
> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory service you are using:"]
> * [Version 1](v1/data-factory-web-table-connector.md)
> * [Current version](connector-web-table.md)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from a Web table database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

The difference among this Web table connector, the [REST connector](connector-rest.md) and the [HTTP connector](connector-http.md) are:

- **Web table connector** extracts table content from an HTML webpage.
- **REST connector** specifically support copying data from RESTful APIs.
- **HTTP connector** is generic to retrieve data from any HTTP endpoint, e.g. to download file. 

## Supported capabilities

This Web table connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Web table database to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Web table connector supports **extracting table content from an HTML page**.

## Prerequisites

To use this Web table connector, you need to set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Web table connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Web table linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Web** |Yes |
| url | URL to the Web source |Yes |
| authenticationType | Allowed value is: **Anonymous**. |Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. A Self-hosted Integration Runtime is required as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). |Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "WebLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Web",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url" : "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/",
            "authenticationType": "Anonymous"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Web table dataset.

To copy data from Web table, set the type property of the dataset to **WebTable**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **WebTable** | Yes |
| path |A relative URL to the resource that contains the table. |No. When path is not specified, only the URL specified in the linked service definition is used. |
| index |The index of the table in the resource. See [Get index of a table in an HTML page](#get-index-of-a-table-in-an-html-page) section for steps to getting index of a table in an HTML page. |Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "WebTableInput",
    "properties": {
        "type": "WebTable",
        "typeProperties": {
            "index": 1,
            "path": "AFI's_100_Years...100_Movies"
        },
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Web linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Web table source.

### Web table as source

To copy data from Web table, set the source type in the copy activity to **WebSource**, no additional properties are supported.

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromWebTable",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Web table input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "WebSource"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Get index of a table in an HTML page

To get the index of a table which you need to configure in [dataset properties](#dataset-properties), you can use e.g. Excel 2016 as the tool as follows:

1. Launch **Excel 2016** and switch to the **Data** tab.
2. Click **New Query** on the toolbar, point to **From Other Sources** and click **From Web**.

    ![Power Query menu](./media/copy-data-from-web-table/PowerQuery-Menu.png)
3. In the **From Web** dialog box, enter **URL** that you would use in linked service JSON (for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) along with path you would specify for the dataset (for example: AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies), and click **OK**.

    ![From Web dialog](./media/copy-data-from-web-table/FromWeb-DialogBox.png)

    URL used in this example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies
4. If you see **Access Web content** dialog box, select the right **URL**, **authentication**, and click **Connect**.

   ![Access Web content dialog box](./media/copy-data-from-web-table/AccessWebContentDialog.png)
5. Click a **table** item in the tree view to see content from the table and then click **Edit** button at the bottom.  

   ![Navigator dialog](./media/copy-data-from-web-table/Navigator-DialogBox.png)
6. In the **Query Editor** window, click **Advanced Editor** button on the toolbar.

    ![Advanced Editor button](./media/copy-data-from-web-table/QueryEditor-AdvancedEditorButton.png)
7. In the Advanced Editor dialog box, the number next to "Source" is the index.

    ![Advanced Editor - Index](./media/copy-data-from-web-table/AdvancedEditor-Index.png)

If you are using Excel 2013, use [Microsoft Power Query for Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39379) to get the index. See [Connect to a web page](https://support.office.com/article/Connect-to-a-web-page-Power-Query-b2725d67-c9e8-43e6-a590-c0a175bd64d8) article for details. The steps are similar if you are using [Microsoft Power BI for Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
