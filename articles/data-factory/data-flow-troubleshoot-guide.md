# Troubleshoot mapping data flows in Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article explores common troubleshooting methods for mapping data flows in Azure Data Factory.

## Common error codes and messages 

### Error code: DF-Executor-SourceInvalidPayload
- **Message**: Data preview, debug, and pipeline data flow execution failed because container does not exist
- **Cause**: A dataset contains a container that doesn't exist in storage.
- **Recommendation**: Make sure that the container referenced in your dataset exists and can be accessed.

### Error code: DF-Executor-SystemInvalidJson

- **Message**: JSON parsing error, unsupported encoding or multiline
- **Cause**: Possible problems with the JSON file: unsupported encoding, corrupt bytes, or using JSON source as a single document on many nested lines.
- **Recommendation**: Verify that the JSON file's encoding is supported. On the source transformation that's using a JSON dataset, expand **JSON Settings** and turn on **Single Document**.
 
### Error code: DF-Executor-BroadcastTimeout

- **Message**: Broadcast join timeout error, make sure broadcast stream produces data within 60 secs in debug runs and 300 secs in job runs
- **Cause**: Broadcast has a default timeout of 60 seconds on debug runs and 300 seconds on job runs. The stream chosen for broadcast is too large to produce data within this limit.
- **Recommendation**: Check the **Optimize** tab on your data flow transformations for join, exists, and lookup. The default option for broadcast is **Auto**. If **Auto** is set, or if you're manually setting the left or right side to broadcast under **Fixed**, you can either set a larger Azure integration runtime (IR) configuration or turn off broadcast. For the best performance in data flows, we recommend that you allow Spark to broadcast by using **Auto** and use a memory-optimized Azure IR. 
 
  If you're running the data flow in a debug test execution from a debug pipeline run, you might run into this condition more frequently. That's because Azure Data Factory throttles the broadcast timeout to 60 seconds to maintain a faster debugging experience. You can extend the timeout to the 300-second timeout of a triggered run. To do so, you can use the **Debug** > **Use Activity Runtime** option to use the Azure IR defined in your Execute Data Flow pipeline activity.

- **Message**: Broadcast join timeout error, you can choose 'Off' of broadcast option in join/exists/lookup transformation to avoid this issue. If you intend to broadcast join option to improve performance then make sure broadcast stream can produce data within 60 secs in debug runs and 300 secs in job runs.
- **Cause**: Broadcast has a default timeout of 60 seconds in debug runs and 300 seconds in job runs. On the broadcast join, the stream chosen for broadcast is too large to produce data within this limit. If a broadcast join isn't used, the default broadcast by dataflow can reach the same limit.
- **Recommendation**: Turn off the broadcast option or avoid broadcasting large data streams for which the processing can take more than 60 seconds. Choose a smaller stream to broadcast. Large Azure SQL Data Warehouse tables and source files aren't typically good choices. In the absence of a broadcast join, use a larger cluster if this error occurs.

### Error code: DF-Executor-Conversion

- **Message**: Converting to a date or time failed due to an invalid character
- **Cause**: Data isn't in the expected format.
- **Recommendation**: Use the correct data type.

### Error code: DF-Executor-InvalidColumn
- **Message**: Column name needs to be specified in the query, set an alias if using a SQL function
- **Cause**: No column name is specified.
- **Recommendation**: Set an alias if you're using a SQL function like min() or max().

### Error code: DF-Executor-DriverError
- **Message**: INT96 is legacy timestamp type which is not supported by ADF Dataflow. Please consider upgrading the column type to the latest types.
- **Cause**: Driver error.
- **Recommendation**: INT96 is a legacy timestamp type that's not supported by Azure Data Factory data flow. Consider upgrading the column type to the latest type.

### Error code: DF-Executor-BlockCountExceedsLimitError
- **Message**: The uncommitted block count cannot exceed the maximum limit of 100,000 blocks. Check blob configuration.
- **Cause**: The maximum number of uncommitted blocks in a blob is 100,000.
- **Recommendation**: Contact the Microsoft product team for more details about this problem.

### Error code: DF-Executor-PartitionDirectoryError
- **Message**: The specified source path has either multiple partitioned directories (for e.g. <Source Path>/<Partition Root Directory 1>/a=10/b=20, <Source Path>/<Partition Root Directory 2>/c=10/d=30) or partitioned directory with other file or non-partitioned directory (for example <Source Path>/<Partition Root Directory 1>/a=10/b=20, <Source Path>/Directory 2/file1), remove partition root directory from source path and read it through separate source transformation.
- **Cause**: The source path has either multiple partitioned directories or a partitioned directory that has another file or non-partitioned directory.
- **Recommendation**: Remove the partitioned root directory from the source path and read it through separate source transformation.

### Error code: DF-Executor-InvalidType
- **Message**: Please make sure that the type of parameter matches with type of value passed in. Passing float parameters from pipelines isn't currently supported.
- **Cause**: Data types are incompatible between the declared type and the actual parameter value.
- **Recommendation**: Check that the parameter values passed into the data flow match the declared type.

### Error code: DF-Executor-ParseError

- **Recommendation**: For non-equality based joins, use CROSS JOIN.

### Error code: GetCommand OutputAsync failed
- **Message**: During Data Flow debug and data preview: GetCommand OutputAsync failed with ...
- **Cause**: This error is a back-end service error. 
- **Recommendation**: Retry the operation and restart your debugging session. If retrying and restarting doesn't resolve the problem, contact customer support. 

### Error code: DF-Executor-OutOfMemoryError
 
- **Message**: Cluster ran into out of memory issue during execution, please retry using an integration runtime with bigger core count and/or memory optimized compute type
- **Cause**: The cluster is running out of memory.

## Miscellaneous troubleshooting tips
- **Issue**: Unexpected exception occurred and execution failed.
	- **Message**: During Data Flow activity execution: Hit unexpected exception and execution failed.
	- **Cause**: This error is a back-end service error. Retry the operation and restart your debugging session.
	- **Recommendation**: If retrying and restarting doesn't resolve the problem, contact customer support.

-  **Issue**: No output data on join during debug data preview.
	- **Message**: There are a high number of null values or missing values which may be caused by having too few rows sampled. Try updating the debug row limit and refreshing the data.
	- **Cause**: The join condition either didn't match any rows or resulted in a large number of null values during the data preview.
	- **Recommendation**: In **Debug Settings**, increase the number of rows in the source row limit. Be sure to select an Azure IR that has a data flow cluster that's large enough to handle more data.
	
- **Issue**: Validation error at source with multiline CSV files. 
	- **Message**: You might see one of these error messages:
		- The last column is null or missing.
		- Schema validation at source fails.
		- Schema import fails to show correctly in the UX and the last column has a new line character in the name.
	- **Cause**: In the Mapping data flow, multiline CSV source files don't currently work when \r\n is used as the row delimiter. Sometimes extra lines at carriage returns can cause errors. 
	- **Recommendation**: Generate the file at the source by using \n as the row delimiter rather than \r\n. Or use the Copy activity to convert the CSV file to use \n as a row delimiter.

## General troubleshooting guidance
1. Check the status of your dataset connections. In each source and sink transformation, go to the linked service for each dataset that you're using and test the connections.
2. Check the status of your file and table connections in the data flow designer. In debug mode, select **Data Preview** on your source transformations to ensure that you can access your data.
3. If everything looks correct in data preview, go into the Pipeline designer and put your data flow in a Pipeline activity. Debug the pipeline for an end-to-end test.

### Improvement on CSV/CDM format in Data Flow 

If you use the **Delimited Text or CDM formatting for mapping data flow in Azure Data Factory V2**, you may face the behavior changes to your existing pipelines because of the improvement for Delimited Text/CDM in data flow starting from **1 May 2021**. 

You may encounter the following issues before the improvement, but after the improvement, the issues were fixed. Read the following content to determine whether this improvement affects you. 

#### Scenario 1: Encounter the unexpected row delimiter issue

 You are affected if you are in the following conditions:
 - Using the Delimited Text with the Multiline setting set to True or CDM as the source.
 - The first row has more than 128 characters. 
 - The row delimiter in data files is not `\n`.

 Before the improvement, the default row delimiter `\n` may be unexpectedly used to parse delimited text files, because when Multiline setting is set to True, it invalidates the row delimiter setting, and the row delimiter is automatically detected based on the first 128 characters. If you fail to detect the actual row delimiter, it would fall back to `\n`.  

 After the improvement, any one of the three row delimiters: `\r`, `\n`, `\r\n` should be worked.
 
 The following example shows you one pipeline behavior change after the improvement:

 **Example**:<br/>
   For the following column:<br/>
    `C1, C2, {long first row}, C128\r\n `<br/>
    `V1, V2, {values………………….}, V128\r\n `<br/>
 
   Before the improvement, `\r` is kept in the column value. The parsed column result is:<br/>
   `C1 C2 {long first row} C128`**`\r`**<br/>
   `V1 V2 {values………………….} V128`**`\r`**<br/> 

   After the improvement, the parsed column result should be:<br/>
   `C1 C2 {long first row} C128`<br/>
   `V1 V2 {values………………….} V128`<br/>
  
#### Scenario 2: Encounter an issue of incorrectly reading column values containing '\r\n'

 You are affected if you are in the following conditions:
 - Using the Delimited Text with the Multiline setting set to True or CDM as a source. 
 - The row delimiter is `\r\n`.

 Before the improvement, when reading the column value, the `\r\n` in it may be incorrectly replaced by `\n`. 

 After the improvement, `\r\n` in the column value will not be replaced by `\n`.

 The following example shows you one pipeline behavior change after the improvement:
 
 **Example**:<br/>
  
 For the following column：<br/>
  **`"A\r\n"`**`, B, C\r\n`<br/>

 Before the improvement, the parsed column result is:<br/>
  **`A\n`**` B C`<br/>

 After the improvement, the parsed column result should be:<br/>
  **`A\r\n`**` B C`<br/>  

#### Scenario 3: Encounter an issue of incorrectly writing column values containing '\n'

 You are affected if you are in the following conditions:
 - Using the Delimited Text as a sink.
 - The column value contains `\n`.
 - The row delimiter is set to `\r\n`.
 
 Before the improvement, when writing the column value, the `\n` in it may be incorrectly replaced by `\r\n`. 

 After the improvement, `\n` in the column value will not be replaced by `\r\n`.
 
 The following example shows you one pipeline behavior change after the improvement:

 **Example**:<br/>

 For the following column:<br/>
 **`A\n`**` B C`<br/>

 Before the improvement, the CSV sink is:<br/>
  **`"A\r\n"`**`, B, C\r\n` <br/>

 After the improvement, the CSV sink should be:<br/>
  **`"A\n"`**`, B, C\r\n`<br/>

#### Scenario 4: Encounter an issue of incorrectly reading empty string as NULL
 
 You are affected if you are in the following conditions:
 - Using the Delimited Text as a source. 
 - NULL value is set to non-empty value. 
 - The column value is empty string and is unquoted. 
 
 Before the improvement, the column value of unquoted empty string is read as NULL. 

 After the improvement, empty string will not be parsed as NULL value. 
 
 The following example shows you one pipeline behavior change after the improvement:

 **Example**:<br/>

 For the following column:<br/>
  `A, ,B, `<br/>

 Before the improvement, the parsed column result is:<br/>
  `A null B null`<br/>

 After the improvement, the parsed column result should be:<br/>
  `A "" (empty string) B "" (empty string)`<br/>
