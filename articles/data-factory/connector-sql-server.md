# Copy data to and from SQL Server by using Azure Data Factory

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Azure Data Factory that you're using:"]
> * [Version 1](v1/data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md)
> * [Current version](connector-sql-server.md)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from and to a SQL Server database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of the copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This SQL Server connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)
- [GetMetadata activity](control-flow-get-metadata-activity.md)

You can copy data from a SQL Server database to any supported sink data store. Or, you can copy data from any supported source data store to a SQL Server database. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this SQL Server connector supports:

- SQL Server version 2005 and above.
- Copying data by using SQL or Windows authentication.
- As a source, retrieving data by using a SQL query or a stored procedure. You can also choose to parallel copy from SQL Server source, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section for details.
- As a sink, automatically creating destination table if not exists based on the source schema; appending data to a table or invoking a stored procedure with custom logic during copy. 

[SQL Server Express LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb) is not supported.

>[!NOTE]
>SQL Server [Always Encrypted](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine) isn't supported by this connector now. To work around, you can use a [generic ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) and a SQL Server ODBC driver. Follow [this guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/using-always-encrypted-with-the-odbc-driver) with ODBC driver download and connection string configurations.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](../../includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)]

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to the SQL Server database connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for the SQL Server linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **SqlServer**. | Yes |
| connectionString |Specify **connectionString** information that's needed to connect to the SQL Server database by using either SQL authentication or Windows authentication. Refer to the following samples.<br/>You also can put a password in Azure Key Vault. If it's SQL authentication, pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. For more information, see the JSON example following the table and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| userName |Specify a user name if you use Windows authentication. An example is **domainname\\username**. |No |
| password |Specify a password for the user account you specified for the user name. Mark this field as **SecureString** to store it securely in Azure Data Factory. Or, you can [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |No |
| connectVia | This [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) is used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, the default Azure integration runtime is used. |No |

>[!TIP]
>If you hit an error with the error code "UserErrorFailedToConnectToSqlServer" and a message like "The session limit for the database is XXX and has been reached," add `Pooling=false` to your connection string and try again.

**Example 1: Use SQL authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "SqlServerLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Data Source=<servername>\\<instance name if using named instance>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=False;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Use SQL authentication with a password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "SqlServerLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {

                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 3: Use Windows authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "SqlServerLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Data Source=<servername>\\<instance name if using named instance>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=True;",
            "userName": "<domain\\username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
     }
}
```

## Dataset properties

To copy data from and to a SQL Server database, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to **SqlServerTable**. | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No for source, Yes for sink  |
| table | Name of the table/view. |No for source, Yes for sink  |
| tableName | Name of the table/view with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. For new workload, use `schema` and `table`. | No for source, Yes for sink |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SQLServerDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<SQL Server linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "schema": [ < physical schema, optional, retrievable during authoring > ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "schema": "<schema_name>",
            "table": "<table_name>"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for use to define activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the SQL Server source and sink.

### SQL Server as a source

>[!TIP]
>To load data from SQL Server efficiently by using data partitioning, learn more from [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database).

To copy data from SQL Server, set the source type in the copy activity to **SqlSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity source section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **SqlSource**. | Yes |
| sqlReaderQuery |Use the custom SQL query to read data. An example is `select * from MyTable`. |No |
| sqlReaderStoredProcedureName |This property is the name of the stored procedure that reads data from the source table. The last SQL statement must be a SELECT statement in the stored procedure. |No |
| storedProcedureParameters |These parameters are for the stored procedure.<br/>Allowed values are name or value pairs. The names and casing of parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. |No |
| isolationLevel | Specifies the transaction locking behavior for the SQL source. The allowed values are: **ReadCommitted**, **ReadUncommitted**, **RepeatableRead**, **Serializable**, **Snapshot**. If not specified, the database's default isolation level is used. Refer to [this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.isolationlevel) for more details. | No |
| partitionOptions | Specifies the data partitioning options used to load data from SQL Server. <br>Allowed values are: **None** (default), **PhysicalPartitionsOfTable**, and **DynamicRange**.<br>When a partition option is enabled (that is, not `None`), the degree of parallelism to concurrently load data from SQL Server is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. | No |
| partitionSettings | Specify the group of the settings for data partitioning. <br>Apply when the partition option isn't `None`. | No |
| ***Under `partitionSettings`:*** | | |
| partitionColumnName | Specify the name of the source column **in integer or  date/datetime type** that will be used by range partitioning for parallel copy. If not specified, the index or the primary key of the table is auto-detected and used as the partition column.<br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook  `?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition ` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section. | No |
| partitionUpperBound | The maximum value of the partition column for partition range splitting. This value is used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table or query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value.  <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section. | No |
| partitionLowerBound | The minimum value of the partition column for partition range splitting. This value is used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table or query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value.<br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section. | No |

**Points to note:**

- If **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for **SqlSource**, the copy activity runs this query against the SQL Server source to get the data. You also can specify a stored procedure by specifying **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** if the stored procedure takes parameters.
- If you don't specify either **sqlReaderQuery** or **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName**, the columns defined in the "structure" section of the dataset JSON are used to construct a query. The query `select column1, column2 from mytable` runs against the SQL Server. If the dataset definition doesn't have "structure," all columns are selected from the table.

**Example: Use SQL query**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSQLServer",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<SQL Server input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SqlSource",
                "sqlReaderQuery": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**Example: Use a stored procedure**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSQLServer",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<SQL Server input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SqlSource",
                "sqlReaderStoredProcedureName": "CopyTestSrcStoredProcedureWithParameters",
                "storedProcedureParameters": {
                    "stringData": { "value": "str3" },
                    "identifier": { "value": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', <datetime parameter>)", "type": "Int"}
                }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**The stored procedure definition**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CopyTestSrcStoredProcedureWithParameters
(
    @stringData varchar(20),
    @identifier int
)
AS
SET NOCOUNT ON;
BEGIN
    select *
    from dbo.UnitTestSrcTable
    where dbo.UnitTestSrcTable.stringData != stringData
    and dbo.UnitTestSrcTable.identifier != identifier
END
GO
```

### SQL Server as a sink

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about the supported write behaviors, configurations, and best practices from [Best practice for loading data into SQL Server](#best-practice-for-loading-data-into-sql-server).

To copy data to SQL Server, set the sink type in the copy activity to **SqlSink**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity sink section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to **SqlSink**. | Yes |
| preCopyScript |This property specifies a SQL query for the copy activity to run before writing data into SQL Server. It's invoked only once per copy run. You can use this property to clean up the preloaded data. |No |
| tableOption | Specifies whether to [automatically create the sink table](copy-activity-overview.md#auto-create-sink-tables) if not exists based on the source schema. Auto table creation is not supported when sink specifies stored procedure. Allowed values are: `none` (default), `autoCreate`. |No |
| sqlWriterStoredProcedureName | The name of the stored procedure that defines how to apply source data into a target table. <br/>This stored procedure is *invoked per batch*. For operations that run only once and have nothing to do with source data, for example, delete or truncate, use the `preCopyScript` property.<br>See example from [Invoke a stored procedure from a SQL sink](#invoke-a-stored-procedure-from-a-sql-sink). | No |
| storedProcedureTableTypeParameterName |The parameter name of the table type specified in the stored procedure.  |No |
| sqlWriterTableType |The table type name to be used in the stored procedure. The copy activity makes the data being moved available in a temp table with this table type. Stored procedure code can then merge the data that's being copied with existing data. |No |
| storedProcedureParameters |Parameters for the stored procedure.<br/>Allowed values are name and value pairs. Names and casing of parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. | No |
| writeBatchSize |Number of rows to insert into the SQL table *per batch*.<br/>Allowed values are integers for the number of rows. By default, Azure Data Factory dynamically determines the appropriate batch size based on the row size. |No |
| writeBatchTimeout |This property specifies the wait time for the batch insert operation to complete before it times out.<br/>Allowed values are for the timespan. An example is “00:30:00” for 30 minutes. If no value is specified, the timeout defaults to "02:00:00". |No |

**Example 1: Append data**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToSQLServer",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<SQL Server output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "SqlSink",
                "tableOption": "autoCreate",
                "writeBatchSize": 100000
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Parallel copy from SQL database

The SQL Server connector in copy activity provides built-in data partitioning to copy data in parallel. You can find data partitioning options on the **Source** tab of the copy activity.

![Screenshot of partition options](./media/connector-sql-server/connector-sql-partition-options.png)

When you enable partitioned copy, copy activity runs parallel queries against your SQL Server source to load data by partitions. The parallel degree is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. For example, if you set `parallelCopies` to four, Data Factory concurrently generates and runs four queries based on your specified partition option and settings, and each query retrieves a portion of data from your SQL Server.

You are suggested to enable parallel copy with data partitioning especially when you load large amount of data from your SQL Server. The following are suggested configurations for different scenarios. When copying data into file-based data store, it's recommended to write to a folder as multiple files (only specify folder name), in which case the performance is better than writing to a single file.

| Scenario                                                     | Suggested settings                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full load from large table, with physical partitions.        | **Partition option**: Physical partitions of table. <br><br/>During execution, Data Factory automatically detects the physical partitions, and copies data by partitions. <br><br/>To check if your table has physical partition or not, you can refer to [this query](#sample-query-to-check-physical-partition). |
| Full load from large table, without physical partitions, while with an integer or datetime column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Partition column** (optional): Specify the column used to partition data. If not specified, the index or primary key column is used.<br/>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound** (optional): Specify if you want to determine the partition stride. This is not for filtering the rows in table, all rows in the table will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the values.<br><br>For example, if your partition column "ID" has values range from 1 to 100, and you set the lower bound as 20 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy as 4, Data Factory retrieves data by 4 partitions - IDs in range <=20, [21, 50], [51, 80], and >=81, respectively. |
| Load a large amount of data by using a custom query, without physical partitions, while with an integer or date/datetime column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data.<br>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound** (optional): Specify if you want to determine the partition stride. This is not for filtering the rows in table, all rows in the query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value.<br><br>During execution, Data Factory replaces `?AdfRangePartitionColumnName` with the actual column name and value ranges for each partition, and sends to SQL Server. <br>For example, if your partition column "ID" has values range from 1 to 100, and you set the lower bound as 20 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy as 4, Data Factory retrieves data by 4 partitions- IDs in range <=20, [21, 50], [51, 80], and >=81, respectively. <br><br>Here are more sample queries for different scenarios:<br> 1. Query the whole table: <br>`SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition`<br> 2. Query from a table with column selection and additional where-clause filters: <br>`SELECT <column_list> FROM <TableName> WHERE ?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`<br> 3. Query with subqueries: <br>`SELECT <column_list> FROM (<your_sub_query>) AS T WHERE ?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`<br> 4. Query with partition in subquery: <br>`SELECT <column_list> FROM (SELECT <your_sub_query_column_list> FROM <TableName> WHERE ?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition) AS T`
|

Best practices to load data with partition option:

1. Choose distinctive column as partition column (like primary key or unique key) to avoid data skew. 
2. If the table has built-in partition, use partition option "Physical partitions of table" to get better performance.	
3. If you use Azure Integration Runtime to copy data, you can set larger "[Data Integration Units (DIU)](copy-activity-performance-features.md#data-integration-units)" (>4) to utilize more computing resource. Check the applicable scenarios there.
4. "[Degree of copy parallelism](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy)" control the partition numbers, setting this number too large sometime hurts the performance, recommend setting this number as (DIU or number of Self-hosted IR nodes) * (2 to 4).

**Example: full load from large table with physical partitions**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "SqlSource",
    "partitionOption": "PhysicalPartitionsOfTable"
}
```

**Example: query with dynamic range partition**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "SqlSource",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?AdfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>",
    "partitionOption": "DynamicRange",
    "partitionSettings": {
        "partitionColumnName": "<partition_column_name>",
        "partitionUpperBound": "<upper_value_of_partition_column (optional) to decide the partition stride, not as data filter>",
        "partitionLowerBound": "<lower_value_of_partition_column (optional) to decide the partition stride, not as data filter>"
    }
}
```

### Sample query to check physical partition

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.name AS SchemaName, t.name AS TableName, pf.name AS PartitionFunctionName, c.name AS ColumnName, iif(pf.name is null, 'no', 'yes') AS HasPartition
FROM sys.tables AS t
LEFT JOIN sys.objects AS o ON t.object_id = o.object_id
LEFT JOIN sys.schemas AS s ON o.schema_id = s.schema_id
LEFT JOIN sys.indexes AS i ON t.object_id = i.object_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.index_columns AS ic ON ic.partition_ordinal > 0 AND ic.index_id = i.index_id AND ic.object_id = t.object_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.columns AS c ON c.object_id = ic.object_id AND c.column_id = ic.column_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_schemes ps ON i.data_space_id = ps.data_space_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_functions pf ON pf.function_id = ps.function_id 
WHERE s.name='[your schema]' AND t.name = '[your table name]'
```

If the table has physical partition, you would see "HasPartition" as "yes" like the following.

## Best practice for loading data into SQL Server

When you copy data into SQL Server, you might require different write behavior:

- [Append](#append-data): My source data has only new records.
- [Upsert](#upsert-data): My source data has both inserts and updates.
- [Overwrite](#overwrite-the-entire-table): I want to reload the entire dimension table each time.
- [Write with custom logic](#write-data-with-custom-logic): I need extra processing before the final insertion into the destination table.

See the respective sections for how to configure in Azure Data Factory and best practices.

### Append data

Appending data is the default behavior of this SQL Server sink connector. Azure Data Factory does a bulk insert to write to your table efficiently. You can configure the source and sink accordingly in the copy activity.

### Upsert data

**Option 1:** When you have a large amount of data to copy, you can bulk load all records into a staging table by using the copy activity, then run a stored procedure activity to apply a [MERGE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql) or INSERT/UPDATE statement in one shot. 

Copy activity currently doesn't natively support loading data into a database temporary table. There is an advanced way to set it up with a combination of multiple activities, refer to [Optimize SQL Database Bulk Upsert scenarios](https://github.com/scoriani/azuresqlbulkupsert). Below shows a sample of using a permanent table as staging.

As an example, in Azure Data Factory, you can create a pipeline with a **Copy activity** chained with a **Stored Procedure activity**. The former copies data from your source store into a SQL Server staging table, for example, **UpsertStagingTable**, as the table name in the dataset. Then the latter invokes a stored procedure to merge source data from the staging table into the target table and clean up the staging table.

![Upsert](./media/connector-azure-sql-database/azure-sql-database-upsert.png)

In your database, define a stored procedure with MERGE logic, like the following example, which is pointed to from the previous stored procedure activity. Assume that the target is the **Marketing** table with three columns: **ProfileID**, **State**, and **Category**. Do the upsert based on the **ProfileID** column.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[spMergeData]
AS
BEGIN
	MERGE TargetTable AS target
	USING UpsertStagingTable AS source
	ON (target.[ProfileID] = source.[ProfileID])
	WHEN MATCHED THEN
		UPDATE SET State = source.State
    WHEN NOT matched THEN
    	INSERT ([ProfileID], [State], [Category])
      VALUES (source.ProfileID, source.State, source.Category);
    
    TRUNCATE TABLE UpsertStagingTable
END
```

**Option 2:** You can choose to [invoke a stored procedure within the copy activity](#invoke-a-stored-procedure-from-a-sql-sink). This approach runs each batch (as governed by the `writeBatchSize` property) in the source table instead of using bulk insert as the default approach in the copy activity.

### Overwrite the entire table

You can configure the **preCopyScript** property in a copy activity sink. In this case, for each copy activity that runs, Azure Data Factory runs the script first. Then it runs the copy to insert the data. For example, to overwrite the entire table with the latest data, specify a script to first delete all the records before you bulk load the new data from the source.

### Write data with custom logic

The steps to write data with custom logic are similar to those described in the [Upsert data](#upsert-data) section. When you need to apply extra processing before the final insertion of source data into the destination table, you can load to a staging table then invoke stored procedure activity, or invoke a stored procedure in copy activity sink to apply data.

## <a name="invoke-a-stored-procedure-from-a-sql-sink"></a> Invoke a stored procedure from a SQL sink

When you copy data into SQL Server database, you also can configure and invoke a user-specified stored procedure with additional parameters on each batch of the source table. The stored procedure feature takes advantage of [table-valued parameters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb675163.aspx).

You can use a stored procedure when built-in copy mechanisms don't serve the purpose. An example is when you want to apply extra processing before the final insertion of source data into the destination table. Some extra processing examples are when you want to merge columns, look up additional values, and insert into more than one table.

The following sample shows how to use a stored procedure to do an upsert into a table in the SQL Server database. Assume that the input data and the sink **Marketing** table each have three columns: **ProfileID**, **State**, and **Category**. Do the upsert based on the **ProfileID** column, and only apply it for a specific category called "ProductA".

1. In your database, define the table type with the same name as **sqlWriterTableType**. The schema of the table type is the same as the schema returned by your input data.

    ```sql
    CREATE TYPE [dbo].[MarketingType] AS TABLE(
        [ProfileID] [varchar](256) NOT NULL,
        [State] [varchar](256) NOT NULL,
        [Category] [varchar](256) NOT NULL
    )
    ```

2. In your database, define the stored procedure with the same name as **sqlWriterStoredProcedureName**. It handles input data from your specified source and merges into the output table. The parameter name of the table type in the stored procedure is the same as **tableName** defined in the dataset.

    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE spOverwriteMarketing @Marketing [dbo].[MarketingType] READONLY, @category varchar(256)
    AS
    BEGIN
    MERGE [dbo].[Marketing] AS target
    USING @Marketing AS source
    ON (target.ProfileID = source.ProfileID and target.Category = @category)
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET State = source.State
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (ProfileID, State, Category)
        VALUES (source.ProfileID, source.State, source.Category);
    END
    ```

3. In Azure Data Factory, define the **SQL sink** section in the copy activity as follows:

    ```json
    "sink": {
        "type": "SqlSink",
        "sqlWriterStoredProcedureName": "spOverwriteMarketing",
        "storedProcedureTableTypeParameterName": "Marketing",
        "sqlWriterTableType": "MarketingType",
        "storedProcedureParameters": {
            "category": {
                "value": "ProductA"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Data type mapping for SQL Server

When you copy data from and to SQL Server, the following mappings are used from SQL Server data types to Azure Data Factory interim data types. To learn how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| SQL Server data type | Azure Data Factory interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| bigint |Int64 |
| binary |Byte[] |
| bit |Boolean |
| char |String, Char[] |
| date |DateTime |
| Datetime |DateTime |
| datetime2 |DateTime |
| Datetimeoffset |DateTimeOffset |
| Decimal |Decimal |
| FILESTREAM attribute (varbinary(max)) |Byte[] |
| Float |Double |
| image |Byte[] |
| int |Int32 |
| money |Decimal |
| nchar |String, Char[] |
| ntext |String, Char[] |
| numeric |Decimal |
| nvarchar |String, Char[] |
| real |Single |
| rowversion |Byte[] |
| smalldatetime |DateTime |
| smallint |Int16 |
| smallmoney |Decimal |
| sql_variant |Object |
| text |String, Char[] |
| time |TimeSpan |
| timestamp |Byte[] |
| tinyint |Int16 |
| uniqueidentifier |Guid |
| varbinary |Byte[] |
| varchar |String, Char[] |
| xml |String |

>[!NOTE]
> For data types that map to the Decimal interim type, currently Copy activity supports precision up to 28. If you have data that requires precision larger than 28, consider converting to a string in a SQL query.

## Using Always Encrypted

When you copy data from/to SQL Server with [Always Encrypted](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine), use [generic ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) and SQL Server ODBC driver via Self-hosted Integration Runtime. This SQL Server connector does not support Always Encrypted now. 

More specifically:

1. Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime if you don't have one. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.

2. Download the 64-bit ODBC driver for SQL Server from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server), and install on the Integration Runtime machine. Learn more about how this driver works from [Using Always Encrypted with the ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/using-always-encrypted-with-the-odbc-driver#using-the-azure-key-vault-provider).

3. Create linked service with ODBC type to connect to your SQL database. To use SQL authentication, specify the ODBC connection string as below, and select **Basic** authentication to set the user name and password.

    ```
    Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=<serverName>;Database=<databaseName>;ColumnEncryption=Enabled;KeyStoreAuthentication=KeyVaultClientSecret;KeyStorePrincipalId=<servicePrincipalKey>;KeyStoreSecret=<servicePrincipalKey>
    ```

4. Create dataset and copy activity with ODBC type accordingly. Learn more from [ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) article.

## Troubleshoot connection issues

1. Configure your SQL Server instance to accept remote connections. Start **SQL Server Management Studio**, right-click **server**, and select **Properties**. Select **Connections** from the list, and select the **Allow remote connections to this server** check box.

    ![Enable remote connections](media/copy-data-to-from-sql-server/AllowRemoteConnections.png)

    For detailed steps, see [Configure the remote access server configuration option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191464.aspx).

2. Start **SQL Server Configuration Manager**. Expand **SQL Server Network Configuration** for the instance you want, and select **Protocols for MSSQLSERVER**. Protocols appear in the right pane. Enable TCP/IP by right-clicking **TCP/IP** and selecting **Enable**.

    ![Enable TCP/IP](./media/copy-data-to-from-sql-server/EnableTCPProptocol.png)

    For more information and alternate ways of enabling TCP/IP protocol, see [Enable or disable a server network protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191294.aspx).

3. In the same window, double-click **TCP/IP** to launch the **TCP/IP Properties** window.
4. Switch to the **IP Addresses** tab. Scroll down to see the **IPAll** section. Write down the **TCP Port**. The default is **1433**.
5. Create a **rule for the Windows Firewall** on the machine to allow incoming traffic through this port. 
6. **Verify connection**: To connect to SQL Server by using a fully qualified name, use SQL Server Management Studio from a different machine. An example is `"<machine>.<domain>.corp.<company>.com,1433"`.
