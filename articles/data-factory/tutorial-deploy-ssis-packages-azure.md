# Provision the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory

This tutorial provides steps for using the Azure portal to provision an Azure-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory (ADF). Azure-SSIS IR supports running packages deployed into SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL Database server/Managed Instance (Project Deployment Model) and those deployed into file systems/file shares/Azure Files (Package Deployment Model). Once Azure-SSIS IR is provisioned, you can then use familiar tools, such as SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)/SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and command line utilities, such as `dtinstall`/`dtutil`/`dtexec`, to deploy and run your packages in Azure. For conceptual information on Azure-SSIS IRs, see [Azure-SSIS integration runtime overview](concepts-integration-runtime.md#azure-ssis-integration-runtime).

In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a data factory.
> * Provision an Azure-SSIS integration runtime.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

- **Azure subscription**. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- **Azure SQL Database server (optional)**. If you do not already have a database server, create one in the Azure portal before you get started. ADF will in turn create SSISDB on this database server. We recommend that you create the database server in the same Azure region as the integration runtime. This configuration lets the integration runtime write execution logs into SSISDB without crossing Azure regions. 
    - Based on the selected database server, SSISDB can be created on your behalf as a single database, part of an elastic pool, or in a Managed Instance and accessible in public network or by joining a virtual network. For guidance in choosing the type of database server to host SSISDB, see [Compare Azure SQL Database single database/elastic pool/Managed Instance](../data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md#compare-sql-database-single-databaseelastic-pool-and-sql-database-managed-instance). If you use Azure SQL Database server with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance with a private endpoint to host SSISDB or require access to on-premises data without configuring Self-Hosted IR, you need to join your Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR in a virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime).
    - Confirm that the **Allow access to Azure services** setting is enabled for the database server. This is not applicable when you use Azure SQL Database server with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance with a private endpoint to host SSISDB. For more information, see [Secure your Azure SQL database](../sql-database/sql-database-security-tutorial.md#create-firewall-rules). To enable this setting by using PowerShell, see [New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule](/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqlserverfirewallrule).
    - Add the IP address of client machine, or a range of IP addresses that includes the IP address of client machine, to the client IP address list in the firewall settings for the database server. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database server-level and database-level firewall rules](../sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure.md).
    - You can connect to the database server using SQL authentication with your server admin credentials or Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication with the managed identity for your ADF. For the latter, you need to add the managed identity for your ADF into an AAD group with access permissions to the database server, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR with AAD authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime).
    - Confirm that your database server does not have an SSISDB already. The provisioning of an Azure-SSIS IR does not support using an existing SSISDB.

> [!NOTE]
> - For a list of Azure regions in which ADF and Azure-SSIS IR are currently available, see [ADF + SSIS IR availability by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=data-factory&regions=all). 

## Create a data factory

To create your ADF via Azure portal, follow the step-by-step instructions in [Create ADF via UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal#create-a-data-factory) article and select **Pin to dashboard** while doing so to allow quick access after its creation. 

Once your ADF is created, open its overview page on Azure portal and click on the **Author & Monitor** tile to launch its **Let's get started** page on a separate tab where you can continue to create your Azure-SSIS IR.

On **Create SSIS catalog...** checkbox, select the deployment model for packages to run on your Azure-SSIS IR: Project Deployment Model where packages are deployed into SSISDB hosted by your database server or Package Deployment Model where packages are deployed into your file systems/file shares/Azure Files. If you check it, you will need to bring your own database server to host SSISDB that we will create and manage on your behalf.
   
   b. For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription that has your database server to host SSISDB. 

   c. For **Location**, select the location of your database server to host SSISDB. We recommend that you select the same location of your integration runtime.

   d. For **Catalog Database Server Endpoint**, select the endpoint of your database server to host SSISDB. Based on the selected database server, SSISDB can be created on your behalf as a single database, part of an elastic pool, or in a Managed Instance and accessible in public network or by joining a virtual network. For guidance in choosing the type of database server to host SSISDB, see [Compare Azure SQL Database single database/elastic pool/Managed Instance](../data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md#compare-sql-database-single-databaseelastic-pool-and-sql-database-managed-instance). If you select Azure SQL Database server with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance with a private endpoint to host SSISDB or require access to on-premises data without configuring Self-Hosted IR, you need to join your Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR in a virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime). 

   e. On **Use AAD authentication...** checkbox, select the authentication method for your database server to host SSISDB: SQL authentication or AAD authentication with the managed identity for your ADF. If you check it, you need to add the managed identity for your ADF into an AAD group with access permissions to your database server, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR with AAD authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime). 

   f. For **Admin Username**, enter SQL authentication username for your database server to host SSISDB.

   h. For **Catalog Database Service Tier**, select the service tier for your database server to host SSISDB: Basic/Standard/Premium tier or elastic pool name.

   i. Click **Test Connection** and if successful, click **Next**. 

1. On the **Advanced Settings** page, complete the following steps: 

   ![Advanced settings](./media/tutorial-create-azure-ssis-runtime-portal/advanced-settings.png)

   a. For **Maximum Parallel Executions Per Node**, select the maximum number of packages to execute concurrently per node in your integration runtime cluster. Only supported package numbers are displayed. Select a low number, if you want to use more than one cores to run a single large/heavy-weight package that is compute/memory -intensive. Select a high number, if you want to run one or more small/light-weight packages in a single core. 

   b. For **Custom Setup Container SAS URI**, optionally enter Shared Access Signature (SAS) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of your Azure Storage Blob container where your setup script and its associated files are stored, see [Custom setup for Azure-SSIS IR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup). 

   c. On **Select a VNet...** checkbox, select whether you want to join your integration runtime to a virtual network. You should check it if you use Azure SQL Database server with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance with a private endpoint to host SSISDB or require access to on-premises data without configuring Self-Hosted IR, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR in a virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime). 

   d. On **Set up Self-Hosted...** checkbox, select whether you want to configure Self-Hosted IR as a proxy for your Azure-SSIS IR, see [Set up Self-Hosted IR as a proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-proxy-ssis). 

1. Click **Next**. 

1. On the **Summary** page, review all provisioning settings, bookmark the recommended documentation links, and click **Finish** to start the creation of your integration runtime. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Excluding any custom setup time, this process should be completed within 5 minutes.
   >
   > If you use SSISDB, ADF service will connect to your database server to prepare SSISDB. 
   > 
   > When you provision an Azure-SSIS IR, Access Redistributable and Azure Feature Pack for SSIS are also installed. These components provide connectivity to Excel/Access files and various Azure data sources, in addition to the data sources already supported by built-in components. You can also install additional components, see [Custom setup for Azure-SSIS IR](how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup.md).

1. On the **Connections** tab, switch to **Integration Runtimes** if needed. Select **Refresh** to refresh the status. 

   ![Creation status, with "Refresh" button](./media/tutorial-create-azure-ssis-runtime-portal/azure-ssis-ir-creation-status.png)

1. Use the links in the **Actions** column to stop/start, edit, or delete the integration runtime. Use the last link to view JSON code for the integration runtime. The edit and delete buttons are enabled only when the IR is stopped. 

   ![Links in the "Actions" column](./media/tutorial-create-azure-ssis-runtime-portal/azure-ssis-ir-actions.png) 

## Deploy SSIS packages

If you use SSISDB, you can deploy your packages into it and run them on Azure-SSIS IR using SSDT/SSMS tools that connect to your database server via its server endpoint. For Azure SQL Database server/Managed instance with a public endpoint, the server endpoint format is `<server name>.database.windows.net`/`<server name>.public.<dns prefix>.database.windows.net,3342`, respectively. If you do not use SSISDB, you can deploy your packages into file systems/file shares/Azure Files and run them on Azure-SSIS IR using `dtinstall`/`dtutil`/`dtexec` command line utilities. For more information, see [Deploy SSIS packages](/sql/integration-services/packages/deploy-integration-services-ssis-projects-and-packages#deploy-packages-to-integration-services-server). In both cases, you can also run your deployed packages on Azure-SSIS IR using Execute SSIS Package activity in ADF pipelines, see [Invoke SSIS package execution as a first-class ADF activity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/how-to-invoke-ssis-package-ssis-activity).
