# Copy data to or from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 using Azure Data Factory

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Azure Data Factory that you're using:"]
> * [Version 1](v1/data-factory-azure-datalake-connector.md)
> * [Current version](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md)

This article outlines how to copy data to and from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. To learn about Azure Data Factory, read the [introductory article](introduction.md).

## Supported capabilities

This Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md) 
- [Mapping data flow](concepts-data-flow-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)
- [GetMetadata activity](control-flow-get-metadata-activity.md)
- [Delete activity](delete-activity.md)

Specifically, with this connector you can:

- Copy files by using one of the following methods of authentication: service principal or managed identities for Azure resources.
- Copy files as is or parse or generate files with the [supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md).
- [Preserve ACLs](#preserve-acls-to-data-lake-storage-gen2) when copying into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you copy data by using the self-hosted integration runtime, configure the corporate firewall to allow outbound traffic to `<ADLS account name>.azuredatalakestore.net` and `login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/token` on port 443. The latter is the Azure Security Token Service that the integration runtime needs to communicate with to get the access token.

## Get started

> [!TIP]
> For a walk-through of how to use the Azure Data Lake Store connector, see [Load data into Azure Data Lake Store](load-azure-data-lake-store.md).

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide information about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Azure Data Lake Store.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for the Azure Data Lake Store linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The `type` property must be set to **AzureDataLakeStore**. | Yes |
| dataLakeStoreUri | Information about the Azure Data Lake Store account. This information takes one of the following formats: `https://[accountname].azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1` or `adl://[accountname].azuredatalakestore.net/`. | Yes |
| subscriptionId | The Azure subscription ID to which the Data Lake Store account belongs. | Required for sink |
| resourceGroupName | The Azure resource group name to which the Data Lake Store account belongs. | Required for sink |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use the Azure integration runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime if your data store is located in a private network. If this property isn't specified, the default Azure integration runtime is used. |No |

### Use service principal authentication

To use service principal authentication, follow these steps.

1. Register an application entity in Azure Active Directory and grant it access to Data Lake Store. For detailed steps, see [Service-to-service authentication](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-authenticate-using-active-directory.md). Make note of the following values, which you use to define the linked service:

    - Application ID
    - Application key
    - Tenant ID

2. Grant the service principal proper permission. See examples on how permission works in Data Lake Storage Gen1 from [Access control in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-access-control.md#common-scenarios-related-to-permissions).

    - **As source**: In **Data explorer** > **Access**, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders including the root, along with **Read** permission for the files to copy. You can choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive, and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. There's no requirement on account-level access control (IAM).
    - **As sink**: In **Data explorer** > **Access**, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders including the root, along with **Write** permission for the sink folder. You can choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive, and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. If you use an Azure integration runtime to copy (both source and sink are in the cloud), in IAM, grant at least the **Reader** role in order to let Data Factory detect the region for Data Lake Store. If you want to avoid this IAM role, explicitly [create an Azure integration runtime](create-azure-integration-runtime.md#create-azure-ir) with the location of Data Lake Store. For example, if your Data Lake Store is in West Europe, create an Azure integration runtime with location set to "West Europe." Associate them in the Data Lake Store linked service as shown in the following example.

The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| servicePrincipalId | Specify the application's client ID. | Yes |
| servicePrincipalKey | Specify the application's key. Mark this field as a `SecureString` to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| tenant | Specify the tenant information, such as domain name or tenant ID, under which your application resides. You can retrieve it by hovering the mouse in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataLakeStore",
        "typeProperties": {
            "dataLakeStoreUri": "https://<accountname>.azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1",
            "servicePrincipalId": "<service principal id>",
            "servicePrincipalKey": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<service principal key>"
            },
            "tenant": "<tenant info, e.g. microsoft.onmicrosoft.com>",
            "subscriptionId": "<subscription of ADLS>",
            "resourceGroupName": "<resource group of ADLS>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

### <a name="managed-identity"></a> Use managed identities for Azure resources authentication

A data factory can be associated with a [managed identity for Azure resources](data-factory-service-identity.md), which represents this specific data factory. You can directly use this managed identity for Data Lake Store authentication, similar to using your own service principal. It allows this designated factory to access and copy data to or from Data Lake Store.

To use managed identities for Azure resources authentication, follow these steps.

1. [Retrieve the data factory managed identity information](data-factory-service-identity.md#retrieve-managed-identity) by copying the value of the "Service Identity Application ID" generated along with your factory.

2. Grant the managed identity access to Data Lake Store. See examples on how permission works in Data Lake Storage Gen1 from [Access control in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-access-control.md#common-scenarios-related-to-permissions).

    - **As source**: In **Data explorer** > **Access**, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders including the root, along with **Read** permission for the files to copy. You can choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive, and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. There's no requirement on account-level access control (IAM).
    - **As sink**: In **Data explorer** > **Access**, grant at least **Execute** permission for ALL upstream folders including the root, along with **Write** permission for the sink folder. You can choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive, and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. If you use an Azure integration runtime to copy (both source and sink are in the cloud), in IAM, grant at least the **Reader** role in order to let Data Factory detect the region for Data Lake Store. If you want to avoid this IAM role, explicitly [create an Azure integration runtime](create-azure-integration-runtime.md#create-azure-ir) with the location of Data Lake Store. Associate them in the Data Lake Store linked service as shown in the following example.

In Azure Data Factory, you don't need to specify any properties besides the general Data Lake Store information in the linked service.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataLakeStore",
        "typeProperties": {
            "dataLakeStoreUri": "https://<accountname>.azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1",
            "subscriptionId": "<subscription of ADLS>",
            "resourceGroupName": "<resource group of ADLS>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md). This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Data Lake Store source and sink.

### Azure Data Lake Store as source

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-file-formats](../../includes/data-factory-v2-file-formats.md)] 

The following properties are supported for Azure Data Lake Store Gen1 under `storeSettings` settings in the format-based copy source:

| Property                 | Description                                                  | Required                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| type                     | The type property under `storeSettings` must be set to **AzureDataLakeStoreReadSettings**. | Yes                                           |
| recursive                | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. When recursive is set to true and the sink is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the sink. Allowed values are **true** (default) and **false**. | No                                            |
| wildcardFolderPath       | The folder path with wildcard characters to filter source folders. <br>Allowed wildcards are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has a wildcard or this escape char inside. <br>See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). | No                                            |
| wildcardFileName         | The file name with wildcard characters under the given folderPath/wildcardFolderPath to filter source files. <br>Allowed wildcards are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has a wildcard or this escape char inside. See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). | Yes if `fileName` isn't specified in dataset |
| modifiedDatetimeStart    | Files filter based on the attribute Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is within the time range between `modifiedDatetimeStart` and `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to the UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset. When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal to the datetime value are selected. When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected. | No                                            |
| modifiedDatetimeEnd      | Same as above.                                               | No                                            |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to storage store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No                                            |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromADLSGen1",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Delimited text input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {

                    "wildcardFileName": "*.csv"
                }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }

| type                     | The type property under `storeSettings` must be set to **AzureDataLakeStoreWriteSettings**. | Yes      |
| copyBehavior             | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of the source file to the source folder is identical to the relative path of the target file to the target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the target folder. The target files have autogenerated names. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an autogenerated file name. | No       |
| expiryDateTime | Specifies the expiry time of the written files. The time is applied to the UTC time in the format of "2020-03-01T08:00:00Z". By default it is NULL, which means the written files are never expired. | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to the data store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No       |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToADLSGen1",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {

                    "copyBehavior": "PreserveHierarchy"
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Folder and file filter examples

This section describes the resulting behavior of the folder path and file name with wildcard filters.

| folderPath | fileName | recursive | Source folder structure and filter result (files in **bold** are retrieved)|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `Folder*` | (Empty, use default) | false | FolderA<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**File1.csv**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**File2.json**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subfolder1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File3.csv<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File4.json<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File5.csv<br/>AnotherFolderB<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File6.csv |

## Preserve ACLs to Data Lake Storage Gen2

>[!TIP]
>To copy data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 into Gen2 in general, see [Copy data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Gen2 with Azure Data Factory](load-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-from-gen1.md) for a walk-through and best practices.

If you want to replicate the access control lists (ACLs) along with data files when you upgrade from Data Lake Storage Gen1 to Data Lake Storage Gen2, see [Preserve ACLs from Data Lake Storage Gen1](copy-activity-preserve-metadata.md#preserve-acls).

## Mapping data flow properties

When transforming data in mapping data flow, you can read and write files from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 in JSON, Avro, Delimited Text, or Parquet format. For more information, see [source transformation](data-flow-source.md) and [sink transformation](data-flow-sink.md) in the mapping data flow feature.

### Source transformation

In the source transformation, you can read from a container, folder or individual file in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. The **Source options** tab lets you manage how the files get read. 

![Source options](media/data-flow/sourceOptions1.png "Source options")

**Wildcard path:** Using a wildcard pattern will instruct ADF to loop through each matching folder and file in a single Source transformation. This is an effective way to process multiple files within a single flow. Add multiple wildcard matching patterns with the + sign that appears when hovering over your existing wildcard pattern.

From your source container, choose a series of files that match a pattern. Only container can be specified in the dataset. Your wildcard path must therefore also include your folder path from the root folder.

Wildcard examples:

* ```*``` Represents any set of characters
* ```**``` Represents recursive directory nesting
* ```?``` Replaces one character
* ```[]``` Matches one of more characters in the brackets

* ```/data/sales/**/*.csv``` Gets all csv files under /data/sales
* ```/data/sales/20??/**/``` Gets all files in the 20th century
* ```/data/sales/*/*/*.csv``` Gets csv files two levels under /data/sales
* ```/data/sales/2004/*/12/[XY]1?.csv``` Gets all csv files in 2004 in December starting with X or Y prefixed by a two-digit number

**Partition Root Path:** If you have partitioned folders in your file source with  a ```key=value``` format (for example, year=2019), then you can assign the top level of that partition folder tree to a column name in your data flow data stream.

First, set a wildcard to include all paths that are the partitioned folders plus the leaf files that you wish to read.

![Partition source file settings](media/data-flow/partfile2.png "Partition file setting")

Use the Partition Root Path setting to define what the top level of the folder structure is. When you view the contents of your data via a data preview, you'll see that ADF will add the resolved partitions found in each of your folder levels.

![Partition root path](media/data-flow/partfile1.png "Partition root path preview")

**List of files:** This is a file set. Create a text file that includes a list of relative path files to process. Point to this text file.

**Column to store file name:** Store the name of the source file in a column in your data. Enter a new column name here to store the file name string.

**After completion:** Choose to do nothing with the source file after the data flow runs, delete the source file, or move the source file. The paths for the move are relative.

To move source files to another location post-processing, first select "Move" for file operation. Then, set the "from" directory. If you're not using any wildcards for your path, then the "from" setting will be the same folder as your source folder.

If you have a source path with wildcard, your syntax will look like this below:

```/data/sales/20??/**/*.csv```

You can specify "from" as

```/data/sales```

And "to" as

```/backup/priorSales```

In this case, all files that were sourced under /data/sales are moved to /backup/priorSales.

> [!NOTE]
> File operations run only when you start the data flow from a pipeline run (a pipeline debug or execution run) that uses the Execute Data Flow activity in a pipeline. File operations *do not* run in Data Flow debug mode.

**Filter by last modified:** You can filter which files you process by specifying a date range of when they were last modified. All date-times are in UTC. 

### Sink properties

In the sink transformation, you can write to either a container or folder in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. the **Settings** tab lets you manage how the files get written.

![sink options](media/data-flow/file-sink-settings.png "sink options")

**Clear the folder:** Determines whether or not the destination folder gets cleared before the data is written.

**File name option:** Determines how the destination files are named in the destination folder. The file name options are:
   * **Default**: Allow Spark to name files based on PART defaults.
   * **Pattern**: Enter a pattern that enumerates your output files per partition. For example, **loans[n].csv** will create loans1.csv, loans2.csv, and so on.
   * **Per partition**: Enter one file name per partition.
   * **As data in column**: Set the output file to the value of a column. The path is relative to the dataset container, not the destination folder.
   * **Output to a single file**: Combine the partitioned output files into a single named file. The path is relative to the dataset folder. Please be aware that te merge operation can possibly fail based upon node size. This option is not recommended for large datasets.

**Quote all:** Determines whether to enclose all values in quotes

## Legacy models

>[!NOTE]
>The following models are still supported as-is for backward compatibility. You are suggested to use the new model mentioned in above sections going forward, and the ADF authoring UI has switched to generating the new model.

### Legacy dataset model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to **AzureDataLakeStoreFile**. |Yes |
| folderPath | Path to the folder in Data Lake Store. If not specified, it points to the root. <br/><br/>Wildcard filter is supported. Allowed wildcards are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has a wildcard or this escape char inside. <br/><br/>For example: rootfolder/subfolder/. See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). |No |
| fileName | Name or wildcard filter for the files under the specified "folderPath". If you don't specify a value for this property, the dataset points to all files in the folder. <br/><br/>For filter, the wildcards allowed are `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character).<br/>- Example 1: `"fileName": "*.csv"`<br/>- Example 2: `"fileName": "???20180427.txt"`<br/>Use `^` to escape if your actual file name has a wildcard or this escape char inside.<br/><br/>When fileName isn't specified for an output dataset and **preserveHierarchy** isn't specified in the activity sink, the copy activity automatically generates the file name with the following pattern: "*Data.[activity run ID GUID].[GUID if FlattenHierarchy].[format if configured].[compression if configured]*", for example, "Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt.gz". If you copy from a tabular source by using a table name instead of a query, the name pattern is "*[table name].[format].[compression if configured]*", for example, "MyTable.csv". |No |
| modifiedDatetimeStart | Files filter based on the attribute Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is within the time range between `modifiedDatetimeStart` and `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to the UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br/><br/> The overall performance of data movement is affected by enabling this setting when you want to do file filter with huge amounts of files. <br/><br/> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset. When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal to the datetime value are selected. When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected.| No |
| modifiedDatetimeEnd | Files filter based on the attribute Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is within the time range between `modifiedDatetimeStart` and `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to the UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br/><br/> The overall performance of data movement is affected by enabling this setting when you want to do file filter with huge amounts of files. <br/><br/> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset. When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal to the datetime value are selected. When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has a datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected.| No |
| format | If you want to copy files as is between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both input and output dataset definitions.<br/><br/>If you want to parse or generate files with a specific format, the following file format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, and **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under **format** to one of these values. For more information, see the [Text format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#text-format), [JSON format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#json-format), [Avro format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#avro-format), [Orc format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#orc-format), and [Parquet format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#parquet-format) sections. |No (only for binary copy scenario) |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. For more information, see [Supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#compression-support).<br/>Supported types are **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**.<br/>Supported levels are **Optimal** and **Fastest**. |No |

>[!TIP]
>To copy all files under a folder, specify **folderPath** only.<br>To copy a single file with a particular name, specify **folderPath** with a folder part and **fileName** with a file name.<br>To copy a subset of files under a folder, specify **folderPath** with a folder part and **fileName** with a wildcard filter. 

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "ADLSDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataLakeStoreFile",
        "linkedServiceName":{
            "referenceName": "<ADLS linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "datalake/myfolder/",
            "fileName": "*",
            "modifiedDatetimeStart": "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z",
            "modifiedDatetimeEnd": "2018-12-01T06:00:00Z",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "columnDelimiter": ",",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n"
            },
            "compression": {
                "type": "GZip",
                "level": "Optimal"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Legacy copy activity source model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The `type` property of the copy activity source must be set to **AzureDataLakeStoreSource**. |Yes |
| recursive | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. When `recursive` is set to true and the sink is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the sink. Allowed values are **true** (default) and **false**. | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to the data store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No |

**Example:**

### Legacy copy activity sink model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The `type` property of the copy activity sink must be set to **AzureDataLakeStoreSink**. |Yes |
| copyBehavior | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of the source file to the source folder is identical to the relative path of the target file to the target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the target folder. The target files have autogenerated names. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, the file name is autogenerated. | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections | The number of connections to connect to the data store concurrently. Specify only when you want to limit the concurrent connection to the data store. | No |
