# SSIS migration with Azure SQL Managed Instance as the database workload destination

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

When migrating database workloads from a SQL Server instance to Azure SQL Managed Instance, you should be familiar with [Azure Data Migration Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-overview)(DMS), and the [network topologies for SQL Managed Instance migrations using DMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/resource-network-topologies).

This article focuses on the migration of SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS) packages stored in SSIS catalog (SSISDB) and SQL Server Agent jobs that schedule SSIS package executions.

## Migrate SSIS catalog (SSISDB)

SSISDB migration can be done using DMS, as described in the article:
[Migrate SSIS packages to SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/how-to-migrate-ssis-packages-managed-instance).

## SSIS jobs to SQL Managed Instance agent

SQL Managed Instance has a native, first-class scheduler just like SQL Server Agent on premises.  You can [run SSIS packages via Azure SQL Managed Instance Agent](how-to-invoke-ssis-package-managed-instance-agent.md).

Since a migration tool for SSIS jobs is not yet available, they have to be migrated from SQL Server Agent on premises to SQL Managed Instance agent via scripts/manual copy.
