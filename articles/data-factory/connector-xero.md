# Copy data from Xero using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Xero. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Xero connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Xero to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Xero connector supports:

- Xero [private application](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/api-application-types) but not public application.
- All Xero tables (API endpoints) except "Reports". 

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Xero connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Xero linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Xero** | Yes |
| host | The endpoint of the Xero server (`api.xero.com`).  | Yes |
| consumerKey | The consumer key associated with the Xero application. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| privateKey | The private key from the .pem file that was generated for your Xero private application, see [Create a public/private key pair](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api-guides/create-publicprivate-key). Note to **generate the privatekey.pem with numbits of 512** using `openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 512`; 1024 is not supported. Include all the text from the .pem file including the Unix line endings(\n), see sample below.<br/><br/>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether the host name is required in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "XeroLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Xero",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host" : "api.xero.com",
            "consumerKey": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<consumerKey>"
            },
            "privateKey": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<privateKey>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Sample private key value:**

Include all the text from the .pem file including the Unix line endings(\n).

```
"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII***************************************************P\nbu****************************************************s\nU/****************************************************B\nA*****************************************************W\njH****************************************************e\nsx*****************************************************l\nq******************************************************X\nh*****************************************************i\nd*****************************************************s\nA*****************************************************dsfb\nN*****************************************************M\np*****************************************************Ly\nK*****************************************************Y=\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Xero dataset.

To copy data from Xero, set the type property of the dataset to **XeroObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **XeroObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "XeroDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "XeroObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Xero linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Xero source.

### Xero as source

To copy data from Xero, set the source type in the copy activity to **XeroSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **XeroSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Contacts"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromXero",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Xero input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "XeroSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Contacts"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

Note the following when specifying the Xero query:

- Tables with complex items will be split to multiple tables. For example, Bank transactions has a complex data structure "LineItems", so data of bank transaction is mapped to table `Bank_Transaction` and `Bank_Transaction_Line_Items`, with `Bank_Transaction_ID` as foreign key to link them together.

- Xero data is available through two schemas: `Minimal` (default) and `Complete`. The Complete schema contains prerequisite call tables which require additional data (e.g. ID column) before making the desired query.

The following tables have the same information in the Minimal and Complete schema. To reduce the number of API calls, use Minimal schema (default).

- Bank_Transactions
- Contact_Groups 
- Contacts 
- Contacts_Sales_Tracking_Categories 
- Contacts_Phones 
- Contacts_Addresses 
- Contacts_Purchases_Tracking_Categories 
- Credit_Notes 
- Credit_Notes_Allocations 
- Expense_Claims 
- Expense_Claim_Validation_Errors
- Invoices 
- Invoices_Credit_Notes
- Invoices_ Prepayments 
- Invoices_Overpayments 
- Manual_Journals 
- Overpayments 
- Overpayments_Allocations 
- Prepayments 
- Prepayments_Allocations 
- Receipts 
- Receipt_Validation_Errors 
- Tracking_Categories

The following tables can only be queried with complete schema:

- Complete.Bank_Transaction_Line_Items 
- Complete.Bank_Transaction_Line_Item_Tracking 
- Complete.Contact_Group_Contacts 
- Complete.Contacts_Contact_ Persons 
- Complete.Credit_Note_Line_Items 
- Complete.Credit_Notes_Line_Items_Tracking 
- Complete.Expense_Claim_ Payments 
- Complete.Expense_Claim_Receipts 
- Complete.Invoice_Line_Items 
- Complete.Invoices_Line_Items_Tracking
- Complete.Manual_Journal_Lines 
- Complete.Manual_Journal_Line_Tracking 
- Complete.Overpayment_Line_Items 
- Complete.Overpayment_Line_Items_Tracking 
- Complete.Prepayment_Line_Items 
- Complete.Prepayment_Line_Item_Tracking 
- Complete.Receipt_Line_Items 
- Complete.Receipt_Line_Item_Tracking 
- Complete.Tracking_Category_Options
