# Surrogate key transformation in mapping data flow 

Use the surrogate key transformation to add an incrementing key value to each row of data. This is useful when designing dimension tables in a star schema analytical data model. In a star schema, each member in your dimension tables requires a unique key that is a non-business key.

## Configuration

![Surrogate Key Transform](media/data-flow/surrogate.png "Surrogate Key Transformation")

**Key column:** The name of the generated surrogate key column.

**Start value:** The lowest key value that will be generated.

## Increment keys from existing sources

To start your sequence from a value that exists in a source, use a derived column transformation following your surrogate key transformation to add the two values together:

![SK add Max](media/data-flow/sk006.png "Surrogate Key Transformation Add Max")

### Increment from existing maximum value

To seed the key value with the previous max, there are two techniques that you can use based on where your source data is.

#### Database sources

Use a SQL query option to select MAX() from your source. For example, `Select MAX(<surrogateKeyName>) as maxval from <sourceTable>`/

![Surrogate Key Query](media/data-flow/sk002.png "Surrogate Key Transformation Query")

#### File sources

If your previous max value is in a file, use the `max()` function in the aggregate transformation to get the previous max value:

![Surrogate Key File](media/data-flow/sk008.png "Surrogate Key File")

In both cases, you must join your incoming new data together with your source that contains the previous max value.

![Surrogate Key Join](media/data-flow/sk004.png "Surrogate Key Join")

## Data flow script

### Syntax

```
<incomingStream> 
    keyGenerate(
        output(<surrogateColumnName> as long),
        startAt: <number>L
    ) ~> <surrogateKeyTransformationName>
```

### Example

![Surrogate Key Transform](media/data-flow/surrogate.png "Surrogate Key Transformation")

The data flow script for the above surrogate key configuration is in the code snippet below.

```
AggregateDayStats
    keyGenerate(
        output(key as long),
        startAt: 1L
    ) ~> SurrogateKey1
```

## Next steps

These examples use the [Join](data-flow-join.md) and [Derived Column](data-flow-derived-column.md) transformations.
