# Copy data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector supports OAuth 2 authentication. It is built on top of the [Salesforce Marketing Cloud REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-apis.meta/mc-apis/index-api.htm).

>[!NOTE]
>This connector doesn't support retrieving custom objects or custom data extensions.

## Getting started

You can create a pipeline with copy activity using .NET SDK, Python SDK, Azure PowerShell, REST API, or Azure Resource Manager template. See [Copy activity tutorial](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Salesforce Marketing Cloud linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **SalesforceMarketingCloud** | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID associated with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud application.  | Yes |
| clientSecret | The client secret associated with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud application. You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in ADF, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let ADF copy activity pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SalesforceMarketingCloudLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SalesforceMarketingCloud",
        "typeProperties": {
            "clientId" : "<clientId>",
            "clientSecret": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<clientSecret>"
            },
            "useEncryptedEndpoints" : true,
            "useHostVerification" : true,
            "usePeerVerification" : true
        }
    }
}

```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Salesforce Marketing Cloud dataset.

To copy data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud, set the type property of the dataset to **SalesforceMarketingCloudObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **SalesforceMarketingCloudObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SalesforceMarketingCloudDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SalesforceMarketingCloudObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<SalesforceMarketingCloud linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Salesforce Marketing Cloud source.

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud as source

To copy data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud, set the source type in the copy activity to **SalesforceMarketingCloudSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **SalesforceMarketingCloudSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSalesforceMarketingCloud",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<SalesforceMarketingCloud input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SalesforceMarketingCloudSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
