# Provision the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory with PowerShell
This tutorial provides steps for provisioning an Azure-SSIS integration runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory. Then, you can use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to deploy and run SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages in this runtime in Azure. In this tutorial, you do the following steps:

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses Azure PowerShell to provision an Azure SSIS IR. To use the Data Factory user interface (UI) to provision an Azure SSIS IR, see [Tutorial: Create an Azure SSIS integration runtime](tutorial-create-azure-ssis-runtime-portal.md). 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a data factory.
> * Create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime
> * Start the Azure-SSIS integration runtime
> * Deploy SSIS packages
> * Review the complete script

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

- **Azure subscription**. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin. For conceptual information on Azure-SSIS IR, see [Azure-SSIS integration runtime overview](concepts-integration-runtime.md#azure-ssis-integration-runtime). 
- **Azure SQL Database server**. If you don't already have a database server, create one in the Azure portal before you get started. This server hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). We recommend that you create the database server in the same Azure region as the integration runtime. This configuration lets the integration runtime write execution logs to SSISDB without crossing Azure regions. 
    - Based on the selected database server, SSISDB can be created on your behalf as a single database, part of an elastic pool, or in a Managed Instance and accessible in public network or by joining a virtual network. For guidance in choosing the type of database server to host SSISDB, see [Compare Azure SQL Database single databases/elastic pools and Managed Instance](../data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md#compare-sql-database-single-databaseelastic-pool-and-sql-database-managed-instance). If you use Azure SQL Database with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance to host SSISDB or require access to on-premises data, you need to join your Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR in a virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime). 
    - Confirm that the "**Allow access to Azure services**" setting is **ON** for the database server. This setting is not applicable when you use Azure SQL Database with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance to host SSISDB. For more information, see [Secure your Azure SQL database](../sql-database/sql-database-security-tutorial.md#create-firewall-rules). To enable this setting by using PowerShell, see [New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule](/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqlserverfirewallrule). 
    - Add the IP address of the client machine or a range of IP addresses that includes the IP address of client machine to the client IP address list in the firewall settings for the database server. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database server-level and database-level firewall rules](../sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure.md). 
    - You can connect to the database server using SQL authentication with your server admin credentials or Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication with the managed identity for your Azure Data Factory.  For the latter, you need to add the managed identity for your ADF into an AAD group with access permissions to the database server, see [Create Azure-SSIS IR with AAD authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime). 
    - Confirm that your Azure SQL Database server does not have an SSIS Catalog (SSISDB database). The provisioning of Azure-SSIS IR does not support using an existing SSIS Catalog. 
- **Azure PowerShell**. Follow the instructions in [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps). You use PowerShell to run a script to provision an Azure-SSIS integration runtime that runs SSIS packages in the cloud. 

> [!NOTE]
> - For a list of Azure regions in which Data Factory and Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime are currently available, see [ADF + SSIS IR availability by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=data-factory&regions=all). 

## Launch Windows PowerShell ISE
Start **Windows PowerShell ISE** with administrative privileges. 

## Create variables
Copy and paste the following script: Specify values for the variables. For a list of supported **pricing tiers** for Azure SQL Database, see [SQL Database resource limits](../sql-database/sql-database-resource-limits.md).

```powershell
# Azure Data Factory information 
# If your input contains a PSH special character, e.g. "$", precede it with the escape character "`" like "`$"
$SubscriptionName = "[Azure subscription name]"
$ResourceGroupName = "[Azure resource group name]"
# Data factory name. Must be globally unique
$DataFactoryName = "[Data factory name]"
$DataFactoryLocation = "EastUS"

# Azure-SSIS integration runtime information - This is a Data Factory compute resource for running SSIS packages
$AzureSSISName = "[Specify a name for your Azure-SSIS IR]"
$AzureSSISDescription = "[Specify a description for your Azure-SSIS IR]"
$AzureSSISLocation = "EastUS"
# For supported node sizes, see https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-factory/ssis/
$AzureSSISNodeSize = "Standard_D8_v3"
# 1-10 nodes are currently supported
$AzureSSISNodeNumber = 2 
# Azure-SSIS IR edition/license info: Standard or Enterprise 
$AzureSSISEdition = "Standard" # Standard by default, while Enterprise lets you use advanced/premium features on your Azure-SSIS IR
# Azure-SSIS IR hybrid usage info: LicenseIncluded or BasePrice
$AzureSSISLicenseType = "LicenseIncluded" # LicenseIncluded by default, while BasePrice lets you bring your own on-premises SQL Server license to earn cost savings from Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) option
# For a Standard_D1_v2 node, 1-4 parallel executions per node are supported, but for other nodes, 1-8 are currently supported
$AzureSSISMaxParallelExecutionsPerNode = 8
# Custom setup info
$SetupScriptContainerSasUri = "" # OPTIONAL to provide SAS URI of blob container where your custom setup script and its associated files are stored

# SSISDB info
$SSISDBServerEndpoint = "[your Azure SQL Database server name].database.windows.net" # WARNING: Please ensure that there is no existing SSISDB, so we can prepare and manage one on your behalf    
$SSISDBServerAdminUserName = "[your server admin username for SQL authentication]"
$SSISDBServerAdminPassword = "[your server admin password for SQL authentication]"
# For the basic pricing tier, specify "Basic", not "B" - For standard/premium/elastic pool tiers, specify "S0", "S1", "S2", "S3", etc.
$SSISDBPricingTier = "[Basic|S0|S1|S2|S3|S4|S6|S7|S9|S12|P1|P2|P4|P6|P11|P15|â€¦|ELASTIC_POOL(name = <elastic_pool_name>)]"
```

## Validate the connection to database
Add the following script to validate your Azure SQL Database server, `<servername>.database.windows.net`. 

```powershell
$SSISDBConnectionString = "Data Source=" + $SSISDBServerEndpoint + ";User ID=" + $SSISDBServerAdminUserName + ";Password=" + $SSISDBServerAdminPassword    
$sqlConnection = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection $SSISDBConnectionString;
Try
{
    $sqlConnection.Open();
}
Catch [System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException]
{
    Write-Warning "Cannot connect to your Azure SQL Database server, exception: $_";
    Write-Warning "Please make sure the server you specified has already been created. Do you want to proceed? [Y/N]"
    $yn = Read-Host
    if(!($yn -ieq "Y"))
    {
        Return;
    } 
}
```

To create an Azure SQL database as part of the script, see the following example: 

Set values for the variables that haven't been defined already. For example: SSISDBServerName, FirewallIPAddress. 

```powershell
New-AzSqlServer -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
    -ServerName $SSISDBServerName `
    -Location $DataFactoryLocation `
    -SqlAdministratorCredentials $(New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $SSISDBServerAdminUserName, $(ConvertTo-SecureString -String $SSISDBServerAdminPassword -AsPlainText -Force))    

New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
    -ServerName $SSISDBServerName `
    -FirewallRuleName "ClientIPAddress_$today" -StartIpAddress $FirewallIPAddress -EndIpAddress $FirewallIPAddress

New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -ServerName $SSISDBServerName -AllowAllAzureIPs
```

## Log in and select subscription
Add the following code to the script to log in and select your Azure subscription: 

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName $SubscriptionName
```

## Create a resource group
Create an [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md) using the [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) command. A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed as a group. The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `westeurope` location.

If your resource group already exists, don't copy this code to your script. 

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Location $DataFactoryLocation -Name $ResourceGroupName
```

## Create a data factory
Run the following command to create a data factory:

```powershell
Set-AzDataFactoryV2 -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                         -Location $DataFactoryLocation `
                         -Name $DataFactoryName
```

## Create an integration runtime
Run the following command to create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime that runs SSIS packages in Azure: 

```powershell
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString $SSISDBServerAdminPassword -AsPlainText -Force
$serverCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($SSISDBServerAdminUserName, $secpasswd)
  
Set-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                                           -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName `
                                           -Name $AzureSSISName `
                                           -Description $AzureSSISDescription `
                                           -Type Managed `
                                           -Location $AzureSSISLocation `
                                           -NodeSize $AzureSSISNodeSize `
                                           -NodeCount $AzureSSISNodeNumber `
                                           -Edition $AzureSSISEdition `
                                           -LicenseType $AzureSSISLicenseType `
                                           -MaxParallelExecutionsPerNode $AzureSSISMaxParallelExecutionsPerNode `
                                           -CatalogServerEndpoint $SSISDBServerEndpoint `
                                           -CatalogAdminCredential $serverCreds `
                                           -CatalogPricingTier $SSISDBPricingTier

if(![string]::IsNullOrEmpty($SetupScriptContainerSasUri))
{
    Set-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                                               -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName `
                                               -Name $AzureSSISName `
                                               -SetupScriptContainerSasUri $SetupScriptContainerSasUri
}
```

## Start integration runtime
Run the following command to start the Azure-SSIS integration runtime: 

```powershell
write-host("##### Starting your Azure-SSIS integration runtime. This command takes 20 to 30 minutes to complete. #####")
Start-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `
                                             -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName `
                                             -Name $AzureSSISName `
                                             -Force

write-host("##### Completed #####")
write-host("If any cmdlet is unsuccessful, please consider using -Debug option for diagnostics.")                                  
```
This command takes from **20 to 30 minutes** to complete. 

## Deploy SSIS packages
Now, use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to deploy your SSIS packages to Azure. Connect to your Azure SQL server that hosts the SSIS catalog (SSISDB). The name of the Azure SQL Database server is in the format: `<servername>.database.windows.net`. 

See the following articles from SSIS documentation: 

- [Deploy, run, and monitor an SSIS package on Azure](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-deploy-run-monitor-tutorial)   
- [Connect to SSIS catalog on Azure](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-connect-to-catalog-database)
- [Schedule package execution on Azure](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-schedule-packages)
- [Connect to on-premises data sources with Windows authentication](/sql/integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-connect-with-windows-auth) 

## Full script
The PowerShell script in this section configures an instance of Azure-SSIS integration runtime in the cloud that runs SSIS packages. After you run this script successfully, you can deploy and run SSIS packages in the Microsoft Azure cloud with SSISDB hosted in Azure SQL Database.

1. Launch the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).
2. In the ISE, run the following command from the command prompt.    
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
3. Copy the PowerShell script in this section and paste it into the ISE.
4. Provide appropriate values for all parameters at the beginning of the script.
5. Run the script. The `Start-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime` command near the end of the script runs for **20 to 30 minutes**.

> [!NOTE]
> - The script connects to your Azure SQL Database server to prepare the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB).
> 
> - When you provision an instance of Azure-SSIS IR, the Azure Feature Pack for SSIS and the Access Redistributable are also installed. These components provide connectivity to Excel and Access files and to various Azure data sources, in addition to the data sources supported by the built-in components. You can also install additional components. For more info, see [Custom setup for the Azure-SSIS integration runtime](how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup.md).

## Join Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network
If you use Azure SQL Database with virtual network service endpoints/Managed Instance that joins a virtual network to host SSISDB, you must also join your Azure-SSIS integration runtime to the same virtual network. Azure Data Factory lets you join your Azure-SSIS integration runtime to a virtual network. For more information, see [Join Azure-SSIS integration runtime to a virtual network](join-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-virtual-network.md).

For a full script to create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime that joins a virtual network, see [Create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime](create-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md).

## Monitor and manage Azure-SSIS IR
See the following articles for details about monitoring and managing an Azure-SSIS IR. 

- [Monitor an Azure-SSIS integration runtime](monitor-integration-runtime.md#azure-ssis-integration-runtime)
- [Manage an Azure-SSIS integration runtime](manage-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md)
