# Copy data from Square using Azure Data Factory (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Square. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

This Square connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Square to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Square connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Square linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Square** | Yes |
| connectionProperties | A group of properties that defines how to connect to Square. | Yes |
| ***Under `connectionProperties`:*** | | |
| host | The URL of the Square instance. (i.e. mystore.mysquare.com)  | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID associated with your Square application.  | Yes |
| clientSecret | The client secret associated with your Square application. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| accessToken | The access token obtained from Square. Grants limited access to a Square account by asking an authenticated user for explicit permissions. OAuth access tokens expires 30 days after issued, but refresh tokens do not expire. Access tokens can be refreshed by refresh token.<br>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md).  | Yes |
| refreshToken | The refresh token obtained from Square. Used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires.<br>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

Square support two types of access token: **personal** and **OAuth**.

- Personal access tokens are used to get unlimited Connect API access to resources in your own Square account.
- OAuth access tokens are used to get authenticated and scoped Connect API access to any Square account. Use them when your app accesses resources in other Square accounts on behalf of account owners. OAuth access tokens can also be used to access resources in your own Square account.

In Data Factory, Authentication via personal access token  only needs `accessToken`, while authentication via OAuth requires `accessToken` and `refreshToken`. Learn how to retrieve access token from [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens).

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SquareLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Square",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionProperties": {
                "host": "<e.g. mystore.mysquare.com>", 
                "clientId": "<client ID>", 
                "clientSecrect": {
                    "type": "SecureString",
                    "value": "<clientSecret>"
                }, 
                "accessToken": {
                    "type": "SecureString",
                    "value": "<access token>"
                }, 
                "refreshToken": {
                    "type": "SecureString",
                    "value": "<refresh token>"
                }, 
                "useEncryptedEndpoints": true, 
                "useHostVerification": true, 
                "usePeerVerification": true 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Square dataset.

To copy data from Square, set the type property of the dataset to **SquareObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **SquareObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SquareDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SquareObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Square linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Square source.

### Square as source

To copy data from Square, set the source type in the copy activity to **SquareSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **SquareSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Business"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSquare",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Square input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SquareSource",

        }
    }
