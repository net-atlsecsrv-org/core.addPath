# Troubleshoot pipeline orchestration and triggers in Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

A pipeline run in Azure Data Factory defines an instance of a pipeline execution. For example, let's say you have a pipeline that runs at 8:00 AM, 9:00 AM, and 10:00 AM. In this case, there are three separate pipeline runs. Each pipeline run has a unique pipeline run ID. A run ID is a globally unique identifier (GUID) that defines that particular pipeline run.

Pipeline runs are typically instantiated by passing arguments to parameters that you define in the pipeline. You can run a pipeline either manually or by using a trigger. See [Pipeline execution and triggers in Azure Data Factory](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md) for details.

## Common issues, causes, and solutions

### An Azure Functions app pipeline throws an error with private endpoint connectivity
 
You have Data Factory and an Azure function app running on a private endpoint. You're trying to run a pipeline that interacts with the function app. You've tried three different methods, but one returns error "Bad Request," and the other two methods return "103 Error Forbidden."

**Cause**: Data Factory currently doesn't support a private endpoint connector for function apps. Azure Functions rejects calls because it's configured to allow only connections from a private link.

**Resolution**: Create a **PrivateLinkService** endpoint and provide your function app's DNS.

### A pipeline run is canceled but the monitor still shows progress status

When you cancel a pipeline run, pipeline monitoring often still shows the progress status. This happens because of a browser cache issue. You also might not have the correct monitoring filters.

**Resolution**: Refresh the browser and apply the correct monitoring filters.
 
### You see a "DelimitedTextMoreColumnsThanDefined" error when copying a pipeline
 
If a folder you're copying contains files with different schemas, such as variable number of columns, different delimiters, quote char settings, or some data issue, the Data Factory pipeline might throw this error:

`
Operation on target Copy_sks  failed: Failure happened on 'Sink' side.
ErrorCode=DelimitedTextMoreColumnsThanDefined,
'Type=Microsoft.DataTransfer.Common.Shared.HybridDeliveryException,
Message=Error found when processing 'Csv/Tsv Format Text' source '0_2020_11_09_11_43_32.avro' with row number 53: found more columns than expected column count 27.,
Source=Microsoft.DataTransfer.Common,'
`

**Resolution**: Select the **Binary Copy** option while creating the Copy activity. This way, for bulk copies or migrating your data from one data lake to another, Data Factory won't open the files to read the schema. Instead, Data Factory will treat each file as binary and copy it to the other location.

### A pipeline run fails when you reach the capacity limit of the integration runtime

Error message:

`
Type=Microsoft.DataTransfer.Execution.Core.ExecutionException,Message=There are substantial concurrent MappingDataflow executions which is causing failures due to throttling under Integration Runtime 'AutoResolveIntegrationRuntime'.
`

**Cause**: You've reached the integration runtime's capacity limit. You might be running a large amount of data flow by using the same integration runtime at the same time. See [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#version-2) for details.

**Resolution**:
 
- Run your pipelines at different trigger times.
- Create a new integration runtime, and split your pipelines across multiple integration runtimes.

### You have activity-level errors and failures in pipelines

Azure Data Factory orchestration allows conditional logic and enables users to take different paths based upon the outcome of a previous activity. It allows four conditional paths: **Upon Success** (default pass), **Upon Failure**, **Upon Completion**, and **Upon Skip**. 

Azure Data Factory evaluates the outcome of all leaf-level activities. Pipeline results are successful only if all leaves succeed. If a leaf activity was skipped, we evaluate its parent activity instead. 

**Resolution**

1. Implement activity-level checks by following [How to handle pipeline failures and errors](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-factory/understanding-pipeline-failures-and-error-handling/ba-p/1630459).
1. Use Azure Logic Apps to monitor pipelines in regular intervals following [Query By Factory](/rest/api/datafactory/pipelineruns/querybyfactory).

## Monitor pipeline failures in regular intervals

You might need to monitor failed Data Factory pipelines in intervals, say 5 minutes. You can query and filter the pipeline runs from a data factory by using the endpoint. 

Set up an Azure logic app to query all of the failed pipelines every 5 minutes, as described in [Query By Factory](/rest/api/datafactory/pipelineruns/querybyfactory). Then, you can report incidents to our ticketing system.
