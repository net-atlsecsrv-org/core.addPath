# Customize the setup for an Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

The custom setup for an Azure-SQL Server Integration Services Integration Runtime (Azure-SSIS IR) provides an interface for adding your own steps during the setup or reconfiguration of your Azure-SSIS IR. 

By using the custom setup, you can alter the default operating configuration or environment to, for example, start additional Windows services, persist access credentials for file shares, or use strong cryptography/more secure network protocol (TLS 1.2). Or you can install additional components, such as assemblies, drivers, or extensions, on each node of your Azure-SSIS IR.

You can do custom setups on your Azure-SSIS IR in either of two ways: 
* **Express custom setup without a script**: Run some common system configurations and Windows commands or install some popular or recommended additional components without using any scripts.
* **Standard custom setup with a script**: Prepare a script and its associated files, and upload them all together to a blob container in your Azure storage account. You then provide a Shared Access Signature (SAS) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for your container when you set up or reconfigure your Azure-SSIS IR. Each node of your Azure-SSIS IR then downloads the script and its associated files from your container and runs your custom setup with elevated permissions. When your custom setup is finished, each node uploads the standard output of execution and other logs to your container.

You can install both free, unlicensed components and paid, licensed components with express and standard custom setups. If you're an independent software vendor (ISV), see [Develop paid or licensed components for an Azure-SSIS IR](how-to-develop-azure-ssis-ir-licensed-components.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To benefit from future enhancements, we recommend using v3 or later series of nodes for your Azure-SSIS IR with custom setup.

## Current limitations

The following limitations apply only to standard custom setups:

- If you want to use *gacutil.exe* in your script to install assemblies in the global assembly cache (GAC), you need to provide *gacutil.exe* as part of your custom setup. Or you can use the copy that's provided in our *Public Preview* container, discussed later in the "Instructions" section.

- If you want to reference a subfolder in your script, *msiexec.exe* doesn't support the `.\` notation to reference the root folder. Use a command such as `msiexec /i "MySubfolder\MyInstallerx64.msi" ...` instead of `msiexec /i ".\MySubfolder\MyInstallerx64.msi" ...`.

- Administrative shares, or hidden network shares that are automatically created by Windows, are currently not supported on the Azure-SSIS IR.

- The IBM iSeries Access ODBC driver is not supported on the Azure-SSIS IR. You might see installation errors during your custom setup. If you do, contact IBM support for assistance.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

To customize your Azure-SSIS IR, you need the following items:

- [An Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

- [Provision your Azure-SSIS IR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/tutorial-deploy-ssis-packages-azure)

- [An Azure storage account](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/). Not required for express custom setups. For standard custom setups, you upload and store your custom setup script and its associated files in a blob container. The custom setup process also uploads its execution logs to the same blob container.

## Instructions

1. If you want to set up or reconfigure your Azure-SSIS IR with PowerShell, download and install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). For express custom setups, skip to step 4.

1. Prepare your custom setup script and its associated files (for example, .bat, .cmd, .exe, .dll, .msi, or .ps1 files).

   * You must have a script file named *main.cmd*, which is the entry point of your custom setup.  
   * To ensure that the script can be executed silently, we recommend that you test it on your local machine first.  
   * If you want additional logs generated by other tools (for example, *msiexec.exe*) to be uploaded to your container, specify the predefined environment variable, `CUSTOM_SETUP_SCRIPT_LOG_DIR`, as the log folder in your scripts (for example, *msiexec /i xxx.msi /quiet /lv %CUSTOM_SETUP_SCRIPT_LOG_DIR%\install.log*).

1. Download, install, and open [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/). To do so:

   a. Under **(Local and Attached)**, right-click **Storage Accounts**, and then select **Connect to Azure storage**.

      ![Connect to Azure Storage](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image1.png)

   b. Select **Use a storage account name and key**, and then select **Next**.

      ![Use a storage account name and key](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image2.png)

   c. Enter your Azure storage account name and key, select **Next**, and then select **Connect**.

      ![Provide storage account name and key](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image3.png)

   d. Under your connected Azure storage account, right-click **Blob Containers**, select **Create Blob Container**, and name the new container.

      ![Create a blob container](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image4.png)

   e. Select the new container, and upload your custom setup script and its associated files. Make sure that you upload *main.cmd* at the top level of your container, not in any folder. Also ensure that your container contains only the necessary custom setup files, so that downloading them to your Azure-SSIS IR later won't take a long time. The maximum duration of a custom setup is currently set at 45 minutes before it times out. This includes the time to download all files from your container and install them on the Azure-SSIS IR. If setup requires more time, raise a support ticket.

      ![Upload files to the blob container](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image5.png)

   f. Right-click the container, and then select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

      ![Get the Shared Access Signature for the container](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image6.png)

   g. Create the SAS URI for your container with a sufficiently long expiration time and with read/write/list permission. You need the SAS URI to download and run your custom setup script and its associated files whenever any node of your Azure-SSIS IR is reimaged or restarted. You need write permission to upload setup execution logs.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Ensure that the SAS URI doesn't expire and the custom setup resources are always available during the whole lifecycle of your Azure-SSIS IR, from creation to deletion, especially if you regularly stop and start your Azure-SSIS IR during this period.

      ![Generate the Shared Access Signature for the container](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image7.png)

   h. Copy and save the SAS URI of your container.

      ![Copy and save the Shared Access Signature](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image8.png)

1. When you set up or reconfigure your Azure-SSIS IR with a data factory UI, you can add or remove custom setups by selecting the **Customize your Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime with additional system configurations/component installations** check box in the **Advanced Settings** section of the **Integration runtime setup** pane. 

   If you want to add standard custom setups, enter the SAS URI of your container in the **Custom setup container SAS URI** box. 
   
   If you want to add express custom setups, select **New** to open the **Add express custom setup** pane, and then select a type in the **Express custom setup type** drop-down list:

   * If you select the **Run cmdkey command** type, you can persist access credentials for your file shares or Azure Files shares on Azure-SSIS IR by entering your targeted computer name or domain name, account name or username, and account key or password in the **/Add**, **/User**, and **/Pass** boxes. This is similar to running the Windows [cmdkey](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmdkey) command on your local machine.
   
   * If you select the **Add environment variable** type, you can add Windows environment variables to use in your packages that run on the Azure-SSIS IR by entering your environment variable name and value in the **Variable name** and **Variable value** boxes. This is similar to running the Windows [set](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1) command on your local machine.

   * If you select the **Install licensed component** type, you can then select an integrated component from our ISV partners in the **Component name** drop-down list:

     * If you select the **SentryOne's Task Factory** component, you can install the [Task Factory](https://www.sentryone.com/products/task-factory/high-performance-ssis-components) suite of components from SentryOne on your Azure-SSIS IR by entering the product license key that you purchased from them in the **License key** box. The current integrated version is **2019.4.3**.

     * If you select the **oh22's HEDDA.IO** component, you can install the [HEDDA.IO](https://hedda.io/ssis-component/) data quality/cleansing component from oh22 on your Azure-SSIS IR after purchasing their service. The current integrated version is **1.0.13**.

     * If you select the **oh22's SQLPhonetics.NET** component, you can install the [SQLPhonetics.NET](https://sqlphonetics.oh22.is/sqlphonetics-net-for-microsoft-ssis/) data quality/matching component from oh22 on your Azure-SSIS IR by entering the product license key that you purchased from them in the **License key** box. The current integrated version is **1.0.43**.

     * If you select the **KingswaySoft's SSIS Integration Toolkit** component, you can install the [SSIS Integration Toolkit](https://www.kingswaysoft.com/products/ssis-integration-toolkit-for-microsoft-dynamics-365) suite of connectors for CRM/ERP/marketing/collaboration apps, such as Microsoft Dynamics/SharePoint/Project Server, Oracle/Salesforce Marketing Cloud, etc. from KingswaySoft on your Azure-SSIS IR by entering the product license key that you purchased from them in the **License key** box. The current integrated version is **2019.2**.

     * If you select the **KingswaySoft's SSIS Productivity Pack** component, you can install the [SSIS Productivity Pack](https://www.kingswaysoft.com/products/ssis-productivity-pack) suite of components from KingswaySoft on your Azure-SSIS IR by entering the product license key that you purchased from them in the **License key** box. The current integrated version is **10.0**.

     * If you select the **Theobald Software's Xtract IS** component, you can install the [Xtract IS](https://theobald-software.com/en/xtract-is/) suite of connectors for SAP system (ERP, S/4HANA, BW) from Theobald Software on your Azure-SSIS IR by dragging & dropping/uploading the product license file that you purchased from them into the **License file** box. The current integrated version is **6.1.1.3**.

   Your added express custom setups will appear in the **Advanced Settings** section. To remove them, select their check boxes, and then select **Delete**.

   ![Advanced settings with custom setups](./media/tutorial-create-azure-ssis-runtime-portal/advanced-settings-custom.png)

1. When you set up or reconfigure your Azure-SSIS IR with PowerShell, you can add or remove the custom setups by running the `Set-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime` cmdlet before you start your Azure-SSIS IR.
   
   ```powershell

       }    
       if($ExpressCustomSetup -eq "Theobald.XtractIS")
       {
           $jsonData = Get-Content -Raw -Path YourLicenseFile.json
           $jsonData = $jsonData -replace '\s',''
           $jsonData = $jsonData.replace('"','\"')
           $licenseKey = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataFactory.Models.SecureString($jsonData)
           $setup = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataFactory.Models.ComponentSetup($ExpressCustomSetup, $licenseKey)
       }
       # Create an array of one or more express custom setups
       $setups = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
       $setups.Add($setup)

	   Set-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName `

       -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName `
       -Name $AzureSSISName `
       -Force
   ```
   
   After your standard custom setup finishes and your Azure-SSIS IR starts, you can find the standard output of *main.cmd* and other execution logs in the *main.cmd.log* folder of your storage container.

1. To view some samples of standard custom setups, connect to our Public Preview container by using Azure Storage Explorer.

   a. Under **(Local and Attached)**, right-click **Storage Accounts**, select **Connect to Azure storage**, select **Use a connection string or a shared access signature URI**, and then select **Next**.

      ![Connect to Azure storage with the Shared Access Signature](media/how-to-configure-azure-ssis-ir-custom-setup/custom-setup-image9.png)

   b. Select **Use a SAS URI** and then, in the **URI** box, enter the following SAS URI:

      `https://ssisazurefileshare.blob.core.windows.net/publicpreview?sp=rl&st=2020-03-25T04:00:00Z&se=2025-03-25T04:00:00Z&sv=2019-02-02&sr=c&sig=WAD3DATezJjhBCO3ezrQ7TUZ8syEUxZZtGIhhP6Pt4I%3D`
