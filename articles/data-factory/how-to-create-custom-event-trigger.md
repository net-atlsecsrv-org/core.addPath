# Create a trigger that runs a pipeline in response to a custom event (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article describes the Custom Event Triggers that you can create in your Data Factory pipelines.

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a common data integration pattern that involves production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. Data integration scenarios often require Data Factory customers to trigger pipelines based on certain events happening. Data Factory native integration with [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/) now covers [Custom Events](../event-grid/custom-topics.md): customers send arbitrary events to an event grid topic, and Data Factory subscribes and listens to the topic and triggers pipelines accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> The integration described in this article depends on [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/). Make sure that your subscription is registered with the Event Grid resource provider. For more info, see [Resource providers and types](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#azure-portal). You must be able to do the *Microsoft.EventGrid/eventSubscriptions/** action. This action is part of the EventGrid EventSubscription Contributor built-in role.

Furthermore, combining pipeline parameters and Custom Event Trigger, customers can parse and reference custom _data_ payload in pipeline runs. _data_ field in Custom Event payload is a free-form json key-value structure, giving customers maximum control over the event driven pipeline runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every so often, a key referenced in parameterization may be missing in custom event payload. The _trigger run_ will fail with an error, stating that expression cannot be evaluated because property _keyName_ doesn't exist. __No__ _pipeline run_ will be triggered by the event.

## Setup Event Grid Custom Topic

To use the Custom Event Trigger in Data Factory, you need to _first_ set up a [Custom Topic in Event Grid](../event-grid/custom-topics.md). The workflow is different from Storage Event Trigger, where Data Factory will set up the topic for you. Here you need to navigate the Azure Event Grid and create the topic yourself. For more information on how to create the custom topic, see Azure Event Grid [Portal Tutorials](../event-grid/custom-topics.md#azure-portal-tutorials) and [CLI Tutorials](../event-grid/custom-topics.md#azure-cli-tutorials)

Data Factories expect the events to follow [Event Grid event schema](../event-grid/event-schema.md). Make sure event payloads have following fields.

```json
[
  {
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

## Data Factory UI

This section shows you how to create a storage event trigger within the Azure Data Factory User Interface.

1. Switch to the **Edit** tab, shown with a pencil symbol.

1. Select **Trigger** on the menu, then select **New/Edit**.

1. On the **Add Triggers** page, select **Choose trigger...**, then select **+New**.

1. Select trigger type **Custom Events**

1. Select your custom topic from the Azure subscription dropdown or manually enter the event topic scope.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To create a new or modify an existing Custom Event Trigger, the Azure account used to log into Data Factory and publish the storage event trigger must have appropriate role based access control (Azure RBAC) permission on topic. No additional permission is required: Service Principal for the Azure Data Factory does _not_ need special permission to Event Grid. For more information about access control, see [Role based access control](#role-based-access-control) section.

1. The **Subject begins with** and **Subject ends with** properties allow you to filter events for which you want to trigger pipeline. Both properties are optional.

1. Use **+ New** to add **Event Types** you want to filter on. Custom Event trigger employee an OR relationship for the list: if a custom event has an _eventType_ property that matches any listed here, it will trigger a pipeline run. The event type is case insensitive. For instance, in the screenshot below, the trigger matches all _copycompleted_ or _copysucceeded_ events with subject starts with _factories_

1. Custom event trigger can parse and send custom _data_ payload to your pipeline. First create the pipeline parameters, and fill in the values on the **Parameters** page. Use format **@triggerBody().event.data._keyName_** to parse the data payload, and pass values to pipeline parameters. For detailed explanation, see [Reference Trigger Metadata in Pipelines](how-to-use-trigger-parameterization.md) and [System Variables in Custom Event Trigger](control-flow-system-variables.md#custom-event-trigger-scope)

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-custom-event-trigger/custom-event-3-parameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Parameters page to reference data payload in custom event.":::

1. Click **OK** once you are done.

## JSON schema

The following table provides an overview of the schema elements that are related to custom event triggers:

| **JSON Element** | **Description** | **Type** | **Allowed Values** | **Required** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **scope** | The Azure Resource Manager resource ID of the event grid topic. | String | Azure Resource Manager ID | Yes |
| **events** | The type of events that cause this trigger to fire. | Array of strings    |  | Yes, at least one value is expected |
| **subjectBeginsWith** | Subject field must begin with the pattern provided for the trigger to fire. For example, `factories` only fires the trigger for event subject starting with `factories`. | String   | | No |
| **subjectEndsWith** | Subject field must end with the pattern provided for the trigger to fire. | String   | | No |

## Role-based access control

Azure Data Factory uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to ensure that unauthorized access to listen to, subscribe to updates from, and trigger pipelines linked to custom events, are strictly prohibited.

* To successfully create a new or update an existing Custom Event Trigger, the Azure account signed into the Data Factory needs to have appropriate access to the relevant storage account. Otherwise, the operation with fail with _Access Denied_.
* Data Factory needs no special permission to your Event Grid, and you do _not_ need to assign special Azure RBAC permission to Data Factory service principal for the operation.

Specifically, customer needs _Microsoft.EventGrid/EventSubscriptions/Write_ permission on _/subscriptions/####/resourceGroups//####/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/someTopics_
