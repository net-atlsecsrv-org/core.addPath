# Copy data from an on-premises SQL Server database to Azure Blob storage
In this tutorial, you use the Azure Data Factory user interface (UI) to create a data factory pipeline that copies data from an on-premises SQL Server database to Azure Blob storage. You create and use a self-hosted integration runtime, which moves data between on-premises and cloud data stores.

> [!NOTE]
> This article doesn't provide a detailed introduction to Data Factory. For more information, see [Introduction to Data Factory](introduction.md). 

In this tutorial, you perform the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a data factory.
> * Create a self-hosted integration runtime.
> * Create SQL Server and Azure Storage linked services. 
> * Create SQL Server and Azure Blob datasets.
> * Create a pipeline with a copy activity to move the data.
> * Start a pipeline run.
> * Monitor the pipeline run.

## Prerequisites
### Azure subscription
Before you begin, if you don't already have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Azure roles
To create data factory instances, the user account you use to sign in to Azure must be assigned a *Contributor* or *Owner* role or must be an *administrator* of the Azure subscription. 

To view the permissions you have in the subscription, go to the Azure portal. In the upper-right corner, select your user name, and then select **Permissions**. If you have access to multiple subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription. For sample instructions on how to add a user to a role, see [Manage access using RBAC and the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

### SQL Server 2014, 2016, and 2017
In this tutorial, you use an on-premises SQL Server database as a *source* data store. The pipeline in the data factory you create in this tutorial copies data from this on-premises SQL Server database (source) to Blob storage (sink). You then create a table named **emp** in your SQL Server database and insert a couple of sample entries into the table. 

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio. If it's not already installed on your machine, go to [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms). 

1. Connect to your SQL Server instance by using your credentials. 

1. Create a sample database. In the tree view, right-click **Databases**, and then select **New Database**. 
1. In the **New Database** window, enter a name for the database, and then select **OK**. 

1. To create the **emp** table and insert some sample data into it, run the following query script against the database:

   ```
    CREATE TABLE dbo.emp
    (
        ID int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
        FirstName varchar(50),
        LastName varchar(50)
    )
    GO
    
    INSERT INTO emp (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('John', 'Doe')
    INSERT INTO emp (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe')
    GO
   ```

1. In the tree view, right-click the database that you created, and then select **New Query**.

### Azure storage account
In this tutorial, you use a general-purpose Azure storage account (specifically, Blob storage) as a destination/sink data store. If you don't have a general-purpose Azure storage account, see [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md). The pipeline in the data factory that you create in this tutorial copies data from the on-premises SQL Server database (source) to Blob storage (sink). 

#### Get the storage account name and account key
You use the name and key of your storage account in this tutorial. To get the name and key of your storage account, take the following steps: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure user name and password. 

1. In the left pane, select **More services**. Filter by using the **Storage** keyword, and then select **Storage accounts**.

    ![Storage account search](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/search-storage-account.png)

1. In the list of storage accounts, filter for your storage account, if needed. Then select your storage account. 

1. In the **Storage account** window, select **Access keys**.

    ![Access keys](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/storage-account-name-key.png)

1. In the **Storage account name** and **key1** boxes, copy the values, and then paste them into Notepad or another editor for later use in the tutorial. 

#### Create the adftutorial container 
In this section, you create a blob container named **adftutorial** in your Blob storage. 

1. In the **Storage account** window, go to **Overview**, and then select **Blobs**. 

    ![Select Blobs option](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/select-blobs.png)

1. In the **Blob service** window, select **Container**. 

    ![Container button](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/add-container-button.png)

1. In the **New container** window, under **Name**, enter **adftutorial**. Then select **OK**. 

    ![New container window](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/new-container-dialog.png)

1. In the list of containers, select **adftutorial**.

    ![Container selection](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/select-adftutorial-container.png)

1. Keep the **container** window for **adftutorial** open. You use it verify the output at the end of the tutorial. Data Factory automatically creates the output folder in this container, so you don't need to create one.

    ![Container window](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-powershell/container-page.png)


## Create a data factory
In this step, you create a data factory and start the Data Factory UI to create a pipeline in the data factory. 

1. Open the **Microsoft Edge** or **Google Chrome** web browser. Currently, Data Factory UI is supported only in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome web browsers.
1. On the left menu, select **Create a resource** > **Data + Analytics** > **Data Factory**:
   
   ![Data Factory selection in the "New" pane](./media/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal/new-azure-data-factory-menu.png)

1. On the **New data factory** page, under **Name**, enter **ADFTutorialDataFactory**. 
   
     ![New data factory page](./media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-portal/new-azure-data-factory.png)

The name of the data factory must be *globally unique*. If you see the following error message for the name field, change the name of the data factory (for example, yournameADFTutorialDataFactory). For naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see [Data Factory naming rules](naming-rules.md).

   ![New data factory name](./media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-portal/name-not-available-error.png)
1. Select the Azure **subscription** in which you want to create the data factory.
1. For **Resource Group**, take one of the following steps:
   
   - Select **Use existing**, and select an existing resource group from the drop-down list.

   - Select **Create new**, and enter the name of a resource group.
        
     To learn about resource groups, see [Use resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md).
1. Under **Version**, select **V2**.
1. Under **Location**, select the location for the data factory. Only locations that are supported are displayed in the drop-down list. The data stores (for example, Storage and SQL Database) and computes (for example, Azure HDInsight) used by Data Factory can be in other regions.
1. Select **Pin to dashboard**. 
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the dashboard, you see the following tile with the status **Deploying Data Factory**:

	![Deploying data factory tile](media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-portal/deploying-data-factory.png)
1. After the creation is finished, you see the **Data Factory** page as shown in the image:
   
    ![Data factory home page](./media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-portal/data-factory-home-page.png)
1. Select the **Author & Monitor** tile to launch the Data Factory UI in a separate tab. 


## Create a pipeline

1. On the **Let's get started** page, select **Create pipeline**. A pipeline is automatically created for you. You see the pipeline in the tree view, and its editor opens. 

   ![Let's get started page](./media/tutorial-hybrid-copy-portal/get-started-page.png)
