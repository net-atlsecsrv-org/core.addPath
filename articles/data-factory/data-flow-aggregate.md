# Aggregate transformation in Mapping Data Flow 



The Aggregate transformation is where you'll define aggregations of columns in your data streams. Using the Expression Builder, you can define different types of aggregations such as SUM, MIN, MAX, and COUNT which can be grouped by existing or computed columns.

## Group by
Select an existing column or create a new computed column to use as a group by clause for your aggregation. To use an existing column, select the desired column from the dropdown. To create a new computed column, hover over the clause and click 'Computed column'. This will open up the [Data Flow Expression Builder](concepts-data-flow-expression-builder.md). Once you create your computed column, enter the output column name under the 'Name as' field. If you wish to add an additional group by clause, hover over an existing clause and click '+'.

> [!NOTE]
> A group by clause is optional in an Aggregate transformation.

## Aggregate column 
Choose the 'Aggregates' tab to build aggregation expressions. You can either choose an existing column and overwrite the value with the aggregation, or create a new field with a new name. The aggregation expression is entered in the right-hand box next to the column name selector. To edit the expression, click on the text box to open up the Expression Builder. To add an additional aggregation, hover over an existing expression and click '+' to create a new aggregation column or [column pattern](concepts-data-flow-column-pattern.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Each aggregation expression must contain at least one aggregate function.

> [!NOTE]
> In Debug mode, the expression builder cannot produce data previews with aggregate functions. To view data previews for aggregate transformations, close the expression builder and view the data via the 'Data Preview' tab.

## Reconnect rows and columns
Aggregate transformations are closely equivalent to SQL aggregate select queries. Columns that are not included in your Group By clause or Aggregate functions will not flow through to the output of your Aggregate transformation. If there are other columns that you wish to include with your aggregated rows output, you must either:

* Use an aggregate function to include that additional column, such as Last() or First()
* Re-join the columns before your Aggregate using the [Self Join pattern](https://mssqldude.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/adf-data-flows-self-join/).

## Next steps

* Define window-based aggregation using the [Window transformation](data-flow-window.md)
