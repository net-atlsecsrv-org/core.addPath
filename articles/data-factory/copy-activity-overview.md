# Copy activity in Azure Data Factory

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory that you're using:"]

In Azure Data Factory, you can use the Copy activity to copy data among data stores located on-premises and in the cloud. After you copy the data, you can use other activities to further transform and analyze it. You can also use the Copy activity to publish transformation and analysis results for business intelligence (BI) and application consumption.

![The role of the Copy activity](media/copy-activity-overview/copy-activity.png)

The Copy activity is executed on an [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md). You can use different types of integration runtimes for different data copy scenarios:

* When you're copying data between two data stores that are publicly accessible through the internet from any IP, you can use the Azure integration runtime for the copy activity. This integration runtime is secure, reliable, scalable, and [globally available](concepts-integration-runtime.md#integration-runtime-location).
* When you're copying data to and from data stores that are located on-premises or in a network with access control (for example, an Azure virtual network), you need to set up a self-hosted integration runtime.

An integration runtime needs to be associated with each source and sink data store. For information about how the Copy activity determines which integration runtime to use, see [Determining which IR to use](concepts-integration-runtime.md#determining-which-ir-to-use).

To copy data from a source to a sink, the service that runs the Copy activity performs these steps:

1. Reads data from a source data store.
2. Performs serialization/deserialization, compression/decompression, column mapping, and so on. It performs these operations based on the configuration of the input dataset, output dataset, and Copy activity.
3. Writes data to the sink/destination data store.

![Copy activity overview](media/copy-activity-overview/copy-activity-overview.png)

## Supported data stores and formats

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-supported-data-stores](../../includes/data-factory-v2-supported-data-stores.md)]

### Supported file formats

You can use the Copy activity to copy files as is between two file-based data stores. In this case, the data is copied efficiently without any serialization or deserialization.

The Copy activity can also read from and write to files in these formats:
- Text
- JSON
- Avro
- ORC
- Parquet

The Copy activity can compress and decompress files with these codecs: 
- Gzip
- Deflate
- Bzip2
- ZipDeflate

For more information, see [Supported file and compression formats](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md).

For example, you can perform the following copy activities:

* Copy data from an on-premises SQL Server database and write the data to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Parquet format.
* Copy files in text (CSV) format from an on-premises file system and write to Azure Blob storage in Avro format.
* Copy zipped files from an on-premises file system, decompress them, and write them to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
* Copy data in Gzip compressed-text (CSV) format from Azure Blob storage and write it to Azure SQL Database.
* Many more activities that require serialization/deserialization or compression/decompression.

## Supported regions

The service that enables the Copy activity is available globally in the regions and geographies listed in [Azure integration runtime locations](concepts-integration-runtime.md#integration-runtime-location). The globally available topology ensures efficient data movement that usually avoids cross-region hops. See [Products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services) to check the availability of Data Factory and data movement in a specific region.

## Configuration

To use the Copy activity in Azure Data Factory, you need to:

1. **Create linked services for the source data store and the sink data store.** Refer to the connector article's "Linked service properties" section for configuration information and supported properties. You can find the list of supported connectors in the [Supported data stores and formats](#supported-data-stores-and-formats) section of this article.
2. **Create datasets for the source and sink.** Refer to the "Dataset properties" sections of the source and sink connector articles for configuration information and supported properties.
3. **Create a pipeline with the Copy activity.** The next section provides an example.

The durations of these steps are exclusive. Only durations that apply to the given Copy activity run appear:<br/>**Queuing duration** (`queuingDuration`): The amount of time before the Copy activity actually starts on the integration runtime. If you use a self-hosted IR and this value is large, check the IR capacity and usage, and scale up or out according to your workload. <br/>**Pre-copy script duration** (`preCopyScriptDuration`): The time elapsed between when the Copy activity starts on the IR and when the Copy activity finishes running the pre-copy script in the sink data store. Applies when you configure the pre-copy script. <br/>**Time to first byte** (`timeToFirstByte`): The time elapsed between the end of the previous step and the time when the IR receives the first byte from the source data store. Applies to non-file-based sources. If this value is large, check and optimize the query or server.<br/>**Transfer duration** (`transferDuration`): The time elapsed between the end of the previous step and the time when the IR transfers all the data from source to sink. | Array |

## Schema and data type mapping

See [Schema and data type mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) for information about how the Copy activity maps your source data to your sink.

## Fault tolerance

By default, the Copy activity stops copying data and returns a failure when source data rows are incompatible with sink data rows. To make the copy succeed, you can configure the Copy activity to skip and log the incompatible rows and copy only the compatible data. See [Copy activity fault tolerance](copy-activity-fault-tolerance.md) for details.

## Performance and tuning

The [Copy activity performance and scalability guide](copy-activity-performance.md) describes key factors that affect the performance of data movement via the Copy activity in Azure Data Factory. It also lists the performance values observed during testing and discusses how to optimize the performance of the Copy activity.

In some scenarios, when you run a Copy activity in Data Factory, you'll see **Performance tuning tips** at the top of the [Copy activity monitoring page](#monitor-visually), as shown in the following example. The tips tell you the bottleneck identified for the given copy run. They also provide information on what to change to boost copy throughput. The performance tuning tips currently provide suggestions like using PolyBase when copying data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse, increasing Azure Cosmos DB RUs or Azure SQL Database DTUs when the resource on the data store side is the bottleneck, and removing unnecessary staged copies.

**Example: Copy into Azure SQL Database, with a performance tuning tip**

In this sample, during a copy run, Data Factory tracks a high DTU utilization in the sink Azure SQL Database. This condition slows down write operations. The suggestion is to increase the DTUs on the Azure SQL Database tier:

![Copy monitoring with performance tuning tips](./media/copy-activity-overview/copy-monitoring-with-performance-tuning-tips.png)

## Incremental copy
Data Factory enables you to incrementally copy delta data from a source data store to a sink data store. For details, see [Tutorial: Incrementally copy data](tutorial-incremental-copy-overview.md).

## Next steps
