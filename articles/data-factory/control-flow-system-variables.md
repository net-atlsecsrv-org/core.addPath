# System variables supported by Azure Data Factory
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article describes system variables supported by Azure Data Factory. You can use these variables in expressions when defining Data Factory entities.

## Pipeline scope
These system variables can be referenced anywhere in the pipeline JSON.

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| @pipeline().DataFactory |Name of the data factory the pipeline run is running in |
| @pipeline().Pipeline |Name of the pipeline |
| @pipeline().RunId |ID of the specific pipeline run |
| @pipeline().TriggerType |The type of trigger that invoked the pipeline (for example, `ScheduleTrigger`, `BlobEventsTrigger`). For a list of supported trigger types, see [Pipeline execution and triggers in Azure Data Factory](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md). A trigger type of `Manual` indicates that the pipeline was triggered manually. |
| @pipeline().TriggerId|ID of the trigger that invoked the pipeline |
| @pipeline().TriggerName|Name of the trigger that invoked the pipeline |
| @pipeline().TriggerTime|Time of the trigger run that invoked the pipeline. This is the time at which the trigger **actually** fired to invoke the pipeline run, and it may differ slightly from the trigger's scheduled time.  |

>[!NOTE]
>Trigger-related date/time system variables (in both pipeline and trigger scopes) return UTC dates in ISO 8601 format, for example, `2017-06-01T22:20:00.4061448Z`.

## Schedule trigger scope
These system variables can be referenced anywhere in the trigger JSON for triggers of type [ScheduleTrigger](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md#schedule-trigger).

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| @trigger().scheduledTime |Time at which the trigger was scheduled to invoke the pipeline run. |
| @trigger().startTime |Time at which the trigger **actually** fired to invoke the pipeline run. This may differ slightly from the trigger's scheduled time. |

## Tumbling window trigger scope
These system variables can be referenced anywhere in the trigger JSON for triggers of type [TumblingWindowTrigger](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md#tumbling-window-trigger).

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| @trigger().outputs.windowStartTime |Start of the window associated with the trigger run. |
| @trigger().outputs.windowEndTime |End of the window associated with the trigger run. |
| @trigger().scheduledTime |Time at which the trigger was scheduled to invoke the pipeline run. |
| @trigger().startTime |Time at which the trigger **actually** fired to invoke the pipeline run. This may differ slightly from the trigger's scheduled time. |

## Event-based trigger scope
These system variables can be referenced anywhere in the trigger JSON for triggers of type [BlobEventsTrigger](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md#event-based-trigger).

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| @triggerBody().fileName  |Name of the file whose creation or deletion caused the trigger to fire.   |
| @triggerBody().folderName  |Path to the folder that contains the file specified by `@triggerBody().fileName`. The first segment of the folder path is the name of the Azure Blob Storage container.  |
| @trigger().startTime |Time at which the trigger fired to invoke the pipeline run. |
