# Copy data from DB2 by using Azure Data Factory
> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory service you are using:"]
> * [Version 1](v1/data-factory-onprem-db2-connector.md)
> * [Current version](connector-db2.md)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from a DB2 database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This DB2 database connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from DB2 database to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this DB2 connector supports the following IBM DB2 platforms and versions with Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) SQL Access Manager (SQLAM) version 9, 10 and 11:

* IBM DB2 for z/OS 12.1
* IBM DB2 for z/OS 11.1
* IBM DB2 for z/OS 10.1
* IBM DB2 for i 7.3
* IBM DB2 for i 7.2
* IBM DB2 for i 7.1
* IBM DB2 for LUW 11
* IBM DB2 for LUW 10.5
* IBM DB2 for LUW 10.1

>[!TIP]
>DB2 connector is built on top of Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2. To troubleshoot DB2 connector errors, refer to [Data Provider Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/host-integration-server/db2oledbv/data-provider-error-codes#drda-protocol-errors).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](../../includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)]

The Integration Runtime provides a built-in DB2 driver, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver when copying data from DB2.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to DB2 connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for DB2 linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Db2** | Yes |
| server |Name of the DB2 server. You can specify the port number following the server name delimited by colon e.g. `server:port`. |Yes |
| database |Name of the DB2 database. |Yes |
| authenticationType |Type of authentication used to connect to the DB2 database.<br/>Allowed value is: **Basic**. |Yes |
| username |Specify user name to connect to the DB2 database. |Yes |
| password |Specify password for the user account you specified for the username. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| packageCollection	| Specify under where the needed packages are auto created by ADF when querying the database. | No |
| certificateCommonName | When you use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, you must enter a value for Certificate common name. | No |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

> [!TIP]
> If you receive an error message that states `The package corresponding to an SQL statement execution request was not found. SQLSTATE=51002 SQLCODE=-805`, the reason is a needed package is not created for the user. By default, ADF will try to create a the package under collection named as the user you used to connect to the DB2. Specify the package collection property to indicate under where you want ADF to create the needed packages when querying the database.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "Db2LinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Db2",
        "typeProperties": {
            "server": "<servername:port>",
            "database": "<dbname>",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by DB2 dataset.

To copy data from DB2, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **Db2Table** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| table | Name of the table. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| tableName | Name of the table with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. Use `schema` and `table` for new workload. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "DB2Dataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "Db2Table",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<DB2 linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using `RelationalTable` typed dataset, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by DB2 source.

### DB2 as source

To copy data from DB2, the following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **Db2Source** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"query": "SELECT * FROM \"DB2ADMIN\".\"Customers\""`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromDB2",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<DB2 input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "Db2Source",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM \"DB2ADMIN\".\"Customers\""
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If you were using `RelationalSource` typed source, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Data type mapping for DB2

When copying data from DB2, the following mappings are used from DB2 data types to Azure Data Factory interim data types. See [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

| DB2 Database type | Data factory interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| BigInt |Int64 |
| Binary |Byte[] |
| Blob |Byte[] |
| Char |String |
| Clob |String |
| Date |Datetime |
| DB2DynArray |String |
| DbClob |String |
| Decimal |Decimal |
| DecimalFloat |Decimal |
| Double |Double |
| Float |Double |
| Graphic |String |
| Integer |Int32 |
| LongVarBinary |Byte[] |
| LongVarChar |String |
| LongVarGraphic |String |
| Numeric |Decimal |
| Real |Single |
| SmallInt |Int16 |
| Time |TimeSpan |
| Timestamp |DateTime |
| VarBinary |Byte[] |
| VarChar |String |
| VarGraphic |String |
| Xml |Byte[] |
