# Copy data from Dynamics AX by using Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Dynamics AX source. The article builds on [Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory](copy-activity-overview.md), which presents a general overview of Copy Activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Dynamics AX connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Dynamics AX to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that Copy Activity supports as sources and sinks, see [Supported data stores and formats](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats).

Specifically, this Dynamics AX connector supports copying data from Dynamics AX using **OData protocol** with **Service Principal authentication**.

>[!TIP]
>You can also use this connector to copy data from **Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations**. Refer to Dynamics 365's [OData support](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/odata) and [Authentication method](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/services-home-page#authentication).

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties you can use to define Data Factory entities that are specific to Dynamics AX connector.

## Prerequisites

To use service principal authentication, follow these steps:

1. Register an application entity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by following [Register your application with an Azure AD tenant](../storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app.md#register-your-application-with-an-azure-ad-tenant). Make note of the following values, which you use to define the linked service:

    - Application ID
    - Application key
    - Tenant ID

2. Go to Dynamics AX, and grant this service principal proper permission to access your Dynamics AX.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Dynamics AX linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property must be set to **DynamicsAX**. |Yes |
| url | The Dynamics AX (or Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations) instance OData endpoint. |Yes |
| servicePrincipalId | Specify the application's client ID. | Yes |
| servicePrincipalKey | Specify the application's key. Mark this field as a **SecureString** to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| tenant | Specify the tenant information (domain name or tenant ID) under which your application resides. Retrieve it by hovering the mouse in the top-right corner of the Azure portal. | Yes |
| aadResourceId | Specify the AAD resource you are requesting for authorization. For example, if your Dynamics URL is `https://sampledynamics.sandbox.operations.dynamics.com/data/`, the corresponding AAD resource is usually `https://sampledynamics.sandbox.operations.dynamics.com`. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to use to connect to the data store. You can choose Azure Integration Runtime or a self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is located in a private network). If not specified, the default Azure Integration Runtime is used. |No |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "DynamicsAXLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "DynamicsAX",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "<Dynamics AX instance OData endpoint>",
            "servicePrincipalId": "<service principal id>",
            "servicePrincipalKey": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<service principal key>"
            },
            "tenant": "<tenant info, e.g. microsoft.onmicrosoft.com>",
            "aadResourceId": "<AAD resource, e.g. https://sampledynamics.sandbox.operations.dynamics.com>"
        }
    },
    "connectVia": {
        "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
        "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
    }
}

```

## Dataset properties

This section provides a list of properties that the Dynamics AX dataset supports.

For a full list of sections and properties that are available for defining datasets, see [Datasets and linked services](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md). 

To copy data from Dynamics AX, set the **type** property of the dataset to **DynamicsAXResource**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the dataset must be set to **DynamicsAXResource**. | Yes |
| path | The path to the Dynamics AX OData entity. | Yes |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "DynamicsAXResourceDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "DynamicsAXResource",
        "typeProperties": {
            "path": "<entity path e.g. dd04tentitySet>"
        },
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Dynamics AX linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy Activity properties

This section provides a list of properties that the Dynamics AX source supports.

For a full list of sections and properties that are available for defining activities, see [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md). 

### Dynamics AX as source

To copy data from Dynamics AX, set the **source** type in Copy Activity to **DynamicsAXSource**. The following properties are supported in the Copy Activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the Copy Activity source must be set to **DynamicsAXSource**. | Yes |
| query | OData query options for filtering data. Example: `"?$select=Name,Description&$top=5"`.<br/><br/>**Note**: The connector copies data from the combined URL: `[URL specified in linked service]/[path specified in dataset][query specified in copy activity source]`. For more information, see [OData URL components](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/). | No |

**Example**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromDynamicsAX",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Dynamics AX input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "DynamicsAXSource",
                "query": "$top=10"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
