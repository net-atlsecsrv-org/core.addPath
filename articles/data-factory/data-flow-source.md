# Source transformation in mapping data flow

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

A source transformation configures your data source for the data flow. When you design data flows, your first step is always configuring a source transformation. To add a source, select the **Add Source** box in the data flow canvas.

Every data flow requires at least one source transformation, but you can add as many sources as necessary to complete your data transformations. You can join those sources together with a join, lookup, or a union transformation.

Each source transformation is associated with exactly one dataset or linked service. The dataset defines the shape and location of the data you want to write to or read from. If you use a file-based dataset, you can use wildcards and file lists in your source to work with more than one file at a time.

## Inline datasets

The first decision you make when you create a source transformation is whether your source information is defined inside a dataset object or within the source transformation. Most formats are available in only one or the other. To learn how to use a specific connector, see the appropriate connector document.

When a format is supported for both inline and in a dataset object, there are benefits to both. Dataset objects are reusable entities that can be used in other data flows and activities such as Copy. These reusable entities are especially useful when you use a hardened schema. Datasets aren't based in Spark. Occasionally, you might need to override certain settings or schema projection in the source transformation.

Inline datasets are recommended when you use flexible schemas, one-off source instances, or parameterized sources. If your source is heavily parameterized, inline datasets allow you to not create a "dummy" object. Inline datasets are based in Spark, and their properties are native to data flow.

To use an inline dataset, select the format you want in the **Source type** selector. Instead of selecting a source dataset, you select the linked service you want to connect to.

##  <a name="supported-sources"></a> Supported source types

Mapping data flow follows an extract, load, and transform (ELT) approach and works with *staging* datasets that are all in Azure. Currently, the following datasets can be used in a source transformation.

| Connector | Format | Dataset/inline |

Settings specific to these connectors are located on the **Source options** tab. Information and data flow script examples on these settings are located in the connector documentation.

Azure Data Factory has access to more than [90 native connectors](connector-overview.md). To include data from those other sources in your data flow, use the Copy Activity to load that data into one of the supported staging areas.

## Source settings

After you've added a source, configure via the **Source settings** tab. Here you can pick or create the dataset your source points at. You can also select schema and sampling options for your data.

Development values for dataset parameters can be configured in [debug settings](concepts-data-flow-debug-mode.md). (Debug mode must be turned on.)

![Screenshot that shows the Source settings tab.](media/data-flow/source1.png "Screenshot that shows the Source settings tab.")

**Output stream name**: The name of the source transformation.

**Source type**: Choose whether you want to use an inline dataset or an existing dataset object.

**Test connection**: Test whether or not the data flow's Spark service can successfully connect to the linked service used in your source dataset. Debug mode must be on for this feature to be enabled.

**Schema drift**: [Schema drift](concepts-data-flow-schema-drift.md) is the ability of Data Factory to natively handle flexible schemas in your data flows without needing to explicitly define column changes.

* Select the **Allow schema drift** check box if the source columns will change often. This setting allows all incoming source fields to flow through the transformations to the sink.

* Selecting **Infer drifted column types** instructs Data Factory to detect and define data types for each new column discovered. With this feature turned off, all drifted columns will be of type string.

**Validate schema:** If **Validate schema** is selected, the data flow will fail to run if the incoming source data doesn't match the defined schema of the dataset.

**Skip line count**: The **Skip line count** field specifies how many lines to ignore at the beginning of the dataset.

**Sampling**: Enable **Sampling** to limit the number of rows from your source. Use this setting when you test or sample data from your source for debugging purposes.

To validate your source is configured correctly, turn on debug mode and fetch a data preview. For more information, see [Debug mode](concepts-data-flow-debug-mode.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When debug mode is turned on, the row limit configuration in debug settings will overwrite the sampling setting in the source during data preview.

## Source options

The **Source options** tab contains settings specific to the connector and format chosen. For more information and examples, see the relevant [connector documentation](#supported-sources).

## Projection

Like schemas in datasets, the projection in a source defines the data columns, types, and formats from the source data. For most dataset types, such as SQL and Parquet, the projection in a source is fixed to reflect the schema defined in a dataset. When your source files aren't strongly typed (for example, flat .csv files rather than Parquet files), you can define the data types for each field in the source transformation.

![Screenshot that shows settings on the Projection tab.](media/data-flow/source3.png "Screenshot that shows settings on the Projection tab.")

If your text file has no defined schema, select **Detect data type** so that Data Factory will sample and infer the data types. Select **Define default format** to autodetect the default data formats.

**Reset schema** resets the projection to what is defined in the referenced dataset.

You can modify the column data types in a downstream derived-column transformation. Use a select transformation to modify the column names.

### Import schema

Select the **Import schema** button on the **Projection** tab to use an active debug cluster to create a schema projection. It's available in every source type. Importing the schema here will override the projection defined in the dataset. The dataset object won't be changed.

Importing schema is useful in datasets like Avro and Azure Cosmos DB that support complex data structures that don't require schema definitions to exist in the dataset. For inline datasets, importing schema is the only way to reference column metadata without schema drift.

## Optimize the source transformation

The **Optimize** tab allows for editing of partition information at each transformation step. In most cases, **Use current partitioning** will optimize for the ideal partitioning structure for a source.

If you're reading from an Azure SQL Database source, custom **Source** partitioning will likely read data the fastest. Data Factory will read large queries by making connections to your database in parallel. This source partitioning can be done on a column or by using a query.

For more information on optimization within mapping data flow, see the [Optimize tab](concepts-data-flow-overview.md#optimize).

## Next steps

Begin building your data flow with a [derived-column transformation](data-flow-derived-column.md) and a [select transformation](data-flow-select.md).
