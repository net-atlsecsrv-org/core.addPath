# Copy data from SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) using Azure Data Factory
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from/to SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C). It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

>[!TIP]
>To learn ADF's overall support on SAP data integration scenario, see [SAP data integration using Azure Data Factory whitepaper](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-DataFactory/blob/master/whitepaper/SAP%20Data%20Integration%20using%20Azure%20Data%20Factory.pdf) with detailed introduction, comparsion and guidance.

## Supported capabilities

This SAP Cloud for Customer connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from SAP Cloud for Customer to any supported sink data store, or copy data from any supported source data store to SAP Cloud for Customer. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this connector enables Azure Data Factory to copy data from/to SAP Cloud for Customer including the SAP Cloud for Sales, SAP Cloud for Service, and SAP Cloud for Social Engagement solutions.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to SAP Cloud for Customer connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for SAP Cloud for Customer linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **SapCloudForCustomer**. | Yes |
| url | The URL of the SAP C4C OData service. | Yes |
| username | Specify the user name to connect to the SAP C4C. | Yes |
| password | Specify the password for the user account you specified for the username. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. | No for source, Yes for sink |

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To copy data into SAP Cloud for Customer, explicitly [create an Azure IR](create-azure-integration-runtime.md#create-azure-ir) with a location near your SAP Cloud for Customer, and associate in the linked service as the following example:

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SAPC4CLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SapCloudForCustomer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "https://<tenantname>.crm.ondemand.com/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/" ,
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties
