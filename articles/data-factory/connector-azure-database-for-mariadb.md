# Copy data from Azure Database for MariaDB using Azure Data Factory 

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Azure Database for MariaDB. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Azure Database for MariaDB to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Azure Database for MariaDB connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Azure Database for MariaDB linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **MariaDB** | Yes |
| connectionString | A connection string to connect to Azure Database for MariaDB. You can find it from the Azure portal -> your Azure Database for MariaDB -> Connection strings -> ADO.NET one. <br/>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory. You can also put password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `pwd` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use Self-hosted Integration Runtime or Azure Integration Runtime (if your data store is publicly accessible). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDatabaseForMariaDBLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MariaDB",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "Server={your_server}.mariadb.database.azure.com; Port=3306; Database={your_database}; Uid={your_user}@{your_server}; Pwd={your_password}; SslMode=Preferred;"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDatabaseForMariaDBLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MariaDB",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "Server={your_server}.mariadb.database.azure.com; Port=3306; Database={your_database}; Uid={your_user}@{your_server}; SslMode=Preferred;"
            },
            "pwd": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Database for MariaDB dataset.

To copy data from Azure Database for MariaDB, set the type property of the dataset to **MariaDBTable**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **MariaDBTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDatabaseForMariaDBDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MariaDBTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Azure Database for MariaDB linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {}
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Database for MariaDB source.

### Azure Database for MariaDB as source

To copy data from Azure Database for MariaDB, set the source type in the copy activity to **MariaDBSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MariaDBSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromAzureDatabaseForMariaDB",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Azure Database for MariaDB input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "MariaDBSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
