# Release notes for Data Management Gateway
> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 1 of Data Factory. If you are using the current version of the Data Factory service, see [self-hosted integration runtime in V2](../create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md).

One of the challenges for modern data integration is to move data to and from on-premises to cloud. Data Factory makes this integration with Data Management Gateway, which is an agent that you can install on-premises to enable hybrid data movement.

See the following articles for detailed information about Data Management Gateway and how to use it:

*  [Data Management Gateway](data-factory-data-management-gateway.md)
*  [Move data between on-premises and cloud using Azure Data Factory](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md)


## CURRENT VERSION 
We no more maintain the Release notes here. Get latest release notes [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853077)




## Earlier versions
## 2.10.6347.7
### Enhancements-
- You can add DNS entries to whitelist service bus rather than whitelisting all Azure IP addresses from your firewall (if needed). You can find respective DNS entry on Azure portal (Data Factory -> ‘Author and Deploy’ -> ‘Gateways’ -> "serviceUrls" (in JSON)
- HDFS connector now supports self-signed public certificate by letting you skip SSL validation.
- Fixed: Issue with gateway offline during update (due to clock skew)


## 2.9.6313.2
### Enhancements-
-	You can add DNS entries to whitelist Service Bus rather than whitelisting all Azure IP addresses from your firewall (if needed). More details here.
-	You can now copy data to/from a single block blob up to 4.75 TB, which is the max supported size of block blob. (earlier limit was 195 GB).
-	Fixed: Out of memory issue while unzipping several small files during copy activity.
-	Fixed: Index out of range issue while copying from Document DB to an on-premises SQL Server with idempotency feature.
-	Fixed: SQL cleanup script doesn't work with on-premises SQL Server from Copy Wizard.
-	Fixed: Column name with space at the end does not work in copy activity.

## 2.8.66283.3
### Enhancements-
- Fixed: Issue with missing credentials on gateway machine reboot.
- Fixed: Issue with registration during gateway restore using a backup file.


## 2.7.6240.1
### Enhancements-
- Fixed: Incorrect read of Decimal null value from Oracle as source.

## 2.6.6192.2
### What’s new
- Customers can provide feedback on gateway registering experience.
- Support a new compression format: ZIP (Deflate)

### Enhancements-
- Performance improvement for Oracle Sink, HDFS source.
- Bug fix for gateway auto update, gateway parallel processing capacity.


## 2.5.6164.1
### Enhancements
- Improved and more robust Gateway registration experience- Now you can track progress status during the Gateway registration process, which makes the registration experience more responsive.
- Improvement in Gateway Restore Process- You can still recover gateway even if you do not have the gateway backup file with this update. This would require you to reset Linked Service credentials in Portal.
- Bug fix.

## 2.4.6151.1

### What’s new

- You can now store data source credentials locally. The credentials are encrypted. The data source credentials can be recovered and restored using the backup file that can be exported from the existing Gateway, all on-premises.

### Enhancements-

- Improved and more robust Gateway registration experience.
- Support auto detection of QuoteChar configuration for Text format in copy wizard, and improve the overall format detection accuracy.

## 2.3.6100.2

- Support firstRowAsHeader and SkipLineCount auto detection in copy wizard for text files in on-premises File system and HDFS.
- Enhance the stability of network connection between gateway and Service Bus

    *  Make gateway status more visible on the Home tab.

    *  Reorganized and simplified controls.

	*  You can copy data from a storage using the [code-free copy tool](data-factory-copy-data-wizard-tutorial.md). See [Staged Copy](data-factory-copy-activity-performance.md#staged-copy) for details about this feature in general.
