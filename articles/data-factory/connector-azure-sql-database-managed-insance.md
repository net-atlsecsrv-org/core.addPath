# Copy data to and from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance by using Azure Data Factory

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data to and from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. It builds on the [Copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of the copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance to any supported sink data store. You also can copy data from any supported source data store to the managed instance. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources and sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Azure SQL Database Managed Instance connector supports:

- Copying data by using SQL or Windows authentication.
- As a source, retrieving data by using a SQL query or stored procedure.
- As a sink, appending data to a destination table or invoking a stored procedure with custom logic during copy.

SQL Server [Always Encrypted](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine?view=sql-server-2017) is not supported now. 

## Prerequisites

To use copy data from an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance that's located in a virtual network, set up a self-hosted integration runtime that can access the database. For more information, see [Self-hosted integration runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md).

If you provision your self-hosted integration runtime in the same virtual network as your managed instance, make sure that your integration runtime machine is in a different subnet than your managed instance. If you provision your self-hosted integration runtime in a different virtual network than your managed instance, you can use either a virtual network peering or virtual network to virtual network connection. For more information, see [Connect your application to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](../sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-connect-app.md).

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **SqlServer**. | Yes. |
| connectionString |This property specifies the connectionString information that's needed to connect to the managed instance by using either SQL authentication or Windows authentication. For more information, see the following examples. <br/>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory. You can also put password in Azure Key Vault，and if it's SQL authentication pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. See the JSON example below the table and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. |Yes. |
| userName |This property specifies a user name if you use Windows authentication. An example is **domainname\\username**. |No. |
| password |This property specifies a password for the user account you specified for the user name. Select **SecureString** to store the connectionString information securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |No. |
| connectVia | This [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) is used to connect to the data store. Provision the self-hosted integration runtime in the same virtual network as your managed instance. |Yes. |

>[!TIP]
>You might see the error code "UserErrorFailedToConnectToSqlServer" with a message like "The session limit for the database is XXX and has been reached." If this error occurs, add `Pooling=false` to your connection string and try again.

**Example 1: Use SQL authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureSqlMILinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "Data Source=<servername>\\<instance name if using named instance>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=False;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Use SQL authentication with password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureSqlMILinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "Data Source=<servername>\\<instance name if using named instance>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=False;User ID=<username>;"
            },
            "password": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 3: Use Windows authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureSqlMILinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "Data Source=<servername>\\<instance name if using named instance>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=True;"
            },
            "userName": "<domain\\username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for use to define datasets, see the datasets article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance dataset.

To copy data to and from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to **SqlServerTable**. | Yes. |
| tableName |This property is the name of the table or view in the database instance that the linked service refers to. | No for source. Yes for sink. |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureSqlMIDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Managed Instance linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "schema": [ < physical schema, optional, retrievable during authoring > ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "MyTable"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for use to define activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance source and sink.

### Azure SQL Database Managed Instance as a source

To copy data from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, set the source type in the copy activity to **SqlSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity source section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **SqlSource**. | Yes. |
| sqlReaderQuery |This property uses the custom SQL query to read data. An example is `select * from MyTable`. |No. |
| sqlReaderStoredProcedureName |This property is the name of the stored procedure that reads data from the source table. The last SQL statement must be a SELECT statement in the stored procedure. |No. |
| storedProcedureParameters |These parameters are for the stored procedure.<br/>Allowed values are name or value pairs. The names and casing of the parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. |No. |

Note the following points:

- If **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for **SqlSource**, the copy activity runs this query against the managed instance source to get the data. You also can specify a stored procedure by specifying **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** if the stored procedure takes parameters.
- If you don't specify either the **sqlReaderQuery** or **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** property, the columns defined in the "structure" section of the dataset JSON are used to construct a query. The query `select column1, column2 from mytable` runs against the managed instance. If the dataset definition doesn't have "structure," all columns are selected from the table.

**Example: Use a SQL query**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromAzureSqlMI",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Managed Instance input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SqlSource",
                "sqlReaderQuery": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**Example: Use a stored procedure**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromAzureSqlMI",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Managed Instance input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SqlSource",
                "sqlReaderStoredProcedureName": "CopyTestSrcStoredProcedureWithParameters",
                "storedProcedureParameters": {
                    "stringData": { "value": "str3" },
                    "identifier": { "value": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', <datetime parameter>)", "type": "Int"}
                }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**The stored procedure definition**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CopyTestSrcStoredProcedureWithParameters
(
    @stringData varchar(20),
    @identifier int
)
AS
SET NOCOUNT ON;
BEGIN
    select *
    from dbo.UnitTestSrcTable
    where dbo.UnitTestSrcTable.stringData != stringData
    and dbo.UnitTestSrcTable.identifier != identifier
END
GO
```

### Azure SQL Database Managed Instance as a sink

To copy data to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, set the sink type in the copy activity to **SqlSink**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity sink section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to **SqlSink**. | Yes. |
| writeBatchSize |Number of rows to inserts into the SQL table **per batch**.<br/>Allowed values are integers for the number of rows. By default, Data Factory dynamically determine the appropriate batch size based on the row size.  |No |
| writeBatchTimeout |This property specifies the wait time for the batch insert operation to complete before it times out.<br/>Allowed values are for the time span. An example is “00:30:00,” which is 30 minutes. |No. |
| preCopyScript |This property specifies a SQL query for the copy activity to execute before writing data into the managed instance. It's invoked only once per copy run. You can use this property to clean up preloaded data. |No. |
| sqlWriterStoredProcedureName |This name is for the stored procedure that defines how to apply source data into the target table. Examples of procedures are to do upserts or transforms by using your own business logic. <br/><br/>This stored procedure is *invoked per batch*. To do an operation that runs only once and has nothing to do with source data, for example, delete or truncate, use the `preCopyScript` property. |No. |
| storedProcedureParameters |These parameters are used for the stored procedure.<br/>Allowed values are name or value pairs. The names and casing of the parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. |No. |
| sqlWriterTableType |This property specifies a table type name to be used in the stored procedure. The copy activity makes the data being moved available in a temp table with this table type. Stored procedure code can then merge the data that's being copied with existing data. |No. |

> [!TIP]
> When data is copied to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, the copy activity appends data to the sink table by default. To perform an upsert or additional business logic, use the stored procedure in SqlSink. For more information, see [Invoke a stored procedure from a SQL sink](#invoke-a-stored-procedure-from-a-sql-sink).

**Example 1: Append data**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToAzureSqlMI",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Managed Instance output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "SqlSink",
                "writeBatchSize": 100000
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**Example 2: Invoke a stored procedure during copy for upsert**

Learn more details from [Invoke a stored procedure from a SQL sink](#invoke-a-stored-procedure-from-a-sql-sink).

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToAzureSqlMI",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Managed Instance output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "SqlSink",
                "sqlWriterStoredProcedureName": "CopyTestStoredProcedureWithParameters",
                "sqlWriterTableType": "CopyTestTableType",
                "storedProcedureParameters": {
                    "identifier": { "value": "1", "type": "Int" },
                    "stringData": { "value": "str1" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Identity columns in the target database

The following example copies data from a source table with no identity column to a destination table with an identity column.

**Source table**

```sql
create table dbo.SourceTbl
(
    name varchar(100),
    age int
)
```

**Destination table**

```sql
create table dbo.TargetTbl
(
    identifier int identity(1,1),
    name varchar(100),
    age int
)
```

Notice that the target table has an identity column.

**Source dataset JSON definition**

```json
{
    "name": "SampleSource",
    "properties": {
        "type": " SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "TestIdentitySQL",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "SourceTbl"
        }
    }
}
```

**Destination dataset JSON definition**

```json
{
    "name": "SampleTarget",
    "properties": {
        "structure": [
            { "name": "name" },
            { "name": "age" }
        ],
        "type": "SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "TestIdentitySQL",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "TargetTbl"
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that your source and target table have different schema. The target table has an identity column. In this scenario, specify the "structure" property in the target dataset definition, which doesn’t include the identity column.

## <a name="invoke-a-stored-procedure-from-a-sql-sink"></a> Invoke a stored procedure from a SQL sink

When data is copied into Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, a stored procedure can be configured and invoked with additional parameters that you specify.

You can use a stored procedure when built-in copy mechanisms don't serve the purpose. It's typically used when an upsert (update + insert) or extra processing must be done before the final insertion of source data in the destination table. Extra processing can include tasks such as merging columns, looking up additional values, and insertion into multiple tables.

The following sample shows how to use a stored procedure to do an upsert into a table in the SQL Server database. Assume that input data and the sink **Marketing** table each have three columns: **ProfileID**, **State**, and **Category**. Do the upsert based on the **ProfileID** column, and only apply it for a specific category.

**Output dataset:** the "tableName" should be the same table type parameter name in your stored procedure (see below stored procedure script).

```json
{
    "name": "AzureSqlMIDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Managed Instance linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "Marketing"
        }
    }
}
```

Define the **SQL sink** section in copy activity as follows.

```json
"sink": {
    "type": "SqlSink",
    "SqlWriterTableType": "MarketingType",
    "SqlWriterStoredProcedureName": "spOverwriteMarketing",
    "storedProcedureParameters": {
        "category": {
            "value": "ProductA"
        }
    }
}
```

In your database, define the stored procedure with the same name as the **SqlWriterStoredProcedureName**. It handles input data from your specified source and merges into the output table. The parameter name of the table type in the stored procedure should be the same as the **tableName** defined in the dataset.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spOverwriteMarketing @Marketing [dbo].[MarketingType] READONLY, @category varchar(256)
AS
BEGIN
  MERGE [dbo].[Marketing] AS target
  USING @Marketing AS source
  ON (target.ProfileID = source.ProfileID and target.Category = @category)
  WHEN MATCHED THEN
      UPDATE SET State = source.State
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
      INSERT (ProfileID, State, Category)
      VALUES (source.ProfileID, source.State, source.Category);
END
```

In your database, define the table type with the same name as sqlWriterTableType. The schema of the table type is the same as the schema returned by your input data.

```sql
CREATE TYPE [dbo].[MarketingType] AS TABLE(
    [ProfileID] [varchar](256) NOT NULL,
    [State] [varchar](256) NOT NULL，
    [Category] [varchar](256) NOT NULL
)
```

The stored procedure feature takes advantage of [table-valued parameters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb675163.aspx).

## Data type mapping for Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

When data is copied to and from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, the following mappings are used from Azure SQL Database Managed Instance data types to Azure Data Factory interim data types. To learn how the copy activity maps from the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Azure SQL Database Managed Instance data type | Azure Data Factory interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| bigint |Int64 |
| binary |Byte[] |
| bit |Boolean |
| char |String, Char[] |
| date |DateTime |
| Datetime |DateTime |
| datetime2 |DateTime |
| Datetimeoffset |DateTimeOffset |
| Decimal |Decimal |
| FILESTREAM attribute (varbinary(max)) |Byte[] |
| Float |Double |
| image |Byte[] |
| int |Int32 |
| money |Decimal |
| nchar |String, Char[] |
| ntext |String, Char[] |
| numeric |Decimal |
| nvarchar |String, Char[] |
| real |Single |
| rowversion |Byte[] |
| smalldatetime |DateTime |
| smallint |Int16 |
| smallmoney |Decimal |
| sql_variant |Object |
| text |String, Char[] |
| time |TimeSpan |
| timestamp |Byte[] |
| tinyint |Int16 |
| uniqueidentifier |Guid |
| varbinary |Byte[] |
| varchar |String, Char[] |
| xml |Xml |

>[!NOTE]
> For data types that map to the Decimal interim type, currently Azure Data Factory supports precision up to 28. If you have data that requires precision larger than 28, consider converting to a string in a SQL query.
