# Load data into Azure Synapse Analytics by using Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is.md) is a cloud-based, scale-out database that's capable of processing massive volumes of data, both relational and non-relational. Azure Synapse Analytics is built on the massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture that's optimized for enterprise data warehouse workloads. It offers cloud elasticity with the flexibility to scale storage and compute independently.

Getting started with Azure Synapse Analytics is now easier than ever when you use Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory is a fully managed cloud-based data integration service. You can use the service to populate an Azure Synapse Analytics with data from your existing system and save time when building your analytics solutions.

Azure Data Factory offers the following benefits for loading data into Azure Synapse Analytics:

* **Easy to set up**: An intuitive 5-step wizard with no scripting required.
* **Rich data store support**: Built-in support for a rich set of on-premises and cloud-based data stores. For a detailed list, see the table of [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats).
* **Secure and compliant**: Data is transferred over HTTPS or ExpressRoute. The global service presence ensures that your data never leaves the geographical boundary.
* **Unparalleled performance by using PolyBase**: Polybase is the most efficient way to move data into Azure Synapse Analytics. Use the staging blob feature to achieve high load speeds from all types of data stores, including Azure Blob storage and Data Lake Store. (Polybase supports Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Store by default.) For details, see [Copy activity performance](copy-activity-performance.md).

This article shows you how to use the Data Factory Copy Data tool to _load data from Azure SQL Database into Azure Synapse Analytics_. You can follow similar steps to copy data from other types of data stores.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Copy data to or from Azure Synapse Analytics by using Azure Data Factory](connector-azure-sql-data-warehouse.md).

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Azure Synapse Analytics: The data warehouse holds the data that's copied over from the SQL database. If you don't have an Azure Synapse Analytics, see the instructions in [Create an Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/load-data-from-azure-blob-storage-using-copy.md).
* Azure SQL Database: This tutorial copies data from the Adventure Works LT sample dataset in Azure SQL Database. You can create this sample database in SQL Database by following the instructions in [Create a sample database in Azure SQL Database](../azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart.md).
* Azure storage account: Azure Storage is used as the _staging_ blob in the bulk copy operation. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the instructions in [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

## Create a data factory

1. On the left menu, select **Create a resource** > **Data + Analytics** > **Data Factory**:

2. On the **New data factory** page, provide values for following items:

    * **Name**: Enter *LoadSQLDWDemo* for name. The name for your data factory must be *globally unique. If you receive the error "Data factory name 'LoadSQLDWDemo' is not available", enter a different name for the data factory. For example, you could use the name _**yourname**_**ADFTutorialDataFactory**. Try creating the data factory again. For the naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see [Data Factory naming rules](naming-rules.md).
    * **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription in which to create the data factory. 
    * **Resource Group**: Select an existing resource group from the drop-down list, or select the **Create new** option and enter the name of a resource group. To learn about resource groups, see [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).  
    * **Version**: Select **V2**.
    * **Location**: Select the location for the data factory. Only supported locations are displayed in the drop-down list. The data stores that are used by data factory can be in other locations and regions. These data stores include Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, and so on.

3. Select **Create**.
4. After creation is complete, go to your data factory. You see the **Data Factory** home page as shown in the following image:

   Select the **Author & Monitor** tile to launch the Data Integration Application in a separate tab.

## Load data into Azure Synapse Analytics

1. In the **Get started** page, select the **Copy Data** tile to launch the Copy Data tool.

2. In the **Properties** page, specify **CopyFromSQLToSQLDW** for the **Task name** field, and select **Next**.

    ![Properties page](./media/load-azure-sql-data-warehouse/copy-data-tool-properties-page.png)

3. In the **Source data store** page, complete the following steps:
    >[!TIP]
    >In this tutorial, you use *SQL authentication* as the authentication type for your source data store, but you can choose other supported authentication methods:*Service Principal* and *Managed Identity* if needed. Refer to corresponding sections in [this article](./connector-azure-sql-database.md#linked-service-properties) for details.
    >To store secrets for data stores securely, it's also recommended to use an Azure Key Vault. Refer to [this article](./store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) for detailed illustrations.

    a. click **+ Create new connection**.

    b. Select **Azure SQL Database** from the gallery, and select **Continue**. You can type "SQL" in the search box to filter the connectors.
