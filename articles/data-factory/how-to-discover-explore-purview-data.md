# Discover and explore data in ADF using Purview

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

In this article, you will register an Azure Purview Account to a Data Factory. That connection allows you to discover Azure Purview assets and interact with them through ADF capabilities. 

You can perform the following tasks in ADF: 
- Use the search box at the top to find Purview assets based on keywords 
- Understand the data based on metadata, lineage, annotations 
- Connect those data to your data factory with linked services or datasets 

## Prerequisites 
- [Azure Purview account](../purview/create-catalog-portal.md) 
- [Data Factory](./quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md) 
- [Connect an Azure Purview Account into Data Factory](./connect-data-factory-to-azure-purview.md) 

## Using Azure Purview in Data Factory 

The use Azure Purview in Data Factory requires you to have access to that Purview account. Data Factory passes-through your Purview permission. As an example, if you have a curator permission role, you will be able to edit metadata scanned by Azure Purview. 

### Data discovery: search datasets 

To discover data registered and scanned by Azure Purview, you can use the Search bar at the top center of Data Factory portal. Make sure that you select Azure Purview to search for all of your organization data.
