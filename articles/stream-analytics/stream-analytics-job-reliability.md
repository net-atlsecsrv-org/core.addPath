# Guarantee Stream Analytics job reliability during service updates

Part of being a fully managed service is the capability to introduce new service functionality and improvements at a rapid pace. As a result, Stream Analytics can have a service update deploy on a weekly (or more frequent) basis. No matter how much testing is done there is still a risk that an existing, running job may break due to the introduction of a bug. If you are running mission critical jobs, these risks need to be avoided. You can reduce this risk by following Azureâ€™s **[paired region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions)** model. 

## How do Azure paired regions address this concern?

Stream Analytics guarantees jobs in paired regions are updated in separate batches. As a result there is a sufficient time gap between the updates to identify potential issues and remediate them.

_With the exception of Central India_ (whose paired region, South India, does not have Stream Analytics presence), the deployment of an update to Stream Analytics would not occur at the same time in a set of paired regions. Deployments in multiple regions **in the same group** may occur **at the same time**.

The article on **[availability and paired regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions)** has the most up-to-date information on which regions are paired.

It is recommended to deploy identical jobs to both paired regions. You should then [monitor these jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-set-up-alerts#scenarios-to-monitor) to get notified when something unexpected happens. If one of these jobs ends up in a [Failed state](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/job-states) after a Stream Analytics service update, you can contact customer support to help identify the root cause. You should also fail over any downstream consumers to the healthy job output.
