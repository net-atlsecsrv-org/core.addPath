# Use managed identities to access Azure SQL Database from an Azure Stream Analytics job (Preview)

Azure Stream Analytics supports [Managed Identity authentication](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) for Azure SQL Database output sinks. Managed identities eliminate the limitations of user-based authentication methods, like the need to reauthenticate due to password changes or user token expirations that occur every 90 days. When you remove the need to manually authenticate, your Stream Analytics deployments can be fully automated.

A managed identity is a managed application registered in Azure Active Directory that represents a given Stream Analytics job. The managed application is used to authenticate to a targeted resource. This article shows you how to enable Managed Identity for an Azure SQL Database output(s) of a Stream Analytics job through the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to this feature:

- An Azure Stream Analytics job.

- An Azure SQL Database resource.

## Create a managed identity

First, you create a managed identity for your Azure Stream Analytics job.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Azure Stream Analytics job.

1. From the left navigation menu, select **Managed Identity** located under **Configure**. Then, check the box next to **Use System-assigned Managed Identity** and select **Save**.

   A service principal for the Stream Analytics job's identity is created in Azure Active Directory. The life cycle of the newly created identity is managed by Azure. When the Stream Analytics job is deleted, the associated identity (that is, the service principal) is automatically deleted by Azure. 

1. When you save the configuration, the Object ID (OID) of the service principal is listed as the Principal ID as shown below: 

   ![Object ID shown as Principal ID](./media/sql-db-output-managed-identity/principal-id.png)

   The service principal has the same name as the Stream Analytics job. For example, if the name of your job is *MyASAJob*, the name of the service principal is also *MyASAJob*.

## Select an Active Directory admin

After you've created a managed identity, you select an Active Directory admin.

1. Navigate to your Azure SQL Database resource and select the SQL Server that the database is under. You can find the SQL Server name next to *Server name* on the resource overview page. 

1. Select **Active Directory Admin** under **Settings**. Then, select **Set admin**. 

   ![Active Directory admin page](./media/sql-db-output-managed-identity/active-directory-admin-page.png)
 
1. On the Active Directory admin page, search for a user or group to be an administrator for the SQL Server and click **Select**.

   ![Add Active Directory admin](./media/sql-db-output-managed-identity/add-admin.png)

   The Active Directory admin page shows all members and groups of your Active Directory. Users or groups that are grayed out can't be selected because they're not supported as Azure Active Directory administrators. See the list of supported admins in the **Azure Active Directory Features and Limitations** section of [Use Azure Active Directory Authentication for authentication with SQL Database or Azure Synapse](../azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview.md#azure-ad-features-and-limitations). Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) applies only to the portal and is not propagated to SQL Server. Also, the selected user or group is the user who will be able to create the **Contained Database User** in the next section.

1. Select **Save** on the **Active Directory admin** page. The process for changing admin takes a few minutes.

   When you set up the Azure Active Directory admin, the new admin name (user or group) can't be present in the virtual primary database as a SQL Server authentication user. If present, the Azure Active Directory admin setup will fail and roll back its creation, indicating that an admin (name) already exists. Since the SQL Server authentication user is not part of Azure Active Directory, any effort to connect to the server using Azure Active Directory authentication as that user fails. 

## Create a contained database user

Next, you create a contained database user in your SQL Database that is mapped to the Azure Active Directory identity. The contained database user doesn't have a login for the primary database, but it maps to an identity in the directory that is associated with the database. The Azure Active Directory identity can be an individual user account or a group. In this case, you want to create a contained database user for your Stream Analytics job. 

1. Connect to SQL Database using SQL Server Management Studio. The **User name** is an Azure Active Directory user with the **ALTER ANY USER** permission. The admin you set on the SQL Server is an example. Use **Azure Active Directory – Universal with MFA** authentication. 

   ![Connect to SQL Server](./media/sql-db-output-managed-identity/connect-sql-server.png)

   The server name `<SQL Server name>.database.windows.net` may be different in different regions. For example, the China region should use `<SQL Server name>.database.chinacloudapi.cn`.
 
   You can specify a specific SQL Database by going to **Options > Connection Properties > Connect to Database**.  

   ![SQL Server connection properties](./media/sql-db-output-managed-identity/sql-server-connection-properties.png)

1. When you connect for the first time, you may encounter the following window:

   ![New firewall rule window](./media/sql-db-output-managed-identity/new-firewall-rule.png)

   1. If so, go to your SQL Server resource on the Azure portal. Under the **Security** section, open the **Firewalls and virtual network** page. 
   1. Add a new rule with any rule name.
   1. Use the *From* IP address from the **New Firewall Rule** window for the *Start IP*.
   1. Use the *To* IP address from the **New Firewall Rule** window for *End IP*. 
   1. Select **Save** and attempt to connect from SQL Server Management Studio again. 

1. Once you are connected, create the contained database user. The following SQL command creates a contained database user that has the same name as your Stream Analytics job. Be sure to include the brackets around the *ASA_JOB_NAME*. Use the following T-SQL syntax and run the query. 

   ```sql
   CREATE USER [ASA_JOB_NAME] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER; 
   ```

1. For Microsoft's Azure Active Directory to verify if the Stream Analytics job has access to the SQL Database, we need to give Azure Active Directory permission to communicate with the database. To do this, go to the "Firewalls and virtual network" page in Azure portal again, and enable "Allow Azure services and resources to access this server."

## Grant Stream Analytics job permissions

Once you've created a contained database user and given access to Azure services in the portal as described in the previous section, your Stream Analytics job has permission from Managed Identity to **CONNECT** to your SQL Database resource via managed identity. We recommend that you grant the SELECT and INSERT permissions to the Stream Analytics job as those will be needed later in the Stream Analytics workflow. The **SELECT** permission allows the job to test its connection to the table in the SQL Database. The **INSERT** permission allows testing end-to-end Stream Analytics queries once you have configured an input and the SQL Database output.You can grant those permissions to the Stream Analytics job using SQL Server Management Studio. For more information, see the GRANT (Transact-SQL)reference.

To only grant permission to a certain table or object in the database, use the following T-SQL syntax and run the query. 

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON OBJECT::TABLE_NAME TO ASA_JOB_NAME; 
```

Alternatively, you can right-click on your SQL database in SQL Server Management Studio and select **Properties > Permissions**. From the permissions menu, you can see the Stream Analytics job you added previously, and you can manually grant or deny permissions as you see fit.

## Create an Azure SQL Database output

Now that your managed identity is configured, you're ready to add the Azure SQL Database as output to your Stream Analytics job.

Ensure you have created a table in your SQL Database with the appropriate output schema. The name of this table is one of the required properties that has to be filled out when you add the SQL Database output to the Stream Analytics job. Also, ensure that the job has **SELECT** and **INSERT** permissions to test the connection and run Stream Analytics queries. Refer to the [Grant Stream Analytics job permissions](#grant-stream-analytics-job-permissions) section if you haven't already done so. 

1. Go back to your Stream Analytics job, and navigate to the **Outputs** page under **Job Topology**. 

1. Select **Add > SQL Database**. In the output properties window of the SQL Database output sink, select **Managed Identity** from the Authentication mode drop-down.

1. Fill out the rest of the properties. To learn more about creating an SQL Database output, see [Create a SQL Database output with Stream Analytics](sql-database-output.md). When you are finished, select **Save**. 

## Remove Managed Identity

The Managed Identity created for a Stream Analytics job is deleted only when the job is deleted. There is no way to delete the Managed Identity without deleting the job. If you no longer want to use the Managed Identity, you can change the authentication method for the output. The Managed Identity will continue to exist until the job is deleted, and will be used if you decide to used Managed Identity authentication again.
