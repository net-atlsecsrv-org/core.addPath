# Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for Azure Stream Analytics

You can deploy your Azure Stream Analytics job continuously by using source control integration. Source control integration enables a workflow in which a code update triggers a resource deployment to Azure. This article outlines the basic steps for creating a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

If you're new to Azure Stream Analytics, get started with the [Azure Stream Analytics quickstart](stream-analytics-quick-create-portal.md).

## Create a CI/CD pipeline

Follow the steps in this guide to create a CI/CD pipeline for Stream Analytics.

1. Develop an Azure Stream Analytics query.

   Use Azure Stream Analytics tools for [Visual Studio Code](quick-create-vs-code.md) or [Visual Studio](stream-analytics-quick-create-vs.md) to [develop and test queries locally](develop-locally.md). You can also [export an existing job](visual-studio-code-explore-jobs.md#export-a-job-to-a-local-project) to a local project.

2. Commit your Azure Stream Analytics projects to your source control system, like a Git repository.

3. Use [Azure Stream Analytics CI/CD tools](cicd-tools.md) to build the projects and generate Azure Resource Management Templates for the deployment.

4. Run [automated script tests](cicd-tools.md#automated-test) for quality regression.

5. [Deploy the job](cicd-tools.md#deploy-to-azure) to Azure automatically.

## Auto build, test, and deploy

You can use the command line and [Azure Stream Analytics CI/CD tools](cicd-tools.md) to auto build, test, and deploy. You can also set up a CI/CD pipeline in [Azure Pipelines](set-up-cicd-pipeline.md). Azure Pipelines to enable more advanced capabilities, such as pipeline management, visualization, and triggers.
