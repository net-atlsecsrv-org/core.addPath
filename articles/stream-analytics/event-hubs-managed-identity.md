# Use managed identities to access Event Hub from an Azure Stream Analytics job (Preview)

Azure Stream Analytics supports Managed Identity authentication for both Azure Event Hubs input and output. Managed identities eliminate the limitations of user-based authentication methods, like the need to reauthenticate because of password changes or user token expirations that occur every 90 days. When you remove the need to manually authenticate, your Stream Analytics deployments can be fully automated.  

A managed identity is a managed application registered in Azure Active Directory that represents a given Stream Analytics job. The managed application is used to authenticate to a targeted resource, including Event Hubs that are behind a firewall or virtual network (VNet). For more information about how to bypass firewalls, see [Allow access to Azure Event Hubs namespaces via private endpoints](../event-hubs/private-link-service.md#trusted-microsoft-services).

This article shows you how to enable Managed Identity for an Event Hubs input or output of a Stream Analytics job through the Azure portal. Before you enabled Managed Identity, you must first have a Stream Analytics job and Event Hub resource.

## Create a managed identity  

First, you create a managed identity for your Azure Stream Analytics job.  

1. In the Azure portal, open your Azure Stream Analytics job.  

1. From the left navigation menu, select **Managed Identity** located under *Configure*. Then, check the box next to **Use System-assigned Managed Identity** and select **Save**.

1. A service principal for the Stream Analytics job's identity is created in Azure Active Directory. The life cycle of the newly created identity is managed by Azure. When the Stream Analytics job is deleted, the associated identity (that is, the service principal) is automatically deleted by Azure.  

   When you save the configuration, the Object ID (OID) of the service principal is listed as the Principal ID as shown below:  

   :::image type="content" source="media/event-hubs-managed-identity/principal-id.png" alt-text="Principal ID":::

   The service principal has the same name as the Stream Analytics job. For example, if the name of your job is `MyASAJob`, the name of the service principal is also `MyASAJob`.  

## Grant the Stream Analytics job permissions to access the Event Hub

For the Stream Analytics job to access your Event Hub using managed identity, the service principal you created must have special permissions to the Event Hub.

1. Go to **Access Control (IAM)** in your Event Hub.

1. Select **+ Add** and **Add role assignment**.

1. On the **Add role assignment** page, enter the following options:

   |Parameter|Value|
   |---------|-----|
   |Role|Azure Event Hubs Data Owner|
   |Assign access to|User, group, or service principal|
   |Select|Enter the name of your Stream Analytics job|

   :::image type="content" source="media/event-hubs-managed-identity/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Add role assignment":::

1. Select **Save** and wait a minute or so for changes to propagate.

You can also grant this role at the Event Hub Namespace level, which will naturally propagate the permissions to all Event Hubs created under it. That is, all Event Hubs under a Namespace can be used as a managed-identity-authenticating resource in your Stream Analytics job.

## Create an Event Hub input or output  

Now that your managed identity is configured, you're ready to add the Event Hub  resource as an input or output to your Stream Analytics job.  

### Add the Event Hub as an input 

1. Go to your Stream Analytics job and navigate to the **Inputs** page under **Job Topology**.

1. Select **Add Stream Input > Event Hub**. In the input properties window, search and select your Event Hub and select **Managed Identity** from the *Authentication mode* drop-down menu.

1. Fill out the rest of the properties and select **Save**.

### Add the Event Hub as an output

1. Go to your Stream Analytics job and navigate to the **Outputs** page under **Job Topology**.

1. Select **Add > Event Hub**. In the output properties window, search and select your Event Hub and select **Managed Identity** from the *Authentication mode* drop-down menu.

1. Fill out the rest of the properties and select **Save**.
