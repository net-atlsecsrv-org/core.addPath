# Leverage query parallelization in Azure Stream Analytics
This article shows you how to take advantage of parallelization in Azure Stream Analytics. You learn how to scale Stream Analytics jobs by configuring input partitions and tuning the analytics query definition.
As a prerequisite, you may want to be familiar with the notion of Streaming Unit described in [Understand and adjust Streaming Units](stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md).

## What are the parts of a Stream Analytics job?
A Stream Analytics job definition includes at least one streaming input, a query, and output. Inputs are where the job reads the data stream from. The query is used to transform the data input stream, and the output is where the job sends the job results to.

## Partitions in inputs and outputs
Partitioning lets you divide data into subsets based on a [partition key](../event-hubs/event-hubs-scalability.md#partitions). If your input (for example Event Hubs) is partitioned by a key, it is highly recommended to specify this partition key when adding input to your Stream Analytics job. Scaling a Stream Analytics job takes advantage of partitions in the input and output. A Stream Analytics job can consume and write different partitions in parallel, which increases throughput. 

### Inputs
All Azure Stream Analytics input can take advantage of partitioning:
-	EventHub (need to set the partition key explicitly with PARTITION BY keyword if using compatibility level 1.1 or below)
-	IoT Hub  (need to set the partition key explicitly with PARTITION BY keyword if using compatibility level 1.1 or below)
-	Blob storage

### Outputs

When you work with Stream Analytics, you can take advantage of partitioning in the outputs:
-	Azure Data Lake Storage
-	Azure Functions
-	Azure Table
-	Blob storage (can set the partition key explicitly)
-	Cosmos DB  (need to set the partition key explicitly)
-	Event Hubs (need to set the partition key explicitly)
-	IoT Hub  (need to set the partition key explicitly)
-	Service Bus
- SQL and Azure Synapse Analytics with optional partitioning: see more information on the [Output to Azure SQL Database page](./stream-analytics-sql-output-perf.md).

Power BI doesn't support partitioning. However you can still partition the input as described in [this section](#multi-step-query-with-different-partition-by-values) 

For more information about partitions, see the following articles:

* [Event Hubs features overview](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features.md#partitions)
* [Data partitioning](/azure/architecture/best-practices/data-partitioning)


## Embarrassingly parallel jobs
An *embarrassingly parallel* job is the most scalable scenario in Azure Stream Analytics. It connects one partition of the input to one instance of the query to one partition of the output. This parallelism has the following requirements:

1. If your query logic depends on the same key being processed by the same query instance, you must make sure that the events go to the same partition of your input. For Event Hubs or IoT Hub, this means that the event data must have the **PartitionKey** value set. Alternatively, you can use partitioned senders. For blob storage, this means that the events are sent to the same partition folder. An example would be a query instance that aggregates data per userID where input event hub is partitioned using userID as partition key. However, if your query logic does not require the same key to be processed by the same query instance, you can ignore this requirement. An example of this logic would be a simple select-project-filter query.  

2. The next step is to make your query is partitioned. For jobs with compatibility level 1.2 or higher (recommended), custom column can be specified as Partition Key in the input settings and the job will be paralellized automatically. Jobs with compatibility level 1.0 or 1.1, requires you to use **PARTITION BY PartitionId** in all the steps of your query. Multiple steps are allowed, but they all must be partitioned by the same key. 

3. Most of the outputs supported in Stream Analytics can take advantage of partitioning. If you use an output type that doesn't support partitioning your job won't be *embarrassingly parallel*. For Event Hub outputs, ensure **Partition key column** is set to the same partition key used in the query. Refer to the [output section](#outputs) for more details.

4. The number of input partitions must equal the number of output partitions. Blob storage output can support partitions and inherits the partitioning scheme of the upstream query. When a partition key for Blob storage is specified, data is partitioned per input partition thus the result is still fully parallel. Here are examples of partition values that allow a fully parallel job:

   * 8 event hub input partitions and 8 event hub output partitions
   * 8 event hub input partitions and blob storage output
   * 8 event hub input partitions and blob storage output partitioned by a custom field with arbitrary cardinality
   * 8 blob storage input partitions and blob storage output
   * 8 blob storage input partitions and 8 event hub output partitions

The following sections discuss some example scenarios that are embarrassingly parallel.

### Simple query

* Input: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Output: Event hub with 8 partitions ("Partition key column" must be set to use "PartitionId")

Query:

```SQL
    --Using compatibility level 1.2 or above
    SELECT TollBoothId
    FROM Input1
    WHERE TollBoothId > 100
    
    --Using compatibility level 1.0 or 1.1
    SELECT TollBoothId
    FROM Input1 PARTITION BY PartitionId
    WHERE TollBoothId > 100
```

This query is a simple filter. Therefore, we don't need to worry about partitioning the input that is being sent to the event hub. Notice that jobs with compatibility level before 1.2 must include **PARTITION BY PartitionId** clause, so it fulfills requirement #2 from earlier. For the output, we need to configure the event hub output in the job to have the partition key set to **PartitionId**. One last check is to make sure that the number of input partitions is equal to the number of output partitions.

### Query with a grouping key

* Input: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Output: Blob storage

Query:

```SQL
    --Using compatibility level 1.2 or above
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Input1
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId
    
    --Using compatibility level 1.0 or 1.1
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Input1 Partition By PartitionId
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId, PartitionId
```

This query has a grouping key. Therefore, the events grouped together must be sent to the same Event Hub partition. Since in this example we group by TollBoothID, we should be sure that TollBoothID is used as the partition key when the events are sent to Event Hub. Then in ASA, we can use **PARTITION BY PartitionId** to inherit from this partition scheme and enable full parallelization. Since the output is blob storage, we don't need to worry about configuring a partition key value, as per requirement #4.

## Example of scenarios that are *not* embarrassingly parallel

In the previous section, we showed some embarrassingly parallel scenarios. In this section, we discuss scenarios that don't meet all the requirements to be embarrassingly parallel. 

### Mismatched partition count
* Input: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Output: Event hub with 32 partitions

If the input partition count doesn't match the output partition count, the topology isn't embarrassingly parallel irrespective of the query. However we can still get some level or parallelization.

### Query using non-partitioned output
* Input: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Output: Power BI

Power BI output doesn't currently support partitioning. Therefore, this scenario is not embarrassingly parallel.

### Multi-step query with different PARTITION BY values
* Input: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Output: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Compatibility level: 1.0 or 1.1

Query:

```SQL
    WITH Step1 AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId, PartitionId
    FROM Input1 Partition By PartitionId
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId, PartitionId
    )

    SELECT SUM(Count) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Step1 Partition By TollBoothId
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId
```

As you can see, the second step uses **TollBoothId** as the partitioning key. This step is not the same as the first step, and it therefore requires us to do a shuffle. 

### Multi-step query with different PARTITION BY values
* Input: Event hub with 8 partitions
* Output: Event hub with 8 partitions ("Partition key column" must be set to use "TollBoothId")
* Compatibility level - 1.2 or above

Query:

```SQL
    WITH Step1 AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Input1
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId
    )

    SELECT SUM(Count) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Step1
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId
```

Compatibility level 1.2 or above enables parallel query execution by default. For example, query from the previous section will be partitioned as long as "TollBoothId" column is set as input Partition Key. PARTITION BY PartitionId clause is not required.

## Calculate the maximum streaming units of a job
The total number of streaming units that can be used by a Stream Analytics job depends on the number of steps in the query defined for the job and the number of partitions for each step.

### Steps in a query
A query can have one or many steps. Each step is a subquery defined by the **WITH** keyword. The query that is outside the **WITH** keyword (one query only) is also counted as a step, such as the **SELECT** statement in the following query:

Query:

```SQL
    WITH Step1 AS (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
        FROM Input1 Partition By PartitionId
        GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId, PartitionId
    )
    SELECT SUM(Count) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Step1
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute,3), TollBoothId
```

This query has two steps.

> [!NOTE]
> This query is discussed in more detail later in the article.
>  

### Partition a step
Partitioning a step requires the following conditions:

* The input source must be partitioned. 
* The **SELECT** statement of the query must read from a partitioned input source.
* The query within the step must have the **PARTITION BY** keyword.

When a query is partitioned, the input events are processed and aggregated in separate partition groups, and outputs events are generated for each of the groups. If you want a combined aggregate, you must create a second non-partitioned step to aggregate.

### Calculate the max streaming units for a job
All non-partitioned steps together can scale up to six streaming units (SUs) for a Stream Analytics job. In addition to this, you can add 6 SUs for each partition in a partitioned step.
You can see some **examples** in the table below.

| Query                                               | Max SUs for the job |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| <ul><li>The query contains one step.</li><li>The step is not partitioned.</li></ul> | 6 |
| <ul><li>The input data stream is partitioned by 16.</li><li>The query contains one step.</li><li>The step is partitioned.</li></ul> | 96 (6 * 16 partitions) |
| <ul><li>The query contains two steps.</li><li>Neither of the steps is partitioned.</li></ul> | 6 |
| <ul><li>The input data stream is partitioned by 3.</li><li>The query contains two steps. The input step is partitioned and the second step is not.</li><li>The <strong>SELECT</strong> statement reads from the partitioned input.</li></ul> | 24 (18 for partitioned steps + 6 for non-partitioned steps |

### Examples of scaling

The following query calculates the number of cars within a three-minute window going through a toll station that has three tollbooths. This query can be scaled up to six SUs.

```SQL
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Input1
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId, PartitionId
```

To use more SUs for the query, both the input data stream and the query must be partitioned. Since the data stream partition is set to 3, the following modified query can be scaled up to 18 SUs:

```SQL
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Input1 Partition By PartitionId
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId, PartitionId
```

When a query is partitioned, the input events are processed and aggregated in separate partition groups. Output events are also generated for each of the groups. Partitioning can cause some unexpected results when the **GROUP BY** field is not the partition key in the input data stream. For example, the **TollBoothId** field in the previous query is not the partition key of **Input1**. The result is that the data from TollBooth #1 can be spread in multiple partitions.

Each of the **Input1** partitions will be processed separately by Stream Analytics. As a result, multiple records of the car count for the same tollbooth in the same Tumbling window will be created. If the input partition key can't be changed, this problem can be fixed by adding a non-partition step to aggregate values across partitions, as in the following example:

```SQL
    WITH Step1 AS (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS Count, TollBoothId
        FROM Input1 Partition By PartitionId
        GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId, PartitionId
    )

    SELECT SUM(Count) AS Count, TollBoothId
    FROM Step1
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 3), TollBoothId
```

This query can be scaled to 24 SUs.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are joining two streams, make sure that the streams are partitioned by the partition key of the column that you use to create the joins. Also make sure that you have the same number of partitions in both streams.

## Achieving higher throughputs at scale

An [embarrassingly parallel](#embarrassingly-parallel-jobs) job is necessary but not sufficient to sustain a higher throughput at scale. Every storage system and its corresponding Stream Analytics output has variations on how to achieve the best possible write throughput. As with any at-scale scenario, there are some challenges which can be solved by using the right configurations. This section discusses configurations for a few common outputs and provides samples for sustaining ingestion rates of 1K, 5K and 10K events per second.

The following observations use a Stream Analytics job with stateless (passthrough) query, a basic JavaScript UDF which writes to Event Hub, Azure SQL DB, or Cosmos DB.

#### Event Hub

|Ingestion Rate (events per second) | Streaming Units | Output Resources  |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1K     |    1    |  2 TU   |
| 5K     |    6    |  6 TU   |
| 10K    |    12   |  10 TU  |

The [Event Hub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/streaming-at-scale/tree/main/eventhubs-streamanalytics-eventhubs) solution scales linearly in terms of streaming units (SU) and throughput, making it the most efficient and performant way to analyze and stream data out of Stream Analytics. Jobs can be scaled up to 192 SU, which roughly translates to processing up to 200 MB/s, or 19 trillion events per day.

#### Azure SQL
|Ingestion Rate (events per second) | Streaming Units | Output Resources  |
|---------|------|-------|
|    1K   |   3  |  S3   |
|    5K   |   18 |  P4   |
|    10K  |   36 |  P6   |

[Azure SQL](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/streaming-at-scale/tree/main/eventhubs-streamanalytics-azuresql)  supports writing in parallel, called Inherit Partitioning, but it's not enabled by default. However, enabling Inherit Partitioning, along with a fully parallel query, may not be sufficient to achieve higher throughputs. SQL write throughputs depend significantly on your database configuration and table schema. The [SQL Output Performance](./stream-analytics-sql-output-perf.md) article has more detail about the parameters that can maximize your write throughput. As noted in the [Azure Stream Analytics output to Azure SQL Database](./stream-analytics-sql-output-perf.md#azure-stream-analytics) article, this solution doesn't scale linearly as a fully parallel pipeline beyond 8 partitions and may need repartitioning before SQL output (see [INTO](/stream-analytics-query/into-azure-stream-analytics#into-shard-count)). Premium SKUs are needed to sustain high IO rates along with overhead from log backups happening every few minutes.

#### Cosmos DB
|Ingestion Rate (events per second) | Streaming Units | Output Resources  |
|-------|-------|---------|
|  1K   |  3    | 20K RU  |
|  5K   |  24   | 60K RU  |
|  10K  |  48   | 120K RU |

[Cosmos DB](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/streaming-at-scale/tree/main/eventhubs-streamanalytics-cosmosdb) output from Stream Analytics has been updated to use native integration under [compatibility level 1.2](./stream-analytics-documentdb-output.md#improved-throughput-with-compatibility-level-12). Compatibility level 1.2 enables significantly higher throughput and reduces RU consumption compared to 1.1, which is the default compatibility level for new jobs. The solution uses CosmosDB containers partitioned on /deviceId and the rest of solution is identically configured.

All [Streaming at Scale Azure samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/streaming-at-scale) use an Event Hub as input that is fed by load simulating test clients. Each input event is a 1KB JSON document, which translates configured ingestion rates to throughput rates (1MB/s, 5MB/s and 10MB/s) easily. Events simulate an IoT device sending the following JSON data (in a shortened form) for up to 1K devices:

```
{
    "eventId": "b81d241f-5187-40b0-ab2a-940faf9757c0",
    "complexData": {
        "moreData0": 51.3068118685458,
        "moreData22": 45.34076957651598
    },
    "value": 49.02278128887753,
    "deviceId": "contoso://device-id-1554",
    "type": "CO2",
    "createdAt": "2019-05-16T17:16:40.000003Z"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The configurations are subject to change due to the various components used in the solution. For a more accurate estimate, customize the samples to fit your scenario.

### Identifying Bottlenecks

Use the Metrics pane in your Azure Stream Analytics job to identify bottlenecks in your pipeline. Review **Input/Output Events** for throughput and ["Watermark Delay"](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/new-metric-in-azure-stream-analytics-tracks-latency-of-your-streaming-pipeline/) or **Backlogged Events** to see if the job is keeping up with the input rate. For Event Hub metrics, look for **Throttled Requests** and adjust the Threshold Units accordingly. For Cosmos DB metrics, review **Max consumed RU/s per partition key range** under Throughput to ensure your partition key ranges are uniformly consumed. For Azure SQL DB, monitor **Log IO** and **CPU**.
