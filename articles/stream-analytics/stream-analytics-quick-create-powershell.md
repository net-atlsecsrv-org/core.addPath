# Quickstart: Create a Stream Analytics job using Azure PowerShell

The Azure PowerShell module is used to create and manage Azure resources using PowerShell cmdlets or scripts. This quickstart details using the Azure PowerShell module to deploy and run an Azure Stream Analytics job.

The example job reads streaming data from an IoT Hub device. The input data is generated by a Raspberry Pi online simulator. Next, the Stream Analytics job transforms the data using the Stream Analytics query language to filter messages with a temperature greater than 27°. Finally, it writes the resulting output events into a file in blob storage.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

* This quickstart requires the Azure PowerShell module. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the version that is installed on your local machine. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps).

* Some IoT Hub actions are not supported by Azure PowerShell and must be completed using Azure CLI version 2.0.70 or later and the IoT extension for Azure CLI. [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) and use `az extension add --name azure-iot` to install the IoT extension.


## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to your Azure subscription with the `Connect-AzAccount` command, and enter your Azure credentials in the pop-up browser:

```powershell
# Connect to your Azure account
Connect-AzAccount
```

If you have more than one subscription, select the subscription you would like to use for this quickstart by running the following cmdlets. Make sure to replace `<your subscription name>` with the name of your subscription:

```powershell
# List all available subscriptions.
Get-AzSubscription

# Select the Azure subscription you want to use to create the resource group and resources.
Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "<your subscription name>" | Select-AzSubscription
```

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "StreamAnalyticsRG"
$location = "WestUS2"
New-AzResourceGroup `
    -Name $resourceGroup `
    -Location $location
```

## Prepare the input data

Before defining the Stream Analytics job, prepare the data that is configured as input to the job.

The following Azure CLI code block does many commands to prepare the input data required by the job. Review the sections to understand the code.

1. In your PowerShell window, run the [az login](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) command to sign in to your Azure account.

    When you successfully sign in, Azure CLI returns a list of your subscriptions. Copy the subscription you're using for this quickstart and run the [az account set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest#change-the-active-subscription) command to select that subscription. Choose the same subscription you selected in the previous section with PowerShell. Make sure to replace `<your subscription name>` with the name of your subscription.

    ```azurecli
    az login

    az account set --subscription "<your subscription>"
    ```

2. Create an IoT Hub using the [az iot hub create](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-cli.md#create-an-iot-hub) command. This example creates an IoT Hub called **MyASAIoTHub**. Because IoT Hub names are unique, you need to come up with your own IoT Hub name. Set the SKU to F1 to use the free tier if it is available with your subscription. If not, choose the next lowest tier.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub create --name "<your IoT Hub name>" --resource-group $resourceGroup --sku S1
    ```

    Once the IoT hub has been created, get the IoT Hub connection string using the [az iot hub show-connection-string](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/iot/hub?view=azure-cli-latest) command. Copy the entire connection string and save it for when you add the IoT Hub as input to your Stream Analytics job.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub show-connection-string --hub-name "MyASAIoTHub"
    ```

3. Add a device to IoT Hub using the [az iothub device-identity create](../iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-c.md#register-a-device) command. This example creates a device called **MyASAIoTDevice**.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name "MyASAIoTHub" --device-id "MyASAIoTDevice"
    ```

4. Get the device connection string using the [az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot/hub/device-identity#ext-azure-iot-az-iot-hub-device-identity-show-connection-string) command. Copy the entire connection string and save it for when you create the Raspberry Pi simulator.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name "MyASAIoTHub" --device-id "MyASAIoTDevice" --output table
    ```

    **Output example:**

    ```output
    HostName=MyASAIoTHub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyASAIoTDevice;SharedAccessKey=a2mnUsg52+NIgYudxYYUNXI67r0JmNubmfVafojG8=
    ```

## Create blob storage

The following Azure PowerShell code block uses commands to create blob storage that is used for job output. Review the sections to understand the code.

1. Create a standard general-purpose storage account using [New-AzStorageAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/New-azStorageAccount) cmdlet.  This example creates a storage account called **myasaquickstartstorage** with locally redundant storage(LRS) and blob encryption (enabled by default).

2. Retrieve the storage account context `$storageAccount.Context` that defines the storage account to be used. When working with storage accounts, you reference the context instead of repeatedly providing the credentials.

3. Create a storage container using [New-AzStorageContainer](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstoragecontainer).

4. Copy the storage key that is outputted by the code, and save that key to create the streaming job's output later on.

    ```powershell
    $storageAccountName = "myasaquickstartstorage"
    $storageAccount = New-AzStorageAccount `
      -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
      -Name $storageAccountName `
      -Location $location `
      -SkuName Standard_LRS `
      -Kind Storage

    $ctx = $storageAccount.Context
    $containerName = "container1"

    New-AzStorageContainer `
      -Name $containerName `
      -Context $ctx

    $storageAccountKey = (Get-AzStorageAccountKey `
      -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
      -Name $storageAccountName).Value[0]

    Write-Host "The <storage account key> placeholder needs to be replaced in your output json files with this key value:"
    Write-Host $storageAccountKey -ForegroundColor Cyan
    ```

## Create a Stream Analytics job

Create a Stream Analytics job with [New-AzStreamAnalyticsJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.streamanalytics/new-azstreamanalyticsjob) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, resource group name, and job definition as parameters. The job name can be any friendly name that identifies your job. It can have alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only and it must be between 3 and 63 characters long. The job definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to create a job. On your local machine, create a file named `JobDefinition.json` and add the following JSON data to it:

```json
{
  "location":"WestUS2",
  "properties":{
    "sku":{
      "name":"standard"
    },
    "eventsOutOfOrderPolicy":"adjust",
    "eventsOutOfOrderMaxDelayInSeconds":10,
    "compatibilityLevel": 1.1
  }
}
```

Next, run the `New-AzStreamAnalyticsJob` cmdlet. Replace the value of `jobDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you've stored the job definition JSON file.

```powershell
$jobName = "MyStreamingJob"
$jobDefinitionFile = "C:\JobDefinition.json"
New-AzStreamAnalyticsJob `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -File $jobDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobName `
  -Force
```

## Configure input to the job

Add an input to your job by using the [New-AzStreamAnalyticsInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.streamanalytics/new-azstreamanalyticsinput) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job input name, resource group name, and the job input definition as parameters. The job input definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to configure the job’s input. In this example, you'll create a blob storage as an input.

On your local machine, create a file named `JobInputDefinition.json` and add the following JSON data to it. Make sure to replace the value for `accesspolicykey` with the `SharedAccessKey` portion of the IoT Hub connection string you saved in a previous section.

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "type": "Stream",
        "datasource": {
            "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs",
            "properties": {
                "iotHubNamespace": "MyASAIoTHub",
                "sharedAccessPolicyName": "iothubowner",
                "sharedAccessPolicyKey": "accesspolicykey",
                "endpoint": "messages/events",
                "consumerGroupName": "$Default"
                }
        },
        "compression": {
            "type": "None"
        },
        "serialization": {
            "type": "Json",
            "properties": {
                "encoding": "UTF8"
            }
        }
    },
    "name": "IoTHubInput",
    "type": "Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/inputs"
}
```

Next, run the `New-AzStreamAnalyticsInput` cmdlet, make sure to replace the value of `jobDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you've stored the job input definition JSON file.

```powershell
$jobInputName = "IoTHubInput"
$jobInputDefinitionFile = "C:\JobInputDefinition.json"
New-AzStreamAnalyticsInput `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -JobName $jobName `
  -File $jobInputDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobInputName
```

## Configure output to the job

Add an output to your job by using the [New-AzStreamAnalyticsOutput](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.streamanalytics/new-azstreamanalyticsoutput) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job output name, resource group name, and the job output definition as parameters. The job output definition is a JSON file that contains the properties required to configure job’s output. This example uses blob storage as output.

On your local machine, create a file named `JobOutputDefinition.json`, and add the following JSON data to it. Make sure to replace the value for `accountKey` with your storage account’s access key that is the value stored in $storageAccountKey value.

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "datasource": {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/Blob",
            "properties": {
                "storageAccounts": [
                    {
                      "accountName": "asaquickstartstorage",
                      "accountKey": "<storage account key>"
                    }
                ],
                "container": "container1",
                "pathPattern": "output/",
                "dateFormat": "yyyy/MM/dd",
                "timeFormat": "HH"
            }
        },
        "serialization": {
            "type": "Json",
            "properties": {
                "encoding": "UTF8",
                "format": "LineSeparated"
            }
        }
    },
    "name": "BlobOutput",
    "type": "Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/outputs"
}
```

Next, run the `New-AzStreamAnalyticsOutput` cmdlet. Make sure to replace the value of `jobOutputDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you have stored the job output definition JSON file.

```powershell
$jobOutputName = "BlobOutput"
$jobOutputDefinitionFile = "C:\JobOutputDefinition.json"
New-AzStreamAnalyticsOutput `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -JobName $jobName `
  -File $jobOutputDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobOutputName -Force
```

## Define the transformation query

Add a transformation your job by using the [New-AzStreamAnalyticsTransformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.streamanalytics/new-azstreamanalyticstransformation) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, job transformation name, resource group name, and the job transformation definition as parameters. On your local machine, create a file named `JobTransformationDefinition.json` and add the following JSON data to it. The JSON file contains a query parameter that defines the transformation query:

```json
{
    "name":"MyTransformation",
    "type":"Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/transformations",
    "properties":{
        "streamingUnits":1,
        "script":null,
        "query":" SELECT * INTO BlobOutput FROM IoTHubInput HAVING Temperature > 27"
    }
}
```

Next run the `New-AzStreamAnalyticsTransformation` cmdlet. Make sure to replace the value of `jobTransformationDefinitionFile` variable with the path where you've stored the job transformation definition JSON file.

```powershell
$jobTransformationName = "MyJobTransformation"
$jobTransformationDefinitionFile = "C:\JobTransformationDefinition.json"
New-AzStreamAnalyticsTransformation `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -JobName $jobName `
  -File $jobTransformationDefinitionFile `
  -Name $jobTransformationName -Force
```

## Run the IoT simulator

1. Open the [Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Online Simulator](https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/).

2. Replace the placeholder in Line 15 with the entire Azure IoT Hub Device connection string you saved in a previous section.

3. Click **Run**. The output should show the sensor data and messages that are being sent to your IoT Hub.

    ![Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Online Simulator](./media/stream-analytics-quick-create-powershell/ras-pi-connection-string.png)

## Start the Stream Analytics job and check the output

Start the job by using the [Start-AzStreamAnalyticsJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.streamanalytics/start-azstreamanalyticsjob) cmdlet. This cmdlet takes the job name, resource group name, output start mode, and start time as parameters. `OutputStartMode` accepts values of `JobStartTime`, `CustomTime`, or `LastOutputEventTime`. To learn more about what each of these values are referring to, see the [parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.streamanalytics/start-azstreamanalyticsjob) section in PowerShell documentation.

After you run the following cmdlet, it returns `True` as output if the job starts. In the storage container, an output folder is created with the transformed data.

```powershell
Start-AzStreamAnalyticsJob `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Name $jobName `
  -OutputStartMode 'JobStartTime'
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, the streaming job, and all related resources. Deleting the job avoids billing the streaming units consumed by the job. If you're planning to use the job in future, you can skip deleting it, and stop the job for now. If you aren't going to continue to use this job, delete all resources created by this quickstart by running the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup `
  -Name $resourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple Stream Analytics job using PowerShell. You can also deploy Stream Analytics jobs using the [Azure portal](stream-analytics-quick-create-portal.md) and [Visual Studio](stream-analytics-quick-create-vs.md).
