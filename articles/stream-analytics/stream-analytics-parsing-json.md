# Parse JSON and Avro data in Azure Stream Analytics

Azure Stream Analytics supports processing events in CSV, JSON, and Avro data formats. Both JSON and Avro data can contain complex types such as nested objects (records) and arrays.

## Array data types
Array data types are an ordered collection of values. Some typical operations on array values are detailed below. These examples assume the input events have a property named "arrayField" that is  an array datatype.

These examples use the functions [GetArrayElement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/getarrayelement-azure-stream-analytics), [GetArrayElements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/getarrayelements-azure-stream-analytics), [GetArrayLength](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/getarraylength-azure-stream-analytics), and the [APPLY](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/apply-azure-stream-analytics) operator.

## Examples
Select array element at a specified index (selecting the first array element):

```SQL
SELECT
    GetArrayElement(arrayField, 0) AS firstElement
FROM input
```

Select array length:

```SQL
SELECT
    GetArrayLength(arrayField) AS arrayLength
FROM input
```

Select all array element as individual events. The [APPLY](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/apply-azure-stream-analytics) operator together with the [GetArrayElements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/getarrayelements-azure-stream-analytics) built-in function extracts all array elements as individual events:

```SQL
SELECT
    arrayElement.ArrayIndex,
    arrayElement.ArrayValue
FROM input as event
CROSS APPLY GetArrayElements(event.arrayField) AS arrayElement
```

## Record data types
Record data types are used to represent JSON and Avro arrays when corresponding formats are used in the input data streams. These examples demonstrate a sample sensor, which is reading input events in JSON format. Here is example of a single event:

```json
{
    "DeviceId" : "12345",
    "Location" :
    {
        "Lat": 47,
        "Long": 122
    },
    "SensorReadings" :
    {
        "Temperature" : 80,
        "Humidity" : 70,
        "CustomSensor01" : 5,
        "CustomSensor02" : 99
    }
}
```

## Examples
Use dot notation (.) to access nested fields. For example, this query selects the Lat and Long coordinates under the Location property in the preceding JSON data:

```SQL
SELECT
    DeviceID,
    Location.Lat,
    Location.Long
FROM input
```

Use the [GetRecordPropertyValue](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/getrecordpropertyvalue-azure-stream-analytics) function if the property name is unknown. For example, imagine a sample data stream needs to be joined with reference data containing thresholds for each device sensor:

```json
{
    "DeviceId" : "12345",
    "SensorName" : "Temperature",
    "Value" : 75
}
```

```SQL
SELECT
    input.DeviceID,
    thresholds.SensorName
FROM input
JOIN thresholds
ON
    input.DeviceId = thresholds.DeviceId
WHERE
    GetRecordPropertyValue(input.SensorReadings, thresholds.SensorName) > thresholds.Value
```

To convert record fields into separate events, use the [APPLY](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/apply-azure-stream-analytics) operator together with the [GetRecordProperties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/reference/getrecordproperties-azure-stream-analytics) function. For example, to convert a sample stream into a stream of events with individual sensor readings, this query could be used:

```SQL
SELECT
    event.DeviceID,
    sensorReading.PropertyName,
    sensorReading.PropertyValue
FROM input as event
CROSS APPLY GetRecordProperties(event.SensorReadings) AS sensorReading
```

You can select all the properties of a nested record using '*' wildcard. Consider the following example:

```SQL
SELECT input.SensorReadings.*
FROM input
```

The result is:

```json
{
    "Temperature" : 80,
    "Humidity" : 70,
    "CustomSensor01" : 5,
    "CustomSensor022" : 99
}
```
