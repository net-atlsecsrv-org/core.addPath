* [Rotate login credentials for inputs and outputs of a Stream Analytics job](./stream-analytics-login-credentials-inputs-outputs.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create an identity management and role security plan, following best practices including the principle of least privileged access for administrator roles. Use Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources. Use Azure PIM alerts and audit history to monitor the activity of administrative accounts. Use Azure AD security reports to help identify administrative accounts that might have been compromised.

* [Learn more](../active-directory/privileged-identity-management/index.yml)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.4: Use single sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory

The internal data including User-defined functions, queries, data snapshots is stored in the configured storage account which you can backup on a regular basis.

The data in your Microsoft Azure storage account is always automatically replicated to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage copies your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. You can choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, or across geographically separated regions.

You can also use lifecycle management feature to backup data to the Archive tier. Additionally, enable soft delete for your backups stored in Storage account.

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: The internal data including User-defined functions, queries, data snapshots is stored in the configured storage account which you can backup on a regular basis.

In order to backup data from Storage account supported services, there are multiple methods available including using azcopy or third-party tools. Immutable storage for Azure Blob storage enables users to store business-critical data objects in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state. This state makes the data non-erasable and non-modifiable for a user-specified interval.

* [Set and manage immutability policies for Blob storage](../storage/blobs/storage-blob-immutability-policies-manage.md?tabs=azure-portal)

Customer-managed / provided keys can be backed within Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI or PowerShell.

### 9.3: Validate all backups including customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Periodically perform data restoration of your backup data to test the integrity of the data.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Stream Analytics backups stored within your Azure Storage supports encryption by default and cannot be turned off. You should treat your backups as sensitive data and apply the relevant access and data protection controls as part of this baseline.

## Incident response

*For more information, see [Security control: Incident response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

* [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

* [Microsoft Security Response Center's Anatomy of an Incident](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/06/27/inside-the-msrc-anatomy-of-a-ssirp-incident/)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

* [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems' incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

* [Refer to NIST's publication: Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-84.pdf)

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

* [How to set the Azure Security Center Security Contact](../security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

### 10.6: Automate the response to security alerts

**Guidance**: Use the Workflow Automation feature in Azure Security Center to automatically trigger responses via "Logic Apps" on security alerts and recommendations to protect your Azure resources.

## Penetration tests and red team exercises

*For more information, see [Security control: Penetration tests and red team exercises](../security/benchmarks/security-control-penetration-tests-red-team-exercises.md).*

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

**Guidance**: 

* [Follow the Microsoft Rules of Engagement to ensure your Penetration Tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement?rtc=1)

* [You can find more information on Microsoft's strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications, here](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Cloud-Red-Teaming-b837392e)
