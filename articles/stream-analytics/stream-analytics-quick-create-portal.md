# Quickstart: Create a Stream Analytics job by using the Azure portal

This quickstart shows you how to get started with creating a Stream Analytics job. In this quickstart, you define a Stream Analytics job that reads real-time streaming data and filters messages with a temperature greater than 27. Your Stream Analytics job will read data from an IoT Hub device, transform the data, and write the data back to a container in blob storage. The input data used in this quickstart is generated by a Raspberry Pi online simulator. 

## Before you begin

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Prepare the input data

Before defining the Stream Analytics job, you should prepare the data, which is later configured as the job input. To prepare the input data required by the job, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **Create a resource** > **Internet of Things** > **IoT Hub**.

3. In the **IoT Hub** pane, enter the following information:
   
   |**Setting**  |**Suggested value**  |**Description**  |
   |---------|---------|---------|
   |Subscription  | \<Your subscription\> |  Select the Azure subscription that you want to use. |
   |Resource group   |   asaquickstart-resourcegroup  |   Select **Create New** and enter a new resource-group name for your account. |
   |Region  |  \<Select the region that is closest to your users\> | Select a geographic location where you can host your IoT Hub. Use the location that's closest to your users. |
   |IoT Hub Name  | MyASAIoTHub  |   Select a name for your IoT Hub.   |

## Create a Stream Analytics job

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Select **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.  

3. Select **Analytics** > **Stream Analytics job** from the results list.  

4. Fill out the Stream Analytics job page with the following information:

   |**Setting**  |**Suggested value**  |**Description**  |
   |---------|---------|---------|
   |Job name   |  MyASAJob   |   Enter a name to identify your Stream Analytics job. Stream Analytics job name can contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only and it must be between 3 and 63 characters long. |
   |Subscription  | \<Your subscription\> |  Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for this job. |
   |Resource group   |   asaquickstart-resourcegroup  |   Select the same resource group as your IoT Hub. |
   |Location  |  \<Select the region that is closest to your users\> | Select geographic location where you can host your Stream Analytics job. Use the location that's closest to your users for better performance and to reduce the data transfer cost. |
   |Streaming units  | 1  |   Streaming units represent the computing resources that are required to execute a job. By default, this value is set to 1. To learn about scaling streaming units, refer to [understanding and adjusting streaming units](stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md) article.   |
   |Hosting environment  |  Cloud  |   Stream Analytics jobs can be deployed to cloud or edge. Cloud allows you to deploy to Azure Cloud, and Edge allows you to deploy to an IoT Edge device. |

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, the streaming job, and all related resources. Deleting the job avoids billing the streaming units consumed by the job. If you're planning to use the job in future, you can stop it and restart it later when you need. If you are not going to continue to use this job, delete all resources created by this quickstart by using the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** and then select the name of the resource you created.  

2. On your resource group page, select **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple Stream Analytics job using Azure portal. You can also deploy Stream Analytics jobs using [PowerShell](stream-analytics-quick-create-powershell.md), [Visual Studio](stream-analytics-quick-create-vs.md), and [Visual Studio Code](quick-create-vs-code.md).
