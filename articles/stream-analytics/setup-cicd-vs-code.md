# Use the Stream Analytics CI/CD npm package
This article describes how to use the Azure Stream Analytics CI/CD npm package to set up a continuous integration and deployment process.

## Build the VS Code project

You can enable continuous integration and deployment for Azure Stream Analytics jobs using the **asa-streamanalytics-cicd** npm package. The npm package provides the tools to generate Azure Resource Manager templates of [Stream Analytics Visual Studio Code projects](quick-create-vs-code.md). It can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux without installing Visual Studio Code.

Once you have [downloaded the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-streamanalytics-cicd), use the following command to output the Azure Resource Manager templates. The **scriptPath** argument is the absolute path to the **asaql** file in your project. Make sure the asaproj.json and JobConfig.json files are in the same folder with the script file. If the **outputPath** is not specified, the templates will be placed in the **Deploy** folder under the project's **bin** folder.

```powershell
azure-streamanalytics-cicd build -scriptPath <scriptFullPath> -outputPath <outputPath>
```
Example (on macOS)
```powershell
azure-streamanalytics-cicd build -scriptPath "/Users/roger/projects/samplejob/script.asaql" 
```

When a Stream Analytics Visual Studio Code project builds successfully, it generates the following two Azure Resource Manager template files under the **bin/[Debug/Retail]/Deploy** folder: 

*  Resource Manager template file

       [ProjectName].JobTemplate.json 

*  Resource Manager parameters file

       [ProjectName].JobTemplate.parameters.json   

The default parameters in the parameters.json file are from the settings in your Visual Studio Code project. If you want to deploy to another environment, replace the parameters accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> For all the credentials, the default values are set to null. You are **required** to set the values before you deploy to the cloud.

```json
"Input_EntryStream_sharedAccessPolicyKey": {
      "value": null
    },
```

Learn more about how to [use an object as a parameter in a Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/building-blocks/extending-templates/objects-as-parameters).

To use Managed Identity for Azure Data Lake Store Gen1 as output sink, you need to provide Access to the service principal using PowerShell before deploying to Azure.
