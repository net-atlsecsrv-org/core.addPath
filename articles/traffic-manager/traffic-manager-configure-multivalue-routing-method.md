# Configure MultiValue routing method in Traffic Manager

This article describes how to configure the MultiValue traffic-routing method. The **Multivalue** traffic routing method allows you to return multiple healthy endpoints and helps increase the reliability of your application since clients have more options to retry without having to do another DNS lookup. MultiValue routing is enabled only for profiles which have all their endpoints specified using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. 
When a query is received for this profile, all healthy endpoints are returned based on the configurable maximum return count specified. 

>[!NOTE]
> At this time adding endpoints using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses is supported only for endpoints of type **External** and hence MultiValue routing is also supported only for such endpoints.

## Sign in to Azure 

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.
## Create a resource group
Create a resource group for the Traffic Manager profile.
1. On the left pane of the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**.
2. In **Resource groups**, on the top of the page, select **Add**.
3. In **Resource group name**, type a name *myResourceGroupTM1*. For **Resource group location**, select **East US**, and then select **OK**.

## Create a Traffic Manager profile
Create a Traffic Manager profile that directs user traffic by sending them to the endpoint with lowest latency.

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Traffic Manager profile** > **Create**.
2. In **Create Traffic Manager profile**, enter or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Create**:
    
	| Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Name                   | This name needs to be unique within the trafficmanager.net zone and results in the DNS name, trafficmanager.net that is used to access your Traffic Manager profile.                                   |
    | Routing method          | Select the **Multivalue** routing method.                                       |
    | Subscription            | Select your subscription.                          |
    | Resource group          | Select *myResourceGroupTM1*. |
    | Location                | This setting refers to the location of the resource group, and has no impact on the Traffic Manager profile that will be deployed globally.                              |
   |        |           |

## Add Traffic Manager endpoints

Add two IP addresses as external endpoints to the MultiValue Traffic Manager profile that you created in the preceding step.

1. In the portalâ€™s search bar, search for the Traffic Manager profile name that you created in the preceding section and select the profile in the results that the displayed.
2. In **Traffic Manager profile**, in the **Settings** section, click **Endpoints**, and then click **Add**.
3. Enter, or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **OK**:

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Type                    | External endpoint                                   |
    | Name           | myEndpoint1                                        |
    | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP           | Type the Public IP address of the endpoint that you want to add to this Traffic Manager profile                         |
    |        |           |

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add another endpoint named *myEndpoint2*, for **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP**, enter the public IP address of the second endpoint.
5. When the addition of both endpoints is complete, they are displayed in **Traffic Manager profile** along with their monitoring status as **Online**.
