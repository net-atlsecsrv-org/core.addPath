# Azure security baseline for Azure Traffic Manager

The Azure Security Baseline for Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Traffic Manager. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Traffic Manager have been excluded.

To see how Azure Traffic Manager completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Traffic Manager security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: The Activity log is an Azure platform log that provides insight into subscription-level events. Send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on your Azure Traffic Manager resources at the control plane level. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Traffic Manager profiles.

Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. Alternatively, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.
