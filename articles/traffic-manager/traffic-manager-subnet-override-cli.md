# Traffic Manager subnet override using Azure CLI

Traffic Manager subnet override allows you to alter the routing method of a profile.  The addition of an override will direct traffic based upon the end user's IP address with a predefined IP range to endpoint mapping. 

## How subnet override works

When subnet overrides are added to a traffic manager profile, Traffic Manager will first check if there's a subnet override for the end user’s IP address. If one is found, the user’s DNS query will be directed to the corresponding endpoint.  If a mapping is not found, Traffic Manager will fall back to the profile’s original routing method. 

The IP address ranges can be specified as either CIDR ranges (for example, 1.2.3.0/24) or as address ranges (for example, 1.2.3.4-5.6.7.8). The IP ranges associated with each endpoint must be unique to that endpoint. Any overlap of IP ranges among different endpoints will cause the profile to be rejected by Traffic Manager.

There are two types of routing profiles that support subnet overrides:

* **Geographic** - If Traffic Manager finds a subnet override for the DNS query's IP address, it will route the query to the endpoint whatever the health of the endpoint is.
* **Performance** - If Traffic Manager finds a subnet override for the DNS query's IP address, it will only route the traffic to the endpoint if it's healthy.  Traffic Manager will fall back to the performance routing heuristic if the subnet override endpoint isn't healthy.

## Create a Traffic Manager subnet override

To create a Traffic Manager subnet override, you can use Azure CLI to add the subnets for the override to the Traffic Manager endpoint.

## Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running a version of the Azure CLI version 2.0.28 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update the Traffic Manager endpoint with subnet override.
Use Azure CLI to update your endpoint with [az network traffic-manager endpoint update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/traffic-manager/endpoint?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-traffic-manager-endpoint-update).

```azurecli-interactive
### Add a range of IPs ###
az network traffic-manager endpoint update \
    --name MyEndpoint \
    --profile-name MyTmProfile \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --subnets 1.2.3.4-5.6.7.8 \
    --type AzureEndpoints

### Add a subnet ###
az network traffic-manager endpoint update \
    --name MyEndpoint \
    --profile-name MyTmProfile \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --subnets 9.10.11.0:24 \
    --type AzureEndpoints
```

You can remove the IP address ranges by running the [az network traffic-manager endpoint update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/traffic-manager/endpoint?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-traffic-manager-endpoint-update) with the **--remove** option.

```azurecli-interactive
az network traffic-manager endpoint update \
    --name MyEndpoint \
    --profile-name MyTmProfile \
    --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
    --remove subnets \
    --type AzureEndpoints
```
