# Get started with Storage Explorer

## Overview

Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone app that makes it easy to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

In this article, you'll learn several ways of connecting to and managing your Azure storage accounts.

## Prerequisites

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

The following versions of Windows support Storage Explorer:

* Windows 10 (recommended)
* Windows 8
* Windows 7

For all versions of Windows, Storage Explorer requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 at a minimum.

# [macOS](#tab/macos)

The following versions of macOS support Storage Explorer:

* macOS 10.12 Sierra and later versions

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

Storage Explorer is available in the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/storage-explorer) for most common distributions of Linux. We recommend Snap Store for this installation. The Storage Explorer snap installs all of its dependencies and updates when new versions are published to the Snap Store.

For supported distributions, see the [`snapd` installation page](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

Storage Explorer requires the use of a password manager. You might have to connect to a password manager manually. You can connect Storage Explorer to your system's password manager by running the following command:

```bash
snap connect storage-explorer:password-manager-service :password-manager-service
```

Storage Explorer is also available as a *.tar.gz* download. If you use the *.tar.gz*, you must install dependencies manually. The following distributions of Linux support *.tar.gz* installation:

* Ubuntu 20.04 x64
* Ubuntu 18.04 x64
* Ubuntu 16.04 x64

The *.tar.gz* installation might work on other distributions, but only these listed ones are officially supported.

For more help installing Storage Explorer on Linux, see [Linux dependencies](./storage/common/storage-explorer-troubleshooting.md#linux-dependencies) in the Azure Storage Explorer troubleshooting guide.

## Download and install

To download and install Storage Explorer, see [Azure Storage Explorer](https://www.storageexplorer.com).

## Connect to a storage account or service

Storage Explorer provides several ways to connect to Azure resources:

* [Sign in to Azure to access your subscriptions and their resources](#sign-in-to-azure)
* [Attach to an individual Azure Storage resource](#attach-to-an-individual-resource)
* [Attach to a CosmosDB resource](#connect-to-azure-cosmos-db)

### Sign in to Azure

> [!NOTE]
> To fully access resources after you sign in, Storage Explorer requires both management (Azure Resource Manager) and data layer permissions. This means that you need Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) permissions to access your storage account, the containers in the account, and the data in the containers. If you have permissions only at the data layer, consider choosing the **Sign in using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** option when attaching to a resource. For more information about the specific permissions Storage Explorer requires, see the [Azure Storage Explorer troubleshooting guide](./storage/common/storage-explorer-troubleshooting.md#azure-rbac-permissions-issues).

1. In Storage Explorer, select **View** > **Account Management** or select the **Manage Accounts** button.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Manage Accounts" source ="./vs-storage-explorer-manage-accounts.png":::

1. **ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT** now displays all the Azure accounts you're signed in to. To connect to another account, select **Add an account...**.

1. The **Connect to Azure Storage** dialog opens. In the **Select Resource** panel, select **Subscription**.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Connect dialog" source="./vs-storage-explorer-connect-dialog.png":::

1. In the **Select Azure Environment** panel, select an Azure environment to sign in to. You can sign in to global Azure, a national cloud or an Azure Stack instance. Then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Option to sign in" source="./vs-storage-explorer-connect-environment.png":::

    > [!TIP]
    > For more information about Azure Stack, see [Connect Storage Explorer to an Azure Stack subscription or storage account](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-storage-connect-se).

1. Storage Explorer will open a webpage for you to sign in.

1. After you successfully sign in with an Azure account, the account and the Azure subscriptions associated with that account appear under **ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT**. Select the Azure subscriptions that you want to work with, and then select **Apply**.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Select Azure subscriptions" source="./vs-storage-explorer-account-panel.png":::

1. **EXPLORER** displays the storage accounts associated with the selected Azure subscriptions.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Selected Azure subscriptions" source="./vs-storage-explorer-subscription-node.png":::

### Attach to an individual resource

Storage Explorer lets you connect to individual resources, such as an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container, using various authentication methods. Some authentication methods are only supported for certain resource types.

| Resource type    | Azure AD | Account Name and Key | Shared Access Signature (SAS)  | Public (anonymous) |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| Storage accounts | Yes      | Yes                  | Yes (connection string or URL) | No                 |
| Blob containers  | Yes      | No                   | Yes (URL)                      | Yes                |
| Gen2 containers  | Yes      | No                   | Yes (URL)                      | Yes                |
| Gen2 directories | Yes      | No                   | Yes (URL)                      | Yes                |
| File shares      | No       | No                   | Yes (URL)                      | No                 |
| Queues           | Yes      | No                   | Yes (URL)                      | No                 |
| Tables           | No       | No                   | Yes (URL)                      | No                 |
 
Storage Explorer can also connect to a [local storage emulator](#local-storage-emulator) using the emulator's configured ports.

To connect to an individual resource, select the **Connect** button in the left-hand toolbar. Then follow the instructions for the resource type you want to connect to.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Connect to Azure storage option" source="./vs-storage-explorer-connect-button.png":::

When a connection to a storage account is successfully added, a new tree node will appear under **Local & Attached** > **Storage Accounts**.

For other resource types, a new node is added under **Local & Attached** > **Storage Accounts** > **(Attached Containers)**. The node will appear under a group node matching its type. For example, a new connection to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container will appear under **Blob Containers**.

If Storage Explorer couldn't add your connection, or if you can't access your data after successfully adding the connection, see the [Azure Storage Explorer troubleshooting guide](./storage/common/storage-explorer-troubleshooting.md).

The following sections describe the different authentication methods you can use to connect to individual resources.

#### Azure AD

Storage Explorer can use your Azure account to connect to the following resource types:
* Blob containers
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 containers
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 directories
* Queues
 
Azure AD is the preferred option if you have data layer access to your resource but no management layer access.

1. Sign in to at least one Azure account using the [steps described above](#sign-in-to-azure).
1. In the **Select Resource** panel of the **Connect to Azure Storage** dialog, select **Blob container**, **ADLS Gen2 container**, or **Queue**.
1. Select **Sign in using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** and select **Next**.
1. Select an Azure account and tenant. The account and tenant must have access to the Storage resource you want to attach to. Select **Next**.
1. Enter a display name for your connection and the URL of the resource. Select **Next**.
1. Review your connection information in the **Summary** panel. If the connection information is correct, select **Connect**.

#### Account name and key

Storage Explorer can connect to a storage account using the storage account's name and key.

You can find your account keys in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Open your storage account page and select **Settings** > **Access keys**.

1. In the **Select Resource** panel of the **Connect to Azure Storage** dialog, select **Storage account**.
1. Select **Account name and key** and select **Next**.
1. Enter a display name for your connection, the name of the account, and one of the account keys. Select the appropriate Azure environment. Select **Next**.
1. Review your connection information in the **Summary** panel. If the connection information is correct, select **Connect**.

#### Shared access signature (SAS) connection string

Storage Explorer can connect to a storage account using a connection string with a Shared Access Signature (SAS). A SAS connection string looks like this:

```text
SharedAccessSignature=sv=2020-04-08&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2021-03-02T00%3A22%3A19Z&se=2020-03-03T00%3A22%3A19Z&sp=rl&sig=fFFpX%2F5tzqmmFFaL0wRffHlhfFFLn6zJuylT6yhOo%2FY%3F;
BlobEndpoint=https://contoso.blob.core.windows.net/;
FileEndpoint=https://contoso.file.core.windows.net/;
QueueEndpoint=https://contoso.queue.core.windows.net/;
TableEndpoint=https://contoso.table.core.windows.net/;
```

1. In the **Select Resource** panel of the **Connect to Azure Storage** dialog, select **Storage account**.
1. Select **Shared access signature (SAS)** and select **Next**.
1. Enter a display name for your connection and the SAS connection string for the storage account. Select **Next**.
1. Review your connection information in the **Summary** panel. If the connection information is correct, select **Connect**.

#### Shared access signature (SAS) URL

Storage Explorer can connect to the following resource types using a SAS URI:
* Blob container
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container or directory
* File share
* Queue
* Table

A SAS URI looks like this:

```text
https://contoso.blob.core.windows.net/container01?sv=2020-04-08&st=2021-03-02T00%3A30%3A33Z&se=2020-03-03T00%3A30%3A33Z&sr=c&sp=rl&sig=z9VFdWffrV6FXU51T8b8HVfipZPOpYOFLXuQw6wfkFY%3F
```

1. In the **Select Resource** panel of the **Connect to Azure Storage** dialog, select the resource you want to connect to.
1. Select **Shared access signature (SAS)** and select **Next**.
1. Enter a display name for your connection and the SAS URI for the resource. Select **Next**.
1. Review your connection information in the **Summary** panel. If the connection information is correct, select **Connect**.

#### Local storage emulator

Storage Explorer can connect to an Azure Storage emulator. Currently, there are two supported emulators:

* [Azure Storage Emulator](storage/common/storage-use-emulator.md) (Windows only)
* [Azurite](https://github.com/azure/azurite) (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

If your emulator is listening on the default ports, you can use the **Local & Attached** > **Storage Accounts** > **Emulator - Default Ports** node to access your emulator.

If you want to use a different name for your connection, or if your emulator isn't running on the default ports:

1. Start your emulator.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Storage Explorer doesn't automatically start your emulator. You must start it manually.

1. In the **Select Resource** panel of the **Connect to Azure Storage** dialog, select **Local storage emulator**.
1. Enter a display name for your connection and the port number for each emulated service you want to use. If you don't want to use to a service, leave the corresponding port blank. Select **Next**.
1. Review your connection information in the **Summary** panel. If the connection information is correct, select **Connect**.

### Connect to Azure Cosmos DB

Storage Explorer also supports connecting to Azure Cosmos DB resources.

#### Connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account by using a connection string

Instead of managing Azure Cosmos DB accounts through an Azure subscription, you can connect to Azure Cosmos DB by using a connection string. To connect, follow these steps:

1. Under **EXPLORER**, expand **Local & Attached**, right-click **Cosmos DB Accounts**, and select **Connect to Azure Cosmos DB**.

    ![Connect to Azure Cosmos DB by connection string][21]

1. Select the Azure Cosmos DB API, enter your **Connection String** data, and then select **OK** to connect the Azure Cosmos DB account. For information about how to retrieve the connection string, see [Manage an Azure Cosmos account](./cosmos-db/how-to-manage-database-account.md).

    ![Connection string][22]

#### Connect to Azure Data Lake Store by URI

You can access a resource that's not in your subscription. You need someone who has access to that resource to give you the resource URI. After you sign in, connect to Data Lake Store by using the URI. To connect, follow these steps:

1. Under **EXPLORER**, expand **Local & Attached**.

1. Right-click **Data Lake Storage Gen1**, and select **Connect to Data Lake Storage Gen1**.

    ![Connect to Data Lake Store context menu](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer/storage-explorer-connect-data-lake-storage.png)

1. Enter the URI, and then select **OK**. Your Data Lake Store appears under **Data Lake Storage**.

    ![Connect to Data Lake Store result](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer/storage-explorer-attach-data-lake-finished.png)

This example uses Data Lake Storage Gen1. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is now available. For more information, see [What is Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](./data-lake-store/data-lake-store-overview.md).

## Generate a shared access signature in Storage Explorer<a name="generate-a-sas-in-storage-explorer"></a>

### Account level shared access signature

1. Right-click the storage account you want share, and then select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

    ![Get shared access signature context menu option][14]

1. In **Shared Access Signature**, specify the time frame and permissions you want for the account, and then select **Create**.

    ![Get a shared access signature][15]

1. Copy either the **Connection string** or the raw **Query string** to your clipboard.

### Service level shared access signature

You can get a shared access signature at the service level. For more information, see [Get the SAS for a blob container](vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs.md#get-the-sas-for-a-blob-container).

## Search for storage accounts

To find a storage resource, you can search in the **EXPLORER** pane.

As you enter text in the search box, Storage Explorer displays all resources that match the search value you've entered up to that point. This example shows a search for **endpoints**:

![Storage account search][23]

> [!NOTE]
> To speed up your search, use **Account Management** to deselect any subscriptions that don't contain the item you're searching for. You can also right-click a node and select **Search From Here** to start searching from a specific node.
