# Peering Service Preview connection

A connection typically refers to a logical information set, identifying a Peering Service. It is defined by specifying the following attributes:

- Logical Name
- Connectivity partner
- Customer's physical location
- IP prefixes

Customer can establish a single connection or multiple connections as per the requirement. A connection is also used as a unit of telemetry collection. For instance, to opt for telemetry alerts, customer must define the connection that will be monitored.

> [!Note]
> When you sign up for Peering Service, we analyze your Windows and Office 365 telemetry in order to provide you with latency measurements for your selected prefixes.
>For more information about connection telemetry, refer to the [Peering Service connection telemetry](connection-telemetry.md).
>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Peering Service" is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## How to register a connection?

**Scenario** - Let's say a branch office is spread across different geographic locations as shown in the figure below. Here, the customer is required to provide a logical name, Service Provider(SP) name, customer's physical location, and IP prefixes that are (owned by the customer or allocated by the Service Provider) associated with a single connection. This process must be repeated to register Peering Service for separate Geo-redundant connections.

> [!Note]
> For a preview, State level-filtration is considered for the customer's physical location when the connection is geo-located in the United States.
