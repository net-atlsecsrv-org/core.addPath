## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group.
 
From the left menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** and then select **myResourceGroup**.

On the resource group page, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.

Select **Delete**, type **myResourceGroup** in the text box, and then select **Delete**.
