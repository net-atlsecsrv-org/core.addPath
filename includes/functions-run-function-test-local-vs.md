1. To run your function, press F5 in Visual Studio. You might need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests. Authorization levels are never enforced when you run a function locally.

2. Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.

    ![Azure local runtime](./media/functions-run-function-test-local-vs/functions-debug-local-vs.png)

3. Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar. Append the query string `?name=<YOUR_NAME>` to this URL and run the request. The following image shows the response in the browser to the local GET request returned by the function:

4. To stop debugging, press Shift+F5 in Visual Studio.
