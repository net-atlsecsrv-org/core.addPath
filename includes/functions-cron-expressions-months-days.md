To specify months or days you can use numeric values, names, or abbreviations of names:

* For days, the numeric values are 0 to 6 where 0 starts with Sunday.
* Names are in English. For example: `Monday`, `January`.
* Names are case-insensitive.
* Names can be abbreviated. Three letters is the recommended abbreviation length.  For example: `Mon`, `Jan`.
