Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based shell experience to manage and develop Azure resources.

Cloud Shell offers a browser-accessible, pre-configured shell experience for managing Azure resources without the overhead of installing, versioning, and maintaining a machine yourself.

Cloud Shell provisions machines on a per-request basis and as a result machine state will not persist across sessions. 
Since Cloud Shell is built for interactive sessions, shells automatically terminate after 20 minutes of shell inactivity.
