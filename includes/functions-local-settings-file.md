## Local settings file

The local.settings.json file stores app settings, connection strings, and settings used by local development tools. Settings in the local.settings.json file are used only when you're running projects locally. The local settings file has this structure:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "<language worker>",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<connection-string>",
    "AzureWebJobsDashboard": "<connection-string>",
    "MyBindingConnection": "<binding-connection-string>",
    "AzureWebJobs.HttpExample.Disabled": "true"
  },
  "Host": {
    "LocalHttpPort": 7071,
    "CORS": "*",
    "CORSCredentials": false
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SQLConnectionString": "<sqlclient-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

These settings are supported when you run projects locally:

| Setting      | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`IsEncrypted`** | When this setting is set to `true`, all values are encrypted with a local machine key. Used with `func settings` commands. Default value is `false`. You might want to encrypt the local.settings.json file on your local computer when it contains secrets, such as service connection strings. The host automatically decrypts settings when it runs. Use the `func settings decrypt` command before trying to read locally encrypted settings. |
| **`Values`** | Array of application settings and connection strings used when a project is running locally. These key-value (string-string) pairs correspond to application settings in your function app in Azure, like [`AzureWebJobsStorage`]. Many triggers and bindings have a property that refers to a connection string app setting, like `Connection` for the [Blob storage trigger](../articles/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger.md#configuration). For these properties, you need an application setting defined in the `Values` array. See the subsequent table for a list of commonly used settings. <br/>Values must be strings and not JSON objects or arrays. Setting names can't include a colon (`:`) or a double underline (`__`). Double underline characters are reserved by the runtime, and the colon is reserved to support [dependency injection](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-dependency-injection.md#working-with-options-and-settings). |
| **`Host`** | Settings in this section customize the Functions host process when you run projects locally. These settings are separate from the host.json settings, which also apply when you run projects in Azure. |
| **`LocalHttpPort`** | Sets the default port used when running the local Functions host (`func host start` and `func run`). The `--port` command-line option takes precedence over this setting. |
| **`CORS`** | Defines the origins allowed for [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). Origins are supplied as a comma-separated list with no spaces. The wildcard value (\*) is supported, which allows requests from any origin. |
| **`CORSCredentials`** |  When set to `true`, allows `withCredentials` requests. |
| **`ConnectionStrings`** | A collection. Don't use this collection for the connection strings used by your function bindings. This collection is used only by frameworks that typically get connection strings from the `ConnectionStrings` section of a configuration file, like [Entity Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa937723(v=vs.113).aspx). Connection strings in this object are added to the environment with the provider type of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.sqlclient(v=vs.110).aspx). Items in this collection aren't published to Azure with other app settings. You must explicitly add these values to the `Connection strings` collection of your function app settings. If you're creating a [`SqlConnection`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection(v=vs.110).aspx) in your function code, you should store the connection string value with your other connections in **Application Settings** in the portal. |

The following application settings can be included in the **`Values`** array when running locally:

| Setting | Values | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
|**`AzureWebJobsStorage`**| Storage account connection string, or<br/>`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`| Contains the connection string for an Azure storage account. Required when using triggers other than HTTP. For more information, see the [`AzureWebJobsStorage`] reference.<br/>When you have the [Azure storage emulator](../articles/storage/common/storage-use-emulator.md) installed locally and you set [`AzureWebJobsStorage`] to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`, Core Tools uses the emulator. The emulator is useful during development, but you should test with an actual storage connection before deployment.| 
|**`AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled`**| `true`\|`false` | To disable a function when running locally, add `"AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled": "true"` to the collection, where `<FUNCTION_NAME>` is the name of the function. To learn more, see [How to disable functions in Azure Functions](../articles/azure-functions/disable-function.md#localsettingsjson) |
|**`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`** | `dotnet`<br/>`node`<br/>`java`<br/>`powershell`<br/>`python`| Indicates the targeted language of the Functions runtime. Required for version 2.x and higher of the Functions runtime. This setting is generated for your project by Core Tools. To learn more, see the [`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`](../articles/azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_runtime) reference.|
| **`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME_VERSION`** | `~7` |Indicates that PowerShell 7 be used when running locally. If not set, then PowerShell Core 6 is used. This setting is only used when running locally. When running in Azure, the PowerShell runtime version is determined by the `powerShellVersion` site configuration setting, which can be [set in the portal](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference-powershell.md#changing-the-powershell-version). |
