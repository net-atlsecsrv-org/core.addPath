There are **14** recommendations in this category.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|Access to storage accounts with firewall and virtual network configurations should be restricted |Review the settings of network access in your storage account firewall settings. It is recommended to configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premise clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges.<br />(Related policy: [Storage accounts should restrict network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f34c877ad-507e-4c82-993e-3452a6e0ad3c)) |Low |
|Adaptive network hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines |Azure Security Center has analyzed the internet traffic communication patterns of the virtual machines listed below, and determined that the existing rules in the NSGs associated to them are overly permissive, resulting in an increased potential attack surface.<br>This typically occurs when this IP address doesn't communicate regularly with this resource. Alternatively, the IP address has been flagged as malicious by Security Center's threat intelligence sources. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-adaptive-network-hardening">learn more</a><br />(Related policy: [Adaptive network hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f08e6af2d-db70-460a-bfe9-d5bd474ba9d6)) |High |
|All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine |Azure Security Center has identified some of your network security groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to target your resources.<br />(Related policy: [All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6)) |High |
|Azure DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled |Security Center has discovered virtual networks with Application Gateway resources unprotected by the DDoS protection service. These resources contain public IPs. Enable mitigation of network volumetric and protocol attacks.<br />(Related policy: [Azure DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fa7aca53f-2ed4-4466-a25e-0b45ade68efd)) |Medium |
|Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups |Protect your VM from potential threats by restricting access to it with a network security group (NSG). NSGs contain a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your VM from other instances, in or outside the same subnet.<br>Please note that to keep your machine as secured as possible, both the VM access to the Internet must be restricted, and an NSG should be enabled on the subnet.<br>VMs with 'High' severity are Internet-facing VMs.<br />(Related policy: [Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2ff6de0be7-9a8a-4b8a-b349-43cf02d22f7c)) |High |
|IP forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled |Azure Security Center has discovered that IP forwarding is enabled on some of your virtual machines. Enabling IP forwarding on a virtual machine's NIC allows the machine to receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team.<br />(Related policy: [IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fbd352bd5-2853-4985-bf0d-73806b4a5744)) |Medium |
|Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control |Azure Security Center has identified some overly-permissive inbound rules for management ports in your Network Security Group. Enable just-in-time access control to protect your VM from internet-based brute-force attacks. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time">Learn more.</a><br />(Related policy: [Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fb0f33259-77d7-4c9e-aac6-3aabcfae693c)) |High |
|Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines |Open remote management ports are exposing your VM to a high level of risk from Internet-based attacks. These attacks attempt to brute force credentials to gain admin access to the machine.<br />(Related policy: [Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f22730e10-96f6-4aac-ad84-9383d35b5917)) |Medium |
|Network traffic data collection agent should be installed on Linux virtual machines |Security Center uses the Microsoft Dependency agent to collect network traffic data from your Azure virtual machines to enable advanced network protection features such as traffic visualization on the network map, network hardening recommendations and specific network threats.<br />(Related policy: [Network traffic data collection agent should be installed on Linux virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f04c4380f-3fae-46e8-96c9-30193528f602)) |Medium |
|Network traffic data collection agent should be installed on Windows virtual machines |Security Center uses the Microsoft Dependency agent to collect network traffic data from your Azure virtual machines to enable advanced network protection features such as traffic visualization on the network map, network hardening recommendations and specific network threats.<br />(Related policy: [Network traffic data collection agent should be installed on Windows virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f2f2ee1de-44aa-4762-b6bd-0893fc3f306d)) |Medium |
|Non-internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups |Protect your non-internet-facing virtual machine from potential threats by restricting access to it with a network security group (NSG). NSGs contain a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your VM from other instances, whether or not they're on the same subnet.<br>Note that to keep your machine as secure as possible, the VM's access to the internet must be restricted and an NSG should be enabled on the subnet.<br />(Related policy: [Non-internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fbb91dfba-c30d-4263-9add-9c2384e659a6)) |Low |
|Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled |Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.<br />(Related policy: [Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f404c3081-a854-4457-ae30-26a93ef643f9)) |High |
|Subnets should be associated with a network security group |Protect your subnet from potential threats by restricting access to it with a network security group (NSG). NSGs contain a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all the VM instances and integrated services in that subnet, but don't apply to internal traffic inside the subnet. To secure resources in the same subnet from one another, enable NSG directly on the resources as well.<br />(Related policy: [Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fe71308d3-144b-4262-b144-efdc3cc90517)) |Low |
|Virtual networks should be protected by Azure Firewall |Some of your virtual networks aren't protected with a firewall. Use Azure Firewall to restricting access to your virtual networks and prevent potential threats. <a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-firewall>Learn more about Azure Firewall.</a><br />(Related policy: [All Internet traffic should be routed via your deployed Azure Firewall](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2ffc5e4038-4584-4632-8c85-c0448d374b2c)) |Low |
