> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains content that requires the Azure classic CLI. The current release
> of the Azure CLI doesn't have support for the features outlined in this article,
> so the classic CLI is required. 
> 
> The classic CLI can be installed side by side with the modern Azure CLI,
> but we recommend the Azure CLI for all new scripts and deployments.
> To install the classic CLI, see [Install the Azure classic CLI](/cli/azure/install-classic-cli). 
> To install the latest version of the CLI, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
