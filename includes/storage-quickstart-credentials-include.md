### Copy your credentials from the Azure portal

When the sample application makes a request to Azure Storage, it must be authorized. To authorize a request, add your storage account credentials to the application as a connection string. View your storage account credentials by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Locate your storage account.
3. In the **Settings** section of the storage account overview, select **Access keys**. Here, you can view your account access keys and the complete connection string for each key.
4. Find the **Connection string** value under **key1**, and select the **Copy** button to copy the connection string. You will add the connection string value to an environment variable in the next step.

### Configure your storage connection string

After you have copied your connection string, write it to a new environment variable on the local machine running the application. To set the environment variable, open a console window, and follow the instructions for your operating system. Replace `<yourconnectionstring>` with your actual connection string.

#### Windows

```cmd
setx CONNECT_STR "<yourconnectionstring>"
```

After you add the environment variable in Windows, you must start a new instance of the command window.

#### Linux

```bash
export CONNECT_STR="<yourconnectionstring>"
```

#### macOS

```bash
export CONNECT_STR="<yourconnectionstring>"
```

#### Restart programs

After you add the environment variable, restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variable. For example, restart your development environment or editor before continuing.
