If you are new to Cognitive Services or new to Azure, create a [temporary key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/). If you have an Azure account, create a new resource in the portal. Language Understanding endpoint queries support two Azure Resource types: **Language Understanding** or the **Cognitive Service** resource. You need the name of the resource when you [assign](../articles/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription.md) the key to the app.
