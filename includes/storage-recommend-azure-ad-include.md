> [!TIP]
> Azure Storage supports authorizing access to Blob and Queue storage resources using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Authorizing users or applications using an OAuth 2.0 token returned by Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over Shared Key authorization and shared access signatures (SAS). With Azure AD, there is no need to store the account access key with your code and risk potential security vulnerabilities.
>
> Microsoft recommends using Azure AD with your Azure Storage applications when possible. For more information, see [Authorize access to Azure blobs and queues using Azure Active Directory](../articles/storage/common/storage-auth-aad.md).
