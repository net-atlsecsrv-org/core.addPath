## Open Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment hosted in Azure and used through your browser. Azure Cloud Shell allows you to
use either `bash` or `PowerShell` shells to run a variety of tools to work with Azure services. Azure Cloud Shell comes pre-installed with the commands
to allow you to run the content of this article without having to install anything on your local environment.

To run any code contained in this article on Azure Cloud Shell, open a Cloud Shell session, use the **Copy** button on a code block to copy the code,
and paste it into the Cloud Shell session with __Ctrl+Shift+V__ on Windows and Linux, or __Cmd+Shift+V__ on macOS. Pasted text is not automatically
executed, so press **Enter** to run code.
