[Azure virtual machine scale sets](../articles/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) is an Azure feature that lets you configure a group of identical, load balanced VMs. There's no additional cost to scale sets and they're built from virtual machines. You pay only for the underlying compute resources such as the VM instances, load balancers, or Managed Disk storage. With scale sets, the management and automation layers are provided to run and scale your applications. You could instead manually create and manage individual VMs. However, there are two key benefits to using scale sets. They're built into Azure and they automatically scale your virtual machines to meet application needs.
