## Getting started

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/diskencryptionupdates).

    > [!IMPORTANT]

    :::image type="content" source="media/virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-portal/double-encryption-add-disk-encryption-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the disk encryption set blade, + Add is highlighted.":::

1. Select one of the supported regions.
1. For **Encryption type**, select **Double encryption with platform-managed and customer-managed keys**.
