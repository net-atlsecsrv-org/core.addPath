> 
> 1. Disable AzureRM aliases in `Az` (if enabled) with `Disable-AzAlias`. Running this command without
>    `Az` installed or with aliases disabled is harmless.
> 2. Follow the [latest install instructions for AzureRM](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). Even if you
>    have `AzureRM` installed, update to the latest version.
