> Using this Azure feature from PowerShell requires the `AzureRM` module installed. This
> is an older module only available for Windows PowerShell 5.1 that no longer receives new features.
> The `Az` and `AzureRM` modules are __not__ compatible when installed for the same versions of PowerShell.
> If you need both versions:
>
> 1. [Uninstall the Az module](/powershell/azure/uninstall-az-ps) from a PowerShell 5.1 session.
> 2. [Install the AzureRM module](/powershell/azure/azurerm/install-azurerm-ps) from a PowerShell 5.1 session.
> 3. [Download and install PowerShell Core 6.x or later](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows).
> 4. [Install the Az module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) in a PowerShell Core session.
