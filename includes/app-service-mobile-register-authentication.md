First, you need to register your app at an identity provider's site, and then you will set the provider-generated credentials in the Mobile Apps back end.

1. Configure your preferred identity provider by following the provider-specific instructions:

   * [Azure Active Directory](../articles/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad.md)
   * [Facebook](../articles/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-facebook.md)
   * [Google](../articles/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-google.md)
   * [Microsoft](../articles/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-microsoft.md)
   * [Twitter](../articles/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-twitter.md)
2. Repeat the previous steps for each provider you want to support in your app.
