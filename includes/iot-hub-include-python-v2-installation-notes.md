* [Python version 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is recommended. Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variable. For other versions of Python supported, see [Azure IoT Device Features](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/master/azure-iot-device#azure-iot-device-features) in the SDK documentation. If you choose to use Python 2.7, you may need to [install or upgrade *pip*, the Python package management system](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
