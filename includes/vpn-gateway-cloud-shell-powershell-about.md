This article uses PowerShell cmdlets. To run the cmdlets, you can use Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment hosted in Azure and used
through the browser. Azure Cloud Shell comes with the Azure PowerShell cmdlets pre-installed.

To run any code contained in this article on Azure Cloud Shell, open a Cloud Shell session, use the **Copy** button on a code block to copy the code,
and paste it into the Cloud Shell session with __Ctrl+Shift+V__ on Windows and Linux, or __Cmd+Shift+V__ on macOS. Pasted text is not automatically
executed, so press **Enter** to run code.

You can launch Azure Cloud Shell with:

|  |   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---|
| Select **Try It** in the upper-right corner of a code block. This __doesn't__ automatically copy text to Cloud Shell. | ![Example of Try It for Azure Cloud Shell](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/cli-try-it.png) |
| Open [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com) in your browser. | [![Launch Azure Cloud Shell button](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/launchcloudshell.png)](https://shell.azure.com) |
| Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu in the upper-right corner of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). | ![Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/cloud-shell-menu.png) |

**Running PowerShell locally**

You can also install and run the Azure PowerShell cmdlets locally on your computer. PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. If you are not running the latest version, the values specified in the instructions may fail. To find the versions of Azure PowerShell installed on your computer, use the `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` cmdlet. To install or update, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
