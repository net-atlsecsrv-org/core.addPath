A hub contains the gateway. Once the hub is created, you'll be charged for the hub, even if you don't attach any sites. It takes 30 minutes to create the hub and gateway.

1. Locate the Virtual WAN that you created. On the Virtual WAN page, under the **Virtual WAN architecture** section, click **Hubs**.
2. On the Hubs page, click **+New Hub** to open the **Create virtual hub** page.
3. On the **Create virtual hub** page, complete the following fields:

   * Location
   * Name
   * Hub private address space

Click **Confirm** to create the hub. Click **Refresh** to view the hub on the **Hubs** page.
