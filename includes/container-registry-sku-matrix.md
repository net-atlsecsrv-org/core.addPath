| SKU | Description |
|---|---|
| Basic | A cost-optimized entry point for developers learning about Azure Container Registry. Basic registries have the same programmatic capabilities as Standard and Premium (Azure Active Directory authentication integration, image deletion, and web hooks), however, there are size and usage constraints. |
| Standard | The Standard registry offers the same capabilities as Basic, but with increased storage limits and image throughput. Standard registries should satisfy the needs of most production scenarios. |
| Premium | Premium registries have higher limits on constraints, such as storage and concurrent operations, including enhanced storage capabilities to support high-volume scenarios. In addition to higher image throughput capacity, Premium adds features like geo-replication for managing a single registry across multiple regions, maintaining a network-close registry to each deployment. |
