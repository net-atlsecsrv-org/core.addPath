Fluentd is an open-source data collector for unified logging. The `Fluentd` settings manage the container's connection to a [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org) server. The container includes a Fluentd logging provider, which allows your container to write logs and, optionally, metric data to a Fluentd server.

The following table describes the configuration settings supported under the `Fluentd` section.

| Name | Data type | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `Host` | String | The IP address or DNS host name of the Fluentd server. |
| `Port` | Integer | The port of the Fluentd server.<br/> The default value is 24224. |
| `HeartbeatMs` | Integer | The heartbeat interval, in milliseconds. If no event traffic has been sent before this interval expires, a heartbeat is sent to the Fluentd server. The default value is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute). |
| `SendBufferSize` | Integer | The network buffer space, in bytes, allocated for send operations. The default value is 32768 bytes (32 kilobytes). |
| `TlsConnectionEstablishmentTimeoutMs` | Integer | The timeout, in milliseconds, to establish a SSL/TLS connection with the Fluentd server. The default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).<br/> If `UseTLS` is set to false, this value is ignored. |
| `UseTLS` | Boolean | Indicates whether the container should use SSL/TLS for communicating with the Fluentd server. The default value is false. |
