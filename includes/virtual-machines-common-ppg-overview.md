Placing VMs in a single region reduces the physical distance between the instances. Placing them within a single availability zone will also bring them physically closer together. However, as the Azure footprint grows, a single availability zone may span multiple physical data centers, which may result in a network latency impacting your application. 

To get VMs as close as possible, achieving the lowest possible latency, you should deploy them within a proximity placement group.

A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.


- Low latency between stand-alone VMs.
- Low Latency between VMs in a single availability set or a virtual machine scale set. 
- Low latency between stand-alone VMs, VMs in multiple Availability Sets, or multiple scale sets. You can have multiple compute resources in a single placement group to bring together a multi-tiered application. 
- Low latency between multiple application tiers using different hardware types. For example, running the backend using M-series in an availability set and the front end on a D-series instance, in a scale set, in a single proximity placement group.

## Best practices 
- For the lowest latency, use proximity placement groups together with accelerated networking. For more information, see [Create a Linux virtual machine with Accelerated Networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) or [Create a Windows virtual machine with Accelerated Networking](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).
- Deploy all VM sizes in a single resource manager template. In order to avoid landing on hardware that doesn't support all the VM SKUs and sizes you require, include all of the application tiers in a single template so that they will all be deployed at the same time.
- If you are scripting your deployment using PowerShell, CLI or the SDK, you may get an allocation error `OverconstrainedAllocationRequest`. In this case, you should stop/deallocate all the existing VMs, and change the sequence in the deployment script to begin with the VM SKU/sizes that failed. 
- When reusing an existing placement group from which VMs were deleted, wait for the deletion to fully complete before adding VMs to it.
- If latency is your first priority, put VMs in a proximity placement group and the entire solution in an availability zone. But, if resiliency is your top priority, spread your instances across multiple availability zones (a single proximity placement group cannot span zones).
