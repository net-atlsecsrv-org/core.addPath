## Overview of SSH and keys

[SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/) is an encrypted connection protocol that provides secure sign-ins over unsecured connections. SSH is the default connection protocol for Linux VMs hosted in Azure. Although SSH provides an encrypted connection, using passwords with SSH connections still leaves the VM vulnerable to brute-force attacks. We recommend connecting to a VM over SSH using a public-private key pair, also known as *SSH keys*. 

- The *public key* is placed on your Linux VM.

- The *private key* remains on your local system. Protect this private key. Do not share it.

When you use an SSH client to connect to your Linux VM (which has the public key), the remote VM tests the client to make sure it has the correct private key. If the client has the private key, it's granted access to the VM. 

Depending on your organization's security policies, you can reuse a single public-private key pair to access multiple Azure VMs and services. You do not need a separate pair of keys for each VM or service you wish to access. 

Your public key can be shared with anyone, but only you (or your local security infrastructure) should have access to your private key.
