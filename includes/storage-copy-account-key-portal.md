## Copy your credentials from the Azure portal

The sample application needs to authorize access to your storage account. Provide your storage account credentials to the application in the form of a connection string. To view your storage account credentials:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Locate your storage account.
3. In the **Settings** section of the storage account overview, select **Access keys**. Your account access keys and connection string are displayed.
4. Note the name of your storage account, which you'll need for authorization.   
5. Find the **Key** value under **key1**, and select **Copy** to copy the account key.
