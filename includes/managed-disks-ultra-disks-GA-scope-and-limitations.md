For now, ultra disks have additional limitations, they are as follows:

- Are supported in the following regions, with a varying number of availability zones per region:
    - East US 2
    - East US
    - West US 2
    - SouthEast Asia
    - North Europe
    - West Europe
    - UK South 
- Can only be used with availability zones (availability sets and single VM deployments outside of zones will not have the ability to attach an ultra disk)
- Are only supported on the following VM series:
    - [ESv3](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-the-new-dv3-and-ev3-vm-sizes/)
    - [DSv3](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-the-new-dv3-and-ev3-vm-sizes/)
    - FSv2
    - [M](../articles/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage.md)
    - [Mv2](../articles/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage.md)
- Not every VM size is available in every supported region with ultra disks
- Are only available as data disks and only support 4k physical sector size. Due to the 4K native sector size of Ultra Disk, there are some applications that won't be compatible with ultra disks. One example would be Oracle Database, which requires release 12.2 or later in order to support ultra disks.  
- Can only be created as empty disks  
- Do not yet support disk snapshots, VM images, availability sets, and Azure disk encryption
- Do not yet support integration with Azure Backup or Azure Site Recovery
- The current maximum limit for IOPS on GA VMs is 80,000.
- If you would like to participate in a limited preview of a VM that can accomplish 160,000 IOPS with ultra disks, please email UltraDiskFeedback@microsoft .com
