## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 6 or later. To check your version, run `node --version` in your console app.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- You can run this quickstart on Linux or Windows. The shell commands use the standard Linux path separator `/`. If you use use Windows, replace these separators with the Windows path separator `\`.

## Run a simulated device
In this section, you configure your local environment, install the Azure IoT Node.js device SDK, and run a sample that creates a simulated temperature controller.

### Configure your environment

1. Open a console using Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Bash.

1. Set the following environment variables, using the appropriate commands for your console. The simulated device uses these values to connect to IoT Central. For `IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE`, `IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY`, and `IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID`, use the device connection values that you saved previously.

    **Windows CMD**

    ```console
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE=DPS
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE=<application ID scope>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY=<device primary key>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID=<your device ID>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For Windows CMD there are no quotation marks surrounding the variable values.

    **PowerShell**

    ```azurepowershell
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE='DPS'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE='<application ID scope>'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY='<device primary key>'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID='<your device ID>'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT='global.azure-devices-provisioning.net'
    ```

    **Bash (Linux or Windows)**

    ```bash
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE='DPS'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE='<application ID scope>'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY='<device primary key>'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID='<your device ID>'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT='global.azure-devices-provisioning.net' 
    ```

### Install the SDK and samples

1. Copy the Azure IoT Node.js device SDK to your local machine.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node
    ```

1. Navigate to the samples directory.
    ```console
    cd azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/pnp
    ```
1. Install the Azure IoT Node.js SDK and necessary dependencies:
    ```console
    npm install
    ```

### Run the code

1. In your console, run the following code sample from the SDK. The sample creates a simulated temperature controller with thermostat sensors.
    ```console
    node pnpTemperatureController.js
    ```

    After your simulated device connects to your IoT Central application, it connects to the device instance you created in the application and begins to send telemetry. The connection details and telemetry output are shown in your console: 
    
    ```output
    registration succeeded
    assigned hub=iotc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx.azure-devices.net
    deviceId=my-sdk-device
    payload=undefined
    Connecting using connection string: HostName=iotc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=my-sdk-device;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
