> [!NOTE]
> The new VPN gateway SKUs (VpnGw1, VpnGw2, and VpnGw3) are supported for the Resource Manager deployment model only. Classic virtual networks should continue to use the old (legacy) SKUs.
>  * For information about working with the legacy gateway SKUs (Basic, Standard, and HighPerformance), see [Working with VPN gateway SKUs (legacy SKUs)](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-skus-legacy.md).
>  * For ExpressRoute gateway SKUs, see [Virtual Network Gateways for ExpressRoute](../articles/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md).
