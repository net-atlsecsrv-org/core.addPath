It's possible that your organization requires additional actions from subscription Owners to successfully set up an app registration (and, consequently, to finish setting up a usable Azure Digital Twins instance). The steps required may vary depending on your organization's specific settings.

Here are some common potential activities that an Owner may need to perform. These and other operations can be performed from the [*Azure AD App registrations*](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) page in the Azure portal.
* Grant admin consent for the app registration. Your organization may have *Admin Consent Required* globally turned on in Azure AD for all app registrations within your subscription. If so, the Owner will need to select this button for your company on the app registration's *API permissions* page for the app registration to be valid:

  - If consent was granted successfully, the entry for Azure Digital Twins should show a *Status* value of _Granted for **(your company)**_

  - The Owner may prefer to repeat this process for every app registration that is created, or to do it once and establish a single shared app registration for all Azure Digital Twins instances in the subscription to use. In the second scenario, the Owner should share the *client ID* and *tenant ID* for the app registration with the developers who will need to use the app registration. (This is how it's done within Microsoft's own tenant).
* Activate public client access
* Set specific reply URLs for web and desktop access
* Allow for implicit OAuth2 authentication flows

For more information about app registration and its different options, see [*Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform*](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth-register-app-v2).

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go, have assigned permissions to manage it, and have set up permissions for a client app to access it.
