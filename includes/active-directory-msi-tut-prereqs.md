- If you're not familiar with the managed identities for Azure resources feature, see this [overview](../articles/active-directory/msi-overview.md). If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.
- To perform the required resource creation and role management, your account needs "Owner" permissions at the appropriate scope (your subscription or resource group). If you need assistance with role assignment, see [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](../articles/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
- [Sign in to Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
