This sample requires Azure PowerShell. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the version.
If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). 

Run the [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) cmdlet to connect to Azure.
