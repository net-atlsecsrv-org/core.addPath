## Enable the Event Grid resource provider

If you haven't previously used Event Grid in your Azure subscription, you might need to register the Event Grid resource provider. Run the following command to register the provider:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid
```

It might take a moment for the registration to finish. To check the status, run:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid --query "registrationState"
```

When `registrationState` is `Registered`, you're ready to continue.
