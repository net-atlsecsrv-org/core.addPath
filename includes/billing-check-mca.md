Check the agreement type to determine whether you have access to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
 
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to check for billing account access. Search for and select **Cost Management + Billing**.

2. If you have access to just one billing scope, select **Properties** from the menu. You have access to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement if the billing account type is **Microsoft Customer Agreement**.

3. If you have access to multiple billing scopes, check the type in the billing account column. You have access to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement if the billing account type for any of the scopes is **Microsoft Customer Agreement**.
