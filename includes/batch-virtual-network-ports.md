### General requirements

* The VNet must be in the same subscription and region as the Batch account you use to create your pool.

* The pool using the VNet can have a maximum of 4096 nodes.

* The subnet specified for the pool must have enough unassigned IP addresses to accommodate the number of VMs targeted for the pool; that is, the sum of the `targetDedicatedNodes` and `targetLowPriorityNodes` properties of the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough unassigned IP addresses, the pool partially allocates the compute nodes, and a resize error occurs.

* Your Azure Storage endpoint needs to be resolved by any custom DNS servers that serve your VNet. Specifically, URLs of the form `<account>.table.core.windows.net`, `<account>.queue.core.windows.net`, and `<account>.blob.core.windows.net` should be resolvable.

Additional VNet requirements differ, depending on whether the Batch pool is in the Virtual Machine configuration or the Cloud Services configuration. For new pool deployments into a VNet, the Virtual Machine configuration is recommended.

### Pools in the Virtual Machine configuration

**Supported VNets** - Azure Resource Manager-based VNets only

**Subnet ID** - When specifying the subnet using the Batch APIs, use the *resource identifier* of the subnet. The subnet identifier is of the form:

  ```
  /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}
  ```

**Permissions** - Check whether your security policies or locks on the VNet's subscription or resource group restrict a user's permissions to manage the VNet.

**Additional networking resources** - Batch automatically allocates additional networking resources in the resource group containing the VNet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>For each 50 dedicated nodes (or each 20 low-priority nodes), Batch allocates: one network security group (NSG), one public IP address, and one load balancer. These resources are limited by the subscription's [resource quotas](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md). For large pools, you might need to request a quota increase for one or more of these resources.

#### Network security groups: Batch default

The subnet must allow inbound communication from the Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes, and outbound communication to communicate with Azure Storage or other resources as needed by your workload. For pools in the Virtual Machine configuration, Batch adds NSGs at the network interfaces (NICs) level attached to compute nodes. These NSGs are configured with the following additional rules:

* Inbound TCP traffic on ports 29876 and 29877 from Batch service IP addresses that correspond to the `BatchNodeManagement` service tag.
* Inbound TCP traffic on port 22 (Linux nodes) or port 3389 (Windows nodes) to permit remote access. For certain types of multi-instance tasks on Linux (such as MPI), you will need to also allow SSH port 22 traffic for IPs in the subnet containing the Batch compute nodes. This may be blocked per subnet-level NSG rules (see below).
* Outbound traffic on any port to the virtual network. This may be amended per subnet-level NSG rules (see below).
* Outbound traffic on any port to the Internet. This may be amended per subnet-level NSG rules (see below).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Exercise caution if you modify or add inbound or outbound rules in Batch-configured NSGs. If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service sets the state of the compute nodes to **unusable**. Additionally, no resource locks should be applied to any resource created by Batch, otherwise this can result in preventing cleanup of resources as a result of user-initiated actions such as deleting a pool.

#### Network security groups: Specifying subnet-level rules

It is not required to specify NSGs at the virtual network subnet level because Batch configures its own NSGs (see above). If you have an NSG associated with the subnet where Batch compute nodes are deployed or would like to apply custom NSG rules to override the defaults applied, then you must configure this NSG with at least the inbound and outbound security rules as shown in the following tables.

Configure inbound traffic on port 3389 (Windows) or 22 (Linux) only if you need to permit remote access to the compute nodes from outside sources. You may need to enable port 22 rules on Linux if you require support for multi-instance tasks with certain MPI runtimes. Allowing traffic on these ports is not strictly required for the pool compute nodes to be usable.

**Inbound security rules**

| Source IP addresses | Source service tag | Source ports | Destination | Destination ports | Protocol | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N/A | `BatchNodeManagement` [Service tag](../articles/virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags) (if using regional variant, in the same region as your Batch account) | * | Any | 29876-29877 | TCP | Allow |
| User source IPs for remotely accessing compute nodes and/or compute node subnet for Linux multi-instance tasks, if required. | N/A | * | Any | 3389 (Windows), 22 (Linux) | TCP | Allow |

**Outbound security rules**

| Source | Source ports | Destination | Destination service tag | Destination ports | Protocol | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any | * | [Service tag](../articles/virtual-network/security-overview.md#service-tags) | `Storage` (if using regional variant, in the same region as your Batch account) | 443 | TCP | Allow |

### Pools in the Cloud Services configuration

**Supported VNets** - Classic VNets only

**Subnet ID** - When specifying the subnet using the Batch APIs, use the *resource identifier* of the subnet. The subnet identifier is of the form:

  ```
  /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/Microsoft.ClassicNetwork /virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}
  ```

**Permissions** - The `Microsoft Azure Batch` service principal must have the `Classic Virtual Machine Contributor` Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet.

#### Network security groups

The subnet must allow inbound communication from the Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes, and outbound communication to communicate with Azure Storage or other resources.

You do not need to specify an NSG, because Batch configures inbound communication only from Batch IP addresses to the pool nodes. However, If the specified subnet has associated NSGs and/or a firewall, configure the inbound and outbound security rules as shown in the following tables. If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service sets the state of the compute nodes to **unusable**.

Configure inbound traffic on port 3389 for Windows if you need to permit RDP access to the pool nodes. It is not required for the pool nodes to be usable.

**Inbound security rules**

| Source IP addresses | Source ports | Destination | Destination ports | Protocol | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Any <br /><br />Although this requires effectively "allow all", the Batch service applies an ACL rule at the level of each node that filters out all non-Batch service IP addresses. | * | Any | 10100, 20100, 30100 | TCP | Allow |
| Optional, to allow RDP access to compute nodes. | * | Any | 3389 | TCP | Allow |

**Outbound security rules**

| Source | Source ports | Destination | Destination ports | Protocol | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any | * | Any | 443  | Any | Allow |
