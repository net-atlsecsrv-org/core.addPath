You can [Try Azure Cosmos DB for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cosmosdb/) without an Azure subscription, free of charge and commitments. Or, you can use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) with a URI of `https://localhost:8081`. For the key to use with the emulator, see [Authenticating requests](../articles/cosmos-db/local-emulator.md#authenticating-requests).
