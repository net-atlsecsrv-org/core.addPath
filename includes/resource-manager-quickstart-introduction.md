[Resource Manager template](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. If you want to learn more about developing Resource Manager templates, see [Resource Manager documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/) and the [template reference](/azure/templates).
