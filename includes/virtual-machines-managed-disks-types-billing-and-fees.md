**Outbound data transfers**: [Outbound data transfers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/) (data going out of Azure data centers) incur billing for bandwidth usage.

**Transactions**: You're billed for the number of transactions that you perform on a standard managed disk. For standard SSDs, each I/O operation less than or equal to 256 KiB of throughput is considered a single I/O operation. I/O operations larger than 256 KiB of throughput are considered multiple I/Os of size 256 KiB. For Standard HDDs, each IO operation is considered as a single transaction, regardless of the I/O size.

For detailed information on pricing for Managed Disks, including transaction costs, see [Managed Disks Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks).

### Ultra SSD VM reservation fee

Azure VMs have the capability to indicate if they are compatible with ultra SSD. An ultra disk compatible VM allocates dedicated bandwidth capacity between the compute VM instance and the block storage scale unit to optimize the performance and reduce latency. Adding this capability on the VM results in a reservation charge that is only imposed if you enabled ultra disk capability on the VM without attaching an ultra disk to it. When an ultra disk is attached to the ultra disk compatible VM, this charge would not be applied. This charge is per vCPU provisioned on the VM.

Refer to the [Azure Disks pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/) for ultra disk Disks pricing details.
