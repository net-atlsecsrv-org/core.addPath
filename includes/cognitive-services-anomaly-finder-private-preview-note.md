> [!NOTE]
> The Anomaly Detector API (now in public preview) is replacing the Anomaly Finder lab. Existing Anomaly Finder labs will be removed on April 30th, 2019. We encourage you to migrate to the Anomaly Detector before this time. See the [Anomaly Detector API documentation](../articles/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/index.yml) for more information.
