A security attribute is a quality or feature of an Azure service. It contributes to the service's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to security vulnerabilities.

In each category, we show "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether an attribute is used. For some services, we show "N/A" for an attribute that is not applicable. We might also provide a note or a link to more information about an attribute.
