>[!NOTE]
> Always check the version of your image to ensure it has the feautures you require. If you have a previous version of the container image already pulled on your machine, you'll need to specify the version tag you want, or delete the existing image before pulling again with the `:latest` tag. For more on image versions and tags, see [release notes](../articles/event-grid/edge/release-notes.md).
