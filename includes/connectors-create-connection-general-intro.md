Before your logic app can access any service, you must create 
a *connection* between your logic app and that service. 
If you didn't previously create this connection, 
you're prompted for connection information when you 
add a trigger or action for that service to your logic app. 
The Logic Apps Designer provides an easy way for you to 
create this connection directly from your logic app.
