When you add a trigger or action that connects to a service or system for the first time, the Logic App Designer prompts you to create a *connection* by providing the necessary information, which varies based on the connection, for example:

* A name to use for the new connection
* The server or system name
* Your user or account credentials
* The authentication type to use
* The Azure subscription and name for the data gateway that you previously create when connecting to on-premises data sources
