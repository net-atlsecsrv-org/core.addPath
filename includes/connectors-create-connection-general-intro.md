When you add a trigger or action that connects to a service or system for the first time, the Logic App Designer prompts you to create a *connection* by providing the necessary information, which varies based on the connection, for example:

* The name that you want to use for the new connection

* The name for the system or server

* Your user or account credentials

* The authentication type to use
