## Create an image gallery 

An image gallery is the primary resource used for enabling image sharing. 

Allowed characters for Gallery name are uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, dots, and periods. The gallery name cannot contain dashes.   Gallery names must be unique within your subscription. 

Create an image gallery using [az sig create](/cli/azure/sig#az-sig-create). The following example creates a resource group named gallery named *myGalleryRG* in *East US*, and a gallery named *myGallery*.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myGalleryRG --location eastus
az sig create --resource-group myGalleryRG --gallery-name myGallery
```

## Share the gallery

You can share images across subscriptions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You can share images at the gallery, image definition or image version level. Any user that has read permissions to an image version, even across subscriptions, will be able to deploy a VM using the image version.

We recommend that you share with other users at the gallery level. To get the object ID of your gallery, use [az sig show](/cli/azure/sig#az-sig-show).

```azurecli-interactive
az sig show \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --query id
```

Use the object ID as a scope, along with an email address and [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) to give a user access to the shared image gallery. Replace `<email-address>` and `<gallery iD>` with your own information.

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create \
   --role "Reader" \
   --assignee <email address> \
   --scope <gallery ID>
```

For more information about how to share resources using RBAC, see [Manage access using RBAC and Azure CLI](../articles/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli.md).
