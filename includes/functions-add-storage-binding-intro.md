Azure Functions lets you connect Azure services and other resources to functions without having to write your own integration code. These *bindings*, which represent both input and output, are declared within the function definition. Data from bindings is provided to the function as parameters. A *trigger* is a special type of input binding. Although a function has only one trigger, it can have multiple input and output bindings. To learn more, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](../articles/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings.md).
