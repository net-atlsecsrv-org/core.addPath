You must satisfy the following requirements to complete this tutorial:

**Azure CLI**: You must have Azure CLI version 2.0.29 or later installed on your local computer. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

**Docker**: This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts like containers, container images, and basic `docker` commands. For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview][docker-get-started].

**Docker Engine**: To complete this tutorial, you need Docker Engine installed locally. Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS][docker-mac], [Windows][docker-windows], and [Linux][docker-linux].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the Azure Cloud shell does not include the Docker daemon, you *must* install both the Azure CLI and Docker Engine on your *local computer* to complete this tutorial. You cannot use the Azure Cloud Shell for this tutorial.
