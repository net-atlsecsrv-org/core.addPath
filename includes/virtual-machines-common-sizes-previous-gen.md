This section provides information on previous generations of virtual machine sizes. These sizes can still be used, but there are newer generations available. 

## F-series

F-series is based on the 2.4 GHz Intel XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processor, which can achieve clock speeds as high as 3.1 GHz with the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. This is the same CPU performance as the Dv2-series of VMs.  

F-series VMs are an excellent choice for workloads that demand faster CPUs but do not need as much memory or temporary storage per vCPU.  Workloads such as analytics, gaming servers, web servers, and batch processing will benefit from the value of the F-series.

ACU: 210 - 250

Premium Storage:  Not Supported

Premium Storage caching:  Not Supported

| Size         | vCPU | Memory: GiB | Temp storage (SSD) GiB | Max temp storage throughput: IOPS / Read MBps / Write MBps | Max data disks / throughput: IOPS | Max NICs / Expected network bandwidth (Mbps) |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Standard_F1  | 1         | 2           | 16             | 3000 / 46 / 23                                           | 4 / 4x500                         | 2 / 750                 |
| Standard_F2  | 2         | 4           | 32             | 6000 / 93 / 46                                           | 8 / 8x500                         | 2 / 1500                     |
| Standard_F4  | 4         | 8           | 64             | 12000 / 187 / 93                                         | 16 / 16x500                         | 4 / 3000                     |
| Standard_F8  | 8         | 16          | 128            | 24000 / 375 / 187                                        | 32 / 32x500                       | 8 / 6000                     |
| Standard_F16 | 16        | 32          | 256            | 48000 / 750 / 375                                        | 64 / 64x500                       | 8 / 12000           |

## Fs-series <sup>1</sup>

The Fs-series provides all the advantages of the F-series, in addition to Premium storage.

ACU: 210 - 250

Premium Storage:  Supported

Premium Storage caching:  Supported

| Size | vCPU | Memory: GiB | Temp storage (SSD) GiB | Max data disks | Max cached and temp storage throughput: IOPS / MBps (cache size in GiB) | Max uncached disk throughput: IOPS / MBps | Max NICs / Expected network bandwidth (Mbps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard_F1s |1 |2 |4 |4 |4000 / 32 (12) |3200 / 48 |2 / 750 |
| Standard_F2s |2 |4 |8 |8 |8000 / 64 (24) |6400 / 96 |2 / 1500 |
| Standard_F4s |4 |8 |16 |16 |16000 / 128 (48) |12800 / 192 |4 / 3000 |
| Standard_F8s |8 |16 |32 |32 |32000 / 256 (96) |25600 / 384 |8 / 6000 |
| Standard_F16s |16 |32 |64 |64 |64000 / 512 (192) |51200 / 768 |8 / 12000 |

MBps = 10^6 bytes per second, and GiB = 1024^3 bytes.

<sup>1</sup> The maximum disk throughput (IOPS or MBps) possible with a Fs series VM may be limited by the number, size, and striping of the attached disk(s).  For details, see [Designing for high performance](../articles/virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage-performance.md).  

## NVv2-series

**Newer size recommendation**: [NVv3-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu#nvv3-series--1)

The NVv2-series virtual machines are powered by [NVIDIA Tesla M60](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/188417-Tesla-M60-DS-A4-fnl-Web.pdf) GPUs and NVIDIA GRID technology with Intel Broadwell CPUs. These virtual machines are targeted for GPU accelerated graphics applications and virtual desktops where customers want to visualize their data, simulate results to view, work on CAD, or render and stream content. Additionally, these virtual machines can run single precision workloads such as encoding and rendering. NVv2 virtual machines support Premium Storage and come with twice the system memory (RAM) when compared with its predecessor NV-series.  

Each GPU in NVv2 instances comes with a GRID license. This license gives you the flexibility to use an NV instance as a virtual workstation for a single user, or 25 concurrent users can connect to the VM for a virtual application scenario.
