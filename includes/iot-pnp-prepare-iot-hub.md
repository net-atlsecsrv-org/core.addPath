## Prepare an IoT hub

You also need an Azure IoT hub in your Azure subscription to complete this quickstart. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. If you don't have an IoT hub, follow [these instructions to create one](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-cli.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During public preview, IoT Plug and Play features are only available on IoT hubs created in the **Central US**, **North Europe**, and **Japan East** regions.

If you're using the Azure CLI locally, first sign in to your Azure subscription using `az login`. If you're running these commands in the Azure Cloud Shell, you're signed in automatically.

If you're using the Azure CLI locally, the `az` version should be **2.0.73** or later; the Azure Cloud Shell uses the latest version. Use the `az --version` command to check the version installed on your machine.

Run the following command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your instance:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add --name azure-iot
```

Run the following command to create the device identity in your IoT hub. Replace the **YourIoTHubName** and **YourDeviceID** placeholders with your own _IoT Hub name_ and a _device ID_ of your choice.

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name <YourIoTHubName> --device-id <YourDeviceID>
```

Run the following command to get the _device connection string_ for the device you just registered (note for use later):

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name <YourIoTHubName> --device-id <YourDeviceID> --output table
```
