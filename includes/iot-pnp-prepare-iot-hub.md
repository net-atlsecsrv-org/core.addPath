## Prepare an IoT hub

You need an Azure IoT hub in your Azure subscription to complete the steps in this article. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

If you're using the Azure CLI locally, first sign in to your Azure subscription using `az login`. If you're running these commands in the Azure Cloud Shell, you're signed in automatically.

If you're using the Azure CLI locally, the `az` version should be **2.8.0** or later; the Azure Cloud Shell uses the latest version. Use the `az --version` command to check the version installed on your machine.

Run the following command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your instance:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add --name azure-iot
```

If you don't already have an IoT hub to use, run the following commands to create a resource group and a free-tier IoT hub in your subscription. Replace `<YourIoTHubName>` with a hub name of your choice:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name my-pnp-resourcegroup \
    --location centralus
az iot hub create --name <YourIoTHubName> \
    --resource-group my-pnp-resourcegroup --sku F1
```

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Plug and Play is currently available on IoT hubs created in the Central US, North Europe, and East Japan regions. IoT Plug and Play support is not included in basic-tier IoT hubs.

Run the following command to create the device identity in your IoT hub. Replace the `<YourIoTHubName>` and `<YourDeviceID>` placeholders with your own _IoT Hub name_ and a _device ID_ of your choice.

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name <YourIoTHubName> --device-id <YourDeviceID>
```
