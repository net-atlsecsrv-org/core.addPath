This tutorial walks you through building the solution from the Azure portal. If you are interested in creating this solution from a template, choose the appropriate template from [Microsoft Azure GitHub templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates). The [Create an availability group with SQL Server 2014 replica virtual machines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sqlvm-alwayson-cluster) template creates the same solution as this tutorial.
