## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, **create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)** before you begin.

Also before you start, **install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), version 16.5 or later** on your development machine. If you have an older version installed already, you can open the *Visual Studio Installer* app on your machine and follow the prompts to update your installation.

The tutorial is driven by a sample project written in C#. The sample is located here: [Azure Digital Twins samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/digital-twins-samples). **Get the sample project** on your machine by navigating to the sample link, and selecting the *Download ZIP* button underneath the title.

This will download a *.ZIP* folder to your machine as **Azure_Digital_Twins_samples.zip**. Unzip the folder and extract the files.
