* **If you'd like to continue using the Azure Digital Twins instance you set up in this article, but clear out some or all of its models, twins, and relationships**, you can use the [az dt](/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/dt) CLI commands in an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) window to delete the elements you'd like to remove.
