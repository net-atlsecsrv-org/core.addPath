To work with Azure Digital Twins in this article, you first need to **set up an Azure Digital Twins instance** and the required permissions for using it. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up from previous work, you can use that instance.

Otherwise, follow the instructions in [Set up an instance and authentication](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md). The instructions also contain steps to verify that you've completed each step successfully and are ready to move on to using your new instance.

After you set up your Azure Digital Twins instance, make a note of the following values that you'll need to connect to the instance later:
* the instance's **_host name_**. You can find this value in the Azure portal ([instructions](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values)).
* the **Azure subscription** that you used to create the instance (either its name or ID will work). You can see what subscription an Azure Digital Twins instance is in by viewing the same *Overview* page for your instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
