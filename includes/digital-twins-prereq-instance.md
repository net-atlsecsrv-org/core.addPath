To work with Azure Digital Twins in this article, you first need to *set up an Azure Digital Twins instance*. You also need the required permissions for using it. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up, you can use it instead.

Otherwise, follow the instructions in [Set up an instance and authentication](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md). The instructions contain information to help you verify that you've completed each step successfully.

After you set up your instance, make a note of the following values. You'll need these values to connect to the instance later:
* The instance's *host name*. You can [find the host name in the Azure portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values).
* The *Azure subscription* that you used to create the instance. Either its name or its ID will work. You can find the subscription on your instance's **Overview** page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
