In a Java project, the bindings are defined as binding annotations on the function method. The *function.json* file is then autogenerated based on these annotations.

Browse to the location of your function code under _src/main/java_, open the *Function.java* project file, and add the following parameter to the `run` method definition:

:::code language="java" source="~/functions-quickstart-java/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue/src/main/java/com/function/Function.java" range="20-21":::

The `msg` parameter is an [`OutputBinding<T>`](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding) type, which represents a collection of strings that are written as messages to an output binding when the function completes. In this case, the output is a storage queue named `outqueue`. The connection string for the Storage account is set by the `connection` method. Rather than the connection string itself, you pass the application setting that contains the Storage account connection string.

The `run` method definition should now look like the following example:  

:::code language="java" source="~/functions-quickstart-java/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue/src/main/java/com/function/Function.java" range="16-22":::
