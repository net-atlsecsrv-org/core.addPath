> Azure CLI support for managing HDInsight resources using Azure Service Manager (ASM) is **deprecated**, and was removed on January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new Azure CLI commands that work with Azure Resource Manager.
> 
> Follow the steps in [Install the Azure CLI](/azure/cli/install-azure-cli) to install the latest version of the Azure CLI. If you have scripts that need to be modified to use the new commands that work with Azure Resource Manager, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md) for more information.
