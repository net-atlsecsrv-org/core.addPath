You can verify that your connection succeeded by using the [az network vpn-connection show](/cli/azure/network/vpn-connection) command. In the example, '--name' refers to the name of the connection that you want to test. When the connection is in the process of being established, its connection status shows 'Connecting'. Once the connection is established, the status changes to 'Connected'.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vpn-connection show --name VNet1toSite2 --resource-group TestRG1
```
