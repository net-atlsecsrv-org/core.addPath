**Create & Share Anchor** lets you create an anchor and save it to your sharing service. In return, you will get back an identifier for it that you can use to retrieve it from the sharing service. After this, you can then run the second scenario, **Locate Shared Anchor**, from either your device or a different one. **Locate Shared Anchor** allows you
to locate previously shared anchors by entering the identifier mentioned earlier. After you pick your scenario, the app will guide you with further
instructions around what to do. For example, you'll be asked to move your device around to collect environment
information. Later on, you'll place an anchor in the world, wait for it to save, start a new session, and then locate it.
