This sample requires Azure PowerShell Az 1.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to see which versions are installed. 
If you need to install, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). 

Run [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) to sign in to Azure.
