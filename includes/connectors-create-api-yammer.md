### Prerequisites
* A [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) account 

Before you can use your Yammer account in a Logic app, you must authorize the Logic app to connect to your Yammer account. Fortunately, you can do this easily from within your Logic app on the Azure Portal. 

Here are the steps to authorize your Logic app to connect to your Yammer account:

1. To create a connection to Yammer, in the Logic app designer, select **Show Microsoft managed APIs** in the drop down list then enter *Yammer* in the search box. Select the trigger or action you'll like to use:

2. If you haven't created any connections to Yammer before, you'll get prompted to provide your Yammer credentials. These credentials will be used to authorize your Logic app to connect to, and access your Yammer account's data:

3. Provide your Yammer user name and password to authorize your Logic app:

4. Notice the connection has been created and you are now free to proceed with the other steps in your Logic app:
