To access Azure Storage, you'll need an Azure subscription. If you don't already have a subscription, then create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

All access to Azure Storage takes place through a storage account. For this quickstart, create a storage account using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. For help creating the account, see [Create a storage account](../articles/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md).
