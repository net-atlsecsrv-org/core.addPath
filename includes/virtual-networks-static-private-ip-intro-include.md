A virtual machine (VM) is automatically assigned a private IP address from a range that you specify, based on the subnet it is deployed in. The address is retained by a VM until the VM is deleted. Azure dynamically assigns the next available private IP address from the subnet you create a VM in. Assign a static IP address if you want a specific IP address from the subnet assigned to the VM.
