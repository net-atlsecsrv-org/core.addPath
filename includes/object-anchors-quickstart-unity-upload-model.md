### Upload your model

If you don't already have an Object Anchors model, follow the instructions in [Create a model](../articles/object-anchors/quickstarts/get-started-model-conversion.md) to create one. Then, return here.

With your HoloLens connected to the Windows Device Portal, follow these steps to upload a model for the app to use:

1. In the Windows Device Portal, go to **System > File explorer > LocalAppData**. There, you should see your application on the list of apps.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/object-anchors-quickstarts-unity/portal-localappdata.png" alt-text="file explorer":::

2. Open your application and click on the `LocalState` folder.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/object-anchors-quickstarts-unity/portal-localstate.png" alt-text="Open the LocalState folder":::

3. Upload the model file to the `LocalState` folder.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/object-anchors-quickstarts/portal-upload-model.png" alt-text="upload the model in the portal":::

    Launch the application from the HoloLens again. You can now detect objects matching the model.
