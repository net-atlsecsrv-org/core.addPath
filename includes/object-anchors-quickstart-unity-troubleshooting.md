## Troubleshooting

### Tips

If your object isn't being detected, you can try the following steps:

1. Double check that you're using the correct model for your object.
2. Visualize the search area and ensure it covers the target object.
3. Try reducing the `MinSurfaceCoverage`.
4. In the Windows Device Portal, click **Views -> 3D Views**, and verify if the scan is complete.
