|Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Azure Active Directory. Each of the [Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-msi) are subject to their own timeline. Make sure you review the [availability](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-msi) status of managed identities for your resource and [known issues](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/known-issues) before you begin.|
