Connect to the VM using the private IP that you passed during the VM creation.

Open an SSH session to connect with the IP address.

`ssh -l <username> <ip address>`

When prompted, provide the password that you used when creating the VM.

If you need to provide the SSH key, use this command.

`ssh -i c:/users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa Administrator@5.5.41.236`

Here is a sample output when connecting to VM:

```powershell
PS C:\07-30-2020\linux> ssh -l Administrator 10.126.68.186
Administrator@10.126.68.186's password:

If you used a public IP address during VM creation, you can use that IP to connect to the VM. To get the public IP: 

```powershell
$publicIp = Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name <Public IP> -ResourceGroupName <Resource group name>
```
The public IP in this case will be the same as the private IP that you passed during virtual network interface creation.
