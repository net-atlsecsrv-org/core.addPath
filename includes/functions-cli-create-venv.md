## <a name="create-venv"></a>Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`. Be sure to use Python 3.8, 3.7 or 3.6, which are supported by Azure Functions.

# [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
```

```powershell
.venv\scripts\activate
```

# [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
py -m venv .venv
```

```cmd
.venv\scripts\activate
```

---

You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment. (To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.)
