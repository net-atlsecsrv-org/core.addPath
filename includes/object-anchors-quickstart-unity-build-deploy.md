Next, you'll need to configure the **Remote Machine IP address** to deploy and debug the app.

Right-click the App project and select **Properties**. In the properties page, select **Configuration Properties -> Debugging**. Change the **Machine Name** value to your HoloLens device's IP address and click **Apply**.

Close the property page. Click **Remote Machine**. The app should start to build and deploy to your remote device. Make sure your device is active.
