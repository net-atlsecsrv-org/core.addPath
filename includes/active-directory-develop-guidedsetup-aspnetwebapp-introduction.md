# Add sign-in with Microsoft to an ASP.NET web app

This guide demonstrates how to implement sign-in with Microsoft using an ASP.NET MVC solution with a traditional web browser-based application using OpenID Connect.

At the end of this guide, your application will be able to accept sign-ins of personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that has integrated with Azure Active Directory.

## How the sample app generated by this guide works

![Shows how the sample app generated by this tutorials works](media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-aspnetwebapp-intro/aspnetbrowsergeneral.svg)

The sample application created by this guide is based on the scenario where a user uses the browser to access an ASP.NET web site requesting a user to authenticate via a sign-in button. In this scenario, most of the work to render the web page occurs on the server side.

## Libraries

This guide uses the following libraries:

|Library|Description|
|---|---|
|[Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect/)|Middleware that enables an application to use OpenIdConnect for authentication|
|[Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies)|Middleware that enables an application to maintain user session using cookies|
|[Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb)|Enables OWIN-based applications to run on IIS using the ASP.NET request pipeline|
