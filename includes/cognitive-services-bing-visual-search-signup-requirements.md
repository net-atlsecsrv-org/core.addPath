## Create an Azure resource

Start using the Bing Visual Search API by creating one of the Azure resources below.

* [Create a trial resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api):
    * No Azure subscription needed.
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).

* [Create a Bing Search v7 resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingSearch-v7):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
    * Select the `S9` pricing tier.

* [Create a Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne):
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
    * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.
