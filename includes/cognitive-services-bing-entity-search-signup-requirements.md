## Create an Azure resource

Start using the Bing Entity Search API by creating one of the following Azure resources.

### [Bing Entity Search resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingEntitySearch)
   * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
   * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
   * Bing Entity Search is also offered in paid tiers of the [Bing Search v7 resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingSearch-v7).
    
### [Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne)
   * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
   * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.
