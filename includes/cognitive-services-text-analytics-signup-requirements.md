You must have a [Cognitive Services API subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with access to the Text Analytics API. If you don't have a subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) for free. Before continuing, you will need the Text Analytics subscription key provided after activating your account.
