> [!NOTE]
> Before you start this tutorial, complete the [Raspberry Pi online simulator](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started.md) tutorial or one of the device tutorials. For example, you can go to [Raspberry Pi with node.js](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started.md) or to one of the [Send telemetry](../articles/iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md) quickstarts. In these articles, you set up your Azure IoT device and IoT hub, and you deploy a sample application to run on your device. The application sends collected sensor data to your IoT hub.
