## Supported operating systems and drivers

### NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers

NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers for NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND, and NDv2-series VMs (optional for NV-series) are supported only on the operating systems listed in the following table. Driver download links are current at time of publication. For the latest drivers, visit the [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) website.

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative to manual CUDA driver installation on a Windows Server VM, you can deploy an Azure [Data Science Virtual Machine](../articles/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview.md) image. The DSVM editions for Windows Server 2016 pre-install NVIDIA CUDA drivers, the CUDA Deep Neural Network Library, and other tools.


| OS | Driver |
| -------- |------------- |
| Windows Server 2016 | [398.75](https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/Quadro_Certified/398.75/398.75-tesla-desktop-winserver2016-international.exe) (.exe) |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | [398.75](https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/Quadro_Certified/398.75/398.75-tesla-desktop-winserver2008-2012r2-64bit-international.exe) (.exe) |

### NVIDIA GRID drivers

Microsoft redistributes NVIDIA GRID driver installers for NV and NVv3-series VMs used as virtual workstations or for virtual applications. Install only these GRID drivers on Azure NV-series VMs, only on the operating systems listed in the following table. These drivers include licensing for GRID Virtual GPU Software in Azure. You do not need to set up a NVIDIA vGPU software license server.

The GRID drivers redistributed by Azure do not work on non-NV series VMs like NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND, and NDv2-series VMs.

Please note that the Nvidia extension will always install the latest driver. We provide links to the previous version here for customers, who have dependency on an older version.
