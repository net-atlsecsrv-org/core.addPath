Azure HPC optimized virtual machines (VMs) are designed to deliver leadership-class performance, MPI scalability, and cost efficiency for a variety of real-world applications.
 
## InfiniBand Networking for Large Scale HPC
HBv2 VMs feature 200 Gb/sec Mellanox HDR InfiniBand, while both HB and HC VMs feature 100 Gb/sec Mellanox EDR InfiniBand. Each of these VM types are connected in a non-blocking fat tree for optimized and consistent RDMA performance.

HBv2 VMs support Adaptive Routing and the Dynamic Connected Transport (DCT, in additional to standard RC and UD transports). These features enhance application performance, scalability, and consistency, and usage of them is strongly recommended.  

HBv2, HB, and HC VMs support standard Mellanox/OFED drivers. As such, all RDMA verbs and MPI types are supported. Each of these VM types  also support hardware-based offload of MPI collectives for increased application performance.
 
Original H-series VMs feature 56 Gb/sec Mellanox FDR InfiniBand. To leverage the InfiniBand interface on H-series, customers must deploy using officially supported images specific to this VM type from the Azure Marketplace. 


## HBv2-series
HBv2-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by memory bandwidth, such as fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and reservoir simulation. HBv2 VMs feature 120 AMD EPYC 7742 processor cores, 4 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no simultaneous multithreading. Each HBv2 VM provides up to 340 GB/sec of memory bandwidth, and up to 4 teraFLOPS of FP64 compute.

## HC-series
HC-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by dense computation, such as implicit finite element analysis, molecular dynamics, and computational chemistry. HC VMs feature 44 Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 processor cores, 8 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no hyperthreading. The Intel Xeon Platinum platform supports Intelâ€™s rich ecosystem of software tools such as Intel Math Kernel Library.
