To understand what a LUIS prediction endpoint returns, view a prediction result in a web browser. In order to query a public app, you need your own key and the app ID. The public IoT app ID, `df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2`, is provided as part of the URL in step one.

The format of the URL for a **GET** endpoint request is:

```JSON
https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/<appID>?subscription-key=<YOUR-KEY>&q=<user-utterance>
```

1. The endpoint of the public IoT app is in this format: `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2?subscription-key=<YOUR_KEY>&q=turn on the bedroom light`

    Copy the URL and substitute your key for the value of `<YOUR_KEY>`.

2. Paste the URL into a browser window and press Enter. The browser displays a JSON result that indicates that LUIS detects the `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` intent as the top intent and the `HomeAutomation.Room` entity with the value `bedroom`.

    ```JSON
    {
      "query": "turn on the bedroom light",
      "topScoringIntent": {
        "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOn",
        "score": 0.809439957
      },
      "entities": [
        {
          "entity": "bedroom",
          "type": "HomeAutomation.Room",
          "startIndex": 12,
          "endIndex": 18,
          "score": 0.8065475
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. Change the value of the `q=` parameter in the URL to `turn off the living room light`, and press Enter. The result now indicates that LUIS detected the `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` intent as the top intent and the `HomeAutomation.Room` entity with value `living room`. 

    ```JSON
    {
      "query": "turn off the living room light",
      "topScoringIntent": {
        "intent": "HomeAutomation.TurnOff",
        "score": 0.984057844
      },
      "entities": [
        {
          "entity": "living room",
          "type": "HomeAutomation.Room",
          "startIndex": 13,
          "endIndex": 23,
          "score": 0.9619945
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
