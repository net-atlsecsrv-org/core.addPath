## Set expiration

It's also possible to configure your anchor to expire automatically at a given date in the future. When an anchor expires, it will no longer be located or updated. Expiration can only be set when the anchor is created. Updating expiration afterwards isn't possible. So, you can set its expiration before saving it to the cloud.
