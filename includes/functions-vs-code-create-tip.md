> [!TIP]
> By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the function app name you provide. By default, they are also created in the same new resource group with the function app. If you want to either customize the names of these resources or reuse existing resources, you need to instead [publish the project with advanced create options](../articles/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs-code.md#enable-publishing-with-advanced-create-options).
