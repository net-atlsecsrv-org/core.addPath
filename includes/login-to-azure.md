## Sign in to Azure

You'll use the Azure CLI to create the resources needed to host your app in Azure. If you run Azure CLI commands in the Cloud Shell, you're already signed in. To run Azure CLI commands locally, sign in to your Azure subscription with the [az login](/cli/azure/) command and follow the on-screen directions.

```azurecli
az login
```
