## Verify IoT Edge CI/CD with the build and release pipelines

To trigger a build job, you can either push a commit to source code repository or manually trigger it. In this section, you manually trigger the CI/CD pipeline to test that it works. Then verify that the deployment succeeds.

1. From the left pane menu, select **Pipelines** and open the build pipeline that you created at the beginning of this article.

2. You can trigger a build job in your build pipeline by selecting the **Run pipeline** button in the top right.

3. Review the **Run pipeline** settings. Then, select **Run**.

4. Select **Agent job 1** to watch the run's progress. You can review the logs of the job's output by selecting the job.

5. If the build pipeline is completed successfully, it triggers a release to **dev** stage. The successful **dev** release creates IoT Edge deployment to target IoT Edge devices.
