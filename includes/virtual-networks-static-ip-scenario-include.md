## Scenario
To better illustrate how to configure a static IP address for a VM, this document will use the scenario below.

![VNet scenario](./media/virtual-networks-static-ip-scenario-include/static-ip-scenario.png)

In this scenario you will create a VM named **DNS01** in the **FrontEnd** subnet, and set it to use a static IP address of **192.168.1.101**.
