This article uses PowerShell cmdlets. To run the cmdlets, you can use Azure Cloud Shell. Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that has common Azure tools preinstalled and  is configured to use with your account. Just click the **Copy** to copy the code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and then press enter to run it. There are a few ways to launch the Cloud Shell:

**Run Azure PowerShell locally**

You can also install and run the Azure PowerShell cmdlets locally on your computer. PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. If you are not running the latest version, the values specified in the instructions may fail. To find the installed versions of PowerShell on your system, use the `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` cmdlet. To install or update, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
