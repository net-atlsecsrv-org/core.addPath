Azure Data Factory is a multitenant service that has the following default limits in place to make sure customer subscriptions are protected from each other's workloads. To raise the limits up to the maximum for your subscription, contact support.

<sup>3</sup> Pipeline, data set, and linked service objects represent a logical grouping of your workload. Limits for these objects don't relate to the amount of data you can move and process with Azure Data Factory. Data Factory is designed to scale to handle petabytes of data.

<sup>1</sup> Pipeline, data set, and linked service objects represent a logical grouping of your workload. Limits for these objects don't relate to the amount of data you can move and process with Azure Data Factory. Data Factory is designed to scale to handle petabytes of data.

<sup>2</sup> On-demand HDInsight cores are allocated out of the subscription that contains the data factory. As a result, the previous limit is the Data Factory-enforced core limit for on-demand HDInsight cores. It's different from the core limit that's associated with your Azure subscription.

<sup>3</sup> The cloud data movement unit (DMU) for version 1 is used in a cloud-to-cloud copy operation, learn more from [Cloud data movement units (version 1)](../articles/data-factory/v1/data-factory-copy-activity-performance.md#cloud-data-movement-units). For information on billing, see [Azure Data Factory pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-factory/).

| **Resource** | **Default lower limit** | **Minimum limit** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduling interval |15 minutes |15 minutes |
| Interval between retry attempts |1 second |1 second |
| Retry timeout value |1 second |1 second |

#### Web service call limits
Azure Resource Manager has limits for API calls. You can make API calls at a rate within the [Azure Resource Manager API limits](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#resource-group-limits).
