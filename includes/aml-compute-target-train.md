**Compute targets can be reused from one training job to the next**. For example, once you attach a remote VM to your workspace, you can reuse it for multiple jobs.  For machine learning pipelines, use the appropriate [pipeline step](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps?view=azure-ml-py) for each compute target.
