**Compute targets can be reused from one training job to the next.** For example, after you attach a remote VM to your workspace, you can reuse it for multiple jobs. For machine learning pipelines, use the appropriate [pipeline step](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps?preserve-view=true&view=azure-ml-py) for each compute target.

You can use any of the following resources for a training compute target for most jobs. Not all resources can be used for automated machine learning, machine learning pipelines, or designer.
