## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a deployed instance of the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator in your Azure subscription.

If you haven't deployed the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator yet, you should complete the [Deploy a cloud-based remote monitoring solution](../articles/iot-accelerators/quickstart-remote-monitoring-deploy.md) quickstart.

## Navigate to the dashboard

To view to the Remote Monitoring solution dashboard in your browser, first navigate to [Microsoft Azure IoT Solution Accelerators](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#dashboard). You may be asked to sign in using your Azure subscription credentials.

Then click **Launch** on the tile for the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator you deployed in the [Quickstart](../articles/iot-accelerators/quickstart-remote-monitoring-deploy.md).
