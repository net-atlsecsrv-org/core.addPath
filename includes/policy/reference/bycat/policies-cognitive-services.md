|[Cognitive Services accounts should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0725b4dd-7e76-479c-a735-68e7ee23d5ca) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services account isn't exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of Cognitive Services account. Learn more at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800).  |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should enable data encryption with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F67121cc7-ff39-4ab8-b7e3-95b84dab487d) |Customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data stored in Cognitive Services to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more about customer-managed keys at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121321](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121321). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should restrict network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F037eea7a-bd0a-46c5-9a66-03aea78705d3) |Network access to Cognitive Services accounts should be restricted. Configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the Cognitive Services account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premises clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should use a managed identity](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffe3fd216-4f83-4fc1-8984-2bbec80a3418) |Assigning a managed identity to your Cognitive Service account helps ensure secure authentication. This identity is used by this Cognitive service account to communicate with other Azure services, like Azure Key Vault, in a secure way without you having to manage any credentials. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_ManagedIdentity_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should use customer owned storage](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F46aa9b05-0e60-4eae-a88b-1e9d374fa515) |Use customer owned storage to control the data stored at rest in Cognitive Services. To learn more about customer owned storage, visit [https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_UserOwnedStorage_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcddd188c-4b82-4c48-a19d-ddf74ee66a01) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Cognitive Services, you'll reduce the potential for data leakage. Learn more about private links at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_EnablePrivateEndpoints_Audit.json) |

This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). |Disabled, Modify |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Cognitive Services accounts to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc4bc6f10-cb41-49eb-b000-d5ab82e2a091) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Cognitive Services accounts.
