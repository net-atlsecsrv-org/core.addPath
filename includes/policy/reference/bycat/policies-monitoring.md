Customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance and for more control over the access to your data in Azure Monitor. Linking your component to a Log Analytics workspace that's enabled with a customer-managed key, ensures that your Application Insights logs meet this compliance requirement, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys). |audit, deny, disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/ApplicationInsightsComponent_WorkspaceAssociation_Deny.json) |
