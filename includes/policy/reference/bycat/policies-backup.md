|[Azure Backup should be enabled for Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F013e242c-8828-4970-87b3-ab247555486d) |Ensure protection of your Azure Virtual Machines by enabling Azure Backup. Azure Backup is a secure and cost effective data protection solution for Azure. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/VirtualMachines_EnableAzureBackup_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Recovery Services vaults should use customer-managed keys for encrypting backup data](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2e94d99a-8a36-4563-bc77-810d8893b671) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your backup data. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but CMKs are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/AB-CmkEncryption](https://aka.ms/AB-CmkEncryption). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/AzBackupRSVault_CMKEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Recovery Services vaults should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdeeddb44-9f94-4903-9fa0-081d524406e3) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Recovery Services vaults, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/AB-PrivateEndpoints](https://aka.ms/AB-PrivateEndpoints). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/RecoveryServices_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Configure backup on virtual machines with a given tag to a new recovery services vault with a default policy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F83644c87-93dd-49fe-bf9f-6aff8fd0834e) |Enforce backup for all virtual machines by deploying a recovery services vault in the same location and resource group as the virtual machine. Doing this is useful when different application teams in your organization are allocated separate resource groups and need to manage their own backups and restores. You can optionally include virtual machines containing a specified tag to control the scope of assignment.

Doing this is useful when there is a central team in your organization managing backups for all resources in a subscription.
