An HSM provides a physical layer of protection for cryptographic keys. The cryptographic key cannot leave a physical HSM which provides a greater level of security than a software key. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/Keys_HSMBacked.json) |

Keys that are valid forever provide a potential attacker with more time to compromise the key. It is a recommended security practice to set expiration dates on cryptographic keys. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/Keys_ExpirationSet.json) |

Keys that are used for an extended period of time increase the probability that an attacker could compromise the key. As a good security practice, make sure that your keys have not been active longer than two years. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/Keys_ActivePeriod.json) |
