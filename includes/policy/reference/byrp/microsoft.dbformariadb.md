|[Geo-redundant backup should be enabled for Azure Database for MariaDB](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0ec47710-77ff-4a3d-9181-6aa50af424d0) |Azure Database for MariaDB allows you to choose the redundancy option for your database server. It can be set to a geo-redundant backup storage in which the data is not only stored within the region in which your server is hosted, but is also replicated to a paired region to provide recovery option in case of a region failure. Configuring geo-redundant storage for backup is only allowed during server create. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/GeoRedundant_DBForMariaDB_Audit.json) |
|[MariaDB server should use a virtual network service endpoint](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdfbd9a64-6114-48de-a47d-90574dc2e489) |Virtual network based firewall rules are used to enable traffic from a specific subnet to Azure Database for MariaDB while ensuring the traffic stays within the Azure boundary. This policy provides a way to audit if the Azure Database for MariaDB has virtual network service endpoint being used. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MariaDB_VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Private endpoint should be enabled for MariaDB servers](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0a1302fb-a631-4106-9753-f3d494733990) |Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for MariaDB. Configure a private endpoint connection to enable access to traffic coming only from known networks and prevent access from all other IP addresses, including within Azure. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MariaDB_EnablePrivateEndPoint_Audit.json) |
|[Public network access should be disabled for MariaDB servers](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffdccbe47-f3e3-4213-ad5d-ea459b2fa077) |Disabling the public network access property improves security by ensuring your Azure Database for MariaDB can only be accessed from a private endpoint. This configuration strictly disables access from any public address space outside of Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MariaDB_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
