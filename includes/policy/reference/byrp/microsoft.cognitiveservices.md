|[Cognitive Services accounts should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0725b4dd-7e76-479c-a735-68e7ee23d5ca) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services account isn't exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of Cognitive Services account.

|[Cognitive Services accounts should enable data encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2bdd0062-9d75-436e-89df-487dd8e4b3c7) |This policy audits any Cognitive Services account not using data encryption. For each Cognitive Services account with storage, should enable data encryption with either customer managed or Microsoft managed key. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_Encryption_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should enable data encryption with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F67121cc7-ff39-4ab8-b7e3-95b84dab487d) |Customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data stored in Cognitive Services to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more about customer-managed keys at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121321](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121321). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json) |

Configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the Cognitive Services account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premises clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |

This identity is used by this Cognitive service account to communicate with other Azure services, like Azure Key Vault, in a secure way without you having to manage any credentials. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_ManagedIdentity_Audit.json) |
