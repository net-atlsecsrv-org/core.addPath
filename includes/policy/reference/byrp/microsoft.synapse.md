|Name<br /><sub>(Azure portal)</sub> |Description |Effect(s) |Version<br /><sub>(GitHub)</sub> |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Auditing on Synapse workspace should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe04e5000-cd89-451d-bb21-a14d24ff9c73) |Auditing on your Synapse workspace should be enabled to track database activities across all databases on the dedicated SQL pools and save them in an audit log. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceSqlAuditing_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Synapse workspaces should allow outbound data traffic only to approved targets](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3484ce98-c0c5-4c83-994b-c5ac24785218) |Increase security of your Synapse workspace by allowing outbound data traffic only to approved targets. This helps prevention against data exfiltration by validating the target before sending data. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/Workspace_RestrictOutboundDataTraffic_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Synapse workspaces should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff7d52b2d-e161-4dfa-a82b-55e564167385) |Use customer-managed keys to control the encryption at rest of the data stored in Azure Synapse workspaces. Customer-managed keys deliver double encryption by adding a second layer of encryption on top of the default encryption with service-managed keys. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceCMK_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Synapse workspaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F72d11df1-dd8a-41f7-8925-b05b960ebafc) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Synapse workspace, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more about private links at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-connect-to-workspace-with-private-links](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-connect-to-workspace-with-private-links). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceUsePrivateLinks_Audit.json) |
|[Configure Azure Synapse workspaces with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3b3b0c27-08d2-4b32-879d-19930bee3266) |Private endpoints connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Synapse workspaces, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-connect-to-workspace-with-private-links](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-connect-to-workspace-with-private-links). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceUsePrivateLinks_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Synapse workspaces to have auditing enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fac7891a4-ac7a-4ba0-9ae9-c923e5a225ee) |To ensure the operations performed against your SQL assets are captured, Synapse workspaces should have auditing enabled. This is sometimes required for compliance with regulatory standards. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceSqlAuditing_Deploy.json) |
|[IP firewall rules on Azure Synapse workspaces should be removed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F56fd377d-098c-4f02-8406-81eb055902b8) |Removing all IP firewall rules improves security by ensuring your Azure Synapse workspace can only be accessed from a private endpoint. This configuration audits creation of firewall rules that allow public network access on the workspace. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceFirewallRules_Audit.json) |
|[Managed workspace virtual network on Azure Synapse workspaces should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2d9dbfa3-927b-4cf0-9d0f-08747f971650) |Enabling a managed workspace virtual network ensures that your workspace is network isolated from other workspaces. Data integration and Spark resources deployed in this virtual network also provides user level isolation for Spark activities. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceManagedVnet_Audit.json) |
|[Synapse managed private endpoints should only connect to resources in approved Azure Active Directory tenants](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3a003702-13d2-4679-941b-937e58c443f0) |Protect your Synapse workspace by only allowing connections to resources in approved Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. The approved Azure AD tenants can be defined during policy assignment. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/Workspace_DataExfiltrationPrevention_Deny.json) |
|[Synapse workspace auditing settings should have action groups configured to capture critical activities](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2b18f286-371e-4b80-9887-04759970c0d3) |To ensure your audit logs are as thorough as possible, the AuditActionsAndGroups property should include all the relevant groups. We recommend adding at least SUCCESSFUL_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP, FAILED_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP, and BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP. This is sometimes required for compliance with regulatory standards. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceSqlAuditing_ActionsAndGroups_Audit.json) |
|[Synapse workspaces with SQL auditing to storage account destination should be configured with 90 days retention or higher](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F529ea018-6afc-4ed4-95bd-7c9ee47b00bc) |For incident investigation purposes, we recommend setting the data retention for your Synapse workspace' SQL auditing to storage account destination to at least 90 days. Confirm that you are meeting the necessary retention rules for the regions in which you are operating. This is sometimes required for compliance with regulatory standards. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/SynapseWorkspaceSqlAuditingRetentionDays_Audit.json) |
|[Vulnerability assessment should be enabled on your Synapse workspaces](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0049a6b3-a662-4f3e-8635-39cf44ace45a) |Discover, track, and remediate potential vulnerabilities by configuring recurring SQL vulnerability assessment scans on your Synapse workspaces. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/ASC_SQLVulnerabilityAssessmentOnSynapse_Audit.json) |
