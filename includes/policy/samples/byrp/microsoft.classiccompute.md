|[\[Preview\] Vulnerability Assessment should be enabled on Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F501541f7-f7e7-4cd6-868c-4190fdad3ac9) |Monitors vulnerabilities detected by Azure Security Center Vulnerability Assessment on Virtual Machines |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0-preview |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_ServerVulnerabilityAssessment_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbd352bd5-2853-4985-bf0d-73806b4a5744) |Enabling IP forwarding on a virtual machine's NIC allows the machine to receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0-preview |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_IPForwardingOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
|[Access through Internet facing endpoint should be restricted](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security center has identified some of your Network Security Groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to easily target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |

These attacks attempt to brute force credentials to gain admin access to the machine. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_OpenManagementPortsOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
