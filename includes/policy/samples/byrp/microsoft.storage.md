|[Audit unrestricted network access to storage accounts](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F34c877ad-507e-4c82-993e-3452a6e0ad3c) |Audit unrestricted network access in your storage account firewall settings. Instead, configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premise clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.1.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |

|[Geo-redundant storage should be enabled for Storage Accounts](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbf045164-79ba-4215-8f95-f8048dc1780b) |This policy audits any Storage Account with geo-redundant storage not enabled. |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/GeoRedundant_StorageAccounts_Audit.json) |
|[Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F404c3081-a854-4457-ae30-26a93ef643f9) |Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.0.1 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_AuditForHTTPSEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Storage account containing the container with activity logs must be encrypted with BYOK](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffbb99e8e-e444-4da0-9ff1-75c92f5a85b2) |This policy audits if the Storage account containing the container with activity logs is encrypted with BYOK. The policy works only if the storage account lies on the same subscription as activity logs by design. More information on Azure Storage encryption at rest can be found here [https://aka.ms/azurestoragebyok](https://aka.ms/azurestoragebyok).  |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/ActivityLog_StorageAccountBYOK_Audit.json) |

To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.0.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccess_TrustedMicrosoftServices_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should be migrated to new Azure Resource Manager resources](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F37e0d2fe-28a5-43d6-a273-67d37d1f5606) |Use new Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security management |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.0.0 |[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Classic_AuditForClassicStorages_Audit.json) |
