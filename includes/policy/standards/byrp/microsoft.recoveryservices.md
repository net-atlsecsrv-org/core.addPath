## Azure Security Benchmark

The [Azure Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) provides recommendations on
how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. To see how this service completely maps to the
Azure Security Benchmark, see the

To review how the available Azure Policy built-ins for all Azure services map to this compliance
standard, see
