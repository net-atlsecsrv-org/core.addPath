## Azure Security Benchmark

The [Azure Security Benchmark](../../../../articles/security/benchmarks/overview.md) provides
recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. To see how this service
completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the
[Azure Security Benchmark mapping files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

To review how the available Azure Policy built-ins for all Azure services map to this compliance
standard, see
[Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance - Azure Security Benchmark](../../../../articles/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark.md).
