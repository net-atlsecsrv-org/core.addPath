The title of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **Policy Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more
> [Azure Policy](../../../articles/governance/policy/overview.md) definitions. These policies may
> help you [assess compliance](../../../articles/governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md)
> with the control; however, there often is not a one-to-one or complete match between a control and
> one or more policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies
> themselves; this doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In
> addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy
> definitions at this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your
> overall compliance status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy Regulatory
> Compliance definitions for these compliance standards may change over time.
