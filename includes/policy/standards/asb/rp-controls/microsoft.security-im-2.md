To manage subscriptions more securely, use of service principals with Resource Manager is recommended to limit the impact of a certificate compromise. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UseServicePrincipalToProtectSubscriptions.json) |
