|[Key vault should have purge protection enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0b60c0b2-2dc2-4e1c-b5c9-abbed971de53) |Malicious deletion of a key vault can lead to permanent data loss. A malicious insider in your organization may potentially be able to gain access to delete and purge key vaults. Purge protection protects you from insider attacks by enforcing a mandatory retention period for soft deleted key vaults. No one inside your organization or Microsoft will be able to purge your key vaults during the soft delete retention period. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/KeyVault_Recoverable_Audit.json) |
