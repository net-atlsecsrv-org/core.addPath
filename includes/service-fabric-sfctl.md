> There are two CLI utilities used to interact with Service Fabric. [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) is used to manage Azure resources, such as an Azure-hosted Service Fabric cluster. [Service Fabric CLI](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cli) is used to directly connect to the Service Fabric cluster (regardless of where it's hosted) and manage the cluster, applications, and services.
