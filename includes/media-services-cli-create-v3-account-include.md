## Create a Media Services account

You first need to create a Media Services account. This section shows what you need for the account creation using the Azure CLI.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the following command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which resources like Azure Media Services accounts and the associated Storage accounts are deployed and managed.

You can substitute `amsResourceGroup` with your value.

```azurecli
az group create --name amsResourceGroup --location westus2
```

### Create a storage account

When creating a Media Services account, you need to supply the name of an Azure Storage account resource. The specified storage account is attached to your Media Services account. For more information about how storage accounts are used in Media Services, see [Storage accounts](../articles/media-services/latest/storage-account-concept.md).

You must have one **Primary** storage account and you can have  any number of **Secondary** storage accounts associated with your Media Services account. Media Services supports **General-purpose v2** (GPv2) or **General-purpose v1** (GPv1) accounts. Blob only accounts are not allowed as **Primary**. If you want to learn more about storage accounts, see [Azure Storage account options](../articles/storage/common/storage-account-options.md). 

In this example, we create a General Purpose v2, Standard LRS account. If you want to experiment with storage accounts, use `--sku Standard_LRS`. However, when picking a SKU for production you should consider, `--sku Standard_RAGRS`, which provides geographic replication for business continuity. For more information, see [storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest).
 
The following command creates a Storage account that is going to be associated with the Media Services account. In the script below, you can substitute `storageaccountforams` with your value. `amsResourceGroup` must match the value you gave for the resource group in the previous step. The storage account name must have length less than 24.

```azurecli
az storage account create --name storageaccountforams \  
  --kind StorageV2 \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  -l westus2 \
  -g amsResourceGroup
```

### Create a Media Services account

The following Azure CLI command creates a new Media Services account. You can replace the following values: `amsaccount`  `storageaccountforams` (must match the value you gave for your storage account), and `amsResourceGroup` (must match the value you gave for the resource group).

```azurecli
az ams account create --name amsaccount \
   -g amsResourceGroup --storage-account storageaccountforams \
   -l westus2 
```
