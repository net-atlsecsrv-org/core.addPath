You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](../articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) with access to the Ink Recognizer API. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) for free. You can also view your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
