You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](../articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) with access to the Ink Recognizer API. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) for free. You can get your subscription key from the [Azure portal](../articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#get-the-keys-for-your-resource) after creating your account, or [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis) after activating a free trial.
