The emulator supports a single fixed account and a well-known authentication key for Shared Key authentication. This account and key are the only Shared Key credentials permitted for use with the emulator. They are:

```
Account name: devstoreaccount1
Account key: Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==
```

> [!NOTE]
> The authentication key supported by the emulator is intended only for testing the functionality of your client authentication code. It does not serve any security purpose. You cannot use your production storage account and key with the emulator. You should not use the development account with production data.
>
> The emulator supports connection via HTTP only. However, HTTPS is the recommended protocol for accessing resources in a production Azure storage account.

#### Connect to the emulator account using the shortcut

The easiest way to connect to the emulator from your application is to configure a connection string in your application's configuration file that references the shortcut `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`. The shortcut is equivalent to the full connection string for the emulator, which specifies the account name, the account key, and the emulator endpoints for each of the Azure Storage services:

```
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;
AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;
BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;
QueueEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10001/devstoreaccount1;
TableEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10002/devstoreaccount1;
```

The following .NET code snippet shows how you can use the shortcut from a method that takes a connection string. For example, the [BlobContainerClient(String, String)](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobcontainerclient.-ctor#Azure_Storage_Blobs_BlobContainerClient__ctor_System_String_System_String_) constructor takes a connection string.

```csharp
BlobContainerClient blobContainerClient = new BlobContainerClient("UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "sample-container");
blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
```

Make sure that the emulator is running before calling the code in the snippet.
