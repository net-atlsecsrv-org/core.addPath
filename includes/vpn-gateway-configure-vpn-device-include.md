**To download VPN device configuration scripts:**

Depending on the VPN device that you have, you may be able to download a VPN device configuration script. For more information, see [Download VPN device configuration scripts](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-download-vpndevicescript.md).

**See the following links for additional configuration information:**

- For information about compatible VPN devices, see [VPN Devices](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md).

- Before configuring your VPN device, check for any [Known device compatibility issues](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md#known) for the VPN device that you want to use.

- For links to device configuration settings, see [Validated VPN Devices](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md#devicetable). The device configuration links are provided on a best-effort basis. It's always best to check with your device manufacturer for the latest configuration information. The list shows the versions we have tested. If your OS is not on that list, it is still possible that the version is compatible. Check with your device manufacturer to verify that OS version for your VPN device is compatible.

- For an overview of VPN device configuration, see [Overview of 3rd party VPN device configurations](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-3rdparty-device-config-overview.md).

- For information about editing device configuration samples, see [Editing samples](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md#editing).

- For cryptographic requirements, see [About cryptographic requirements and Azure VPN gateways](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-compliance-crypto.md).

- For information about IPsec/IKE parameters, see [About VPN devices and IPsec/IKE parameters for Site-to-Site VPN gateway connections](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md#ipsec). This link shows information about IKE version, Diffie-Hellman Group, Authentication method, encryption and hashing algorithms, SA lifetime, PFS, and DPD, in addition to other parameter information that you need to complete your configuration.

- For IPsec/IKE policy configuration steps, see [Configure IPsec/IKE policy for S2S VPN or VNet-to-VNet connections](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell.md).

- To connect multiple policy-based VPN devices, see [Connect Azure VPN gateways to multiple on-premises policy-based VPN devices using PowerShell](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-connect-multiple-policybased-rm-ps.md).
