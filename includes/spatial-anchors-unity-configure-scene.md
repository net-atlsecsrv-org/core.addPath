The next step is to configure the app to use your account identifier and account key. You copied them into a text editor when [setting up the Spatial Anchors resource](#create-a-spatial-anchors-resource).

In the **Project** pane, navigate to `Assets\AzureSpatialAnchors.SDK\Resources`. Select `SpatialAnchorConfig`. Then, in the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Account Key` as the value for `Spatial Anchors Account Key` and the `Account ID` as the value for `Spatial Anchors Account Id`.
