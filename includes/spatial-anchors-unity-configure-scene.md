## Configure the account information

The next step is to configure the app to use your account information. You copied the **Account Key**, **Account ID**, and **Account Domain** values to a text editor earlier, in the ["Create a Spatial Anchors resource"](#create-a-spatial-anchors-resource) section.

On the **Project** pane, go to `Assets\AzureSpatialAnchors.SDK\Resources`. 

Select **SpatialAnchorConfig**. On the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Account Key` as the value for **Spatial Anchors Account Key**, the `Account ID` as the value for **Spatial Anchors Account Id**, and the `Account Domain` as the value for **Spatial Anchors Account Domain**.
