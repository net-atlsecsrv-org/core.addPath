## Configure the account information

In the **Project** pane, go to `Assets/AzureSpatialAnchors.Examples/Scenes` and open the `AzureSpatialAnchorsBasicDemo.unity` scene file.

The next step is to configure the app to use your account information. You copied them into a text editor when [setting up the Spatial Anchors resource](#create-a-spatial-anchors-resource).

In the **Project** pane, navigate to `Assets\AzureSpatialAnchors.SDK\Resources`. Select `SpatialAnchorConfig`. Then, in the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Account Key` as the value for `Spatial Anchors Account Key`, the `Account ID` as the value for `Spatial Anchors Account Id`, and the `Account Domain` as the value for `Spatial Anchors Account Domain`.

Save the scene by selecting **File** > **Save**.
