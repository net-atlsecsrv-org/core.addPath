If you are considering new deployments of StorSimple Virtual Array, we recommend that you explore other alternatives such as [Azure File Sync](../articles/storage/files/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide.md) or [Azure Data Box Online devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/) for your workloads.
