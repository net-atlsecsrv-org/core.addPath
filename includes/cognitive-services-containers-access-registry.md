## Use Docker CLI to authenticate private container registry

There are several ways to authenticate with the private container registry for Cognitive Services Containers, but the recommended method from the command line is by using the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

Use the [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) command, as shown in the following example, to log into `containerpreview.azurecr.io`, the private container registry for Cognitive Services Containers. Replace *\<username\>* with the user name and *\<password\>* with the password provided in the credentials you received from the Azure Cognitive Services team.

```
docker login containerpreview.azurecr.io -u <username> -p <password>
```

If you have secured your credentials in a text file, you can concatenate the contents of that text file, using the `cat` command, to the `docker login` command as shown in the following example. Replace *\<passwordFile\>* with the path and name of the text file containing the password and *\<username\>* with the user name provided in your credentials.

```
cat <passwordFile> | docker login containerpreview.azurecr.io -u <username> --password-stdin
```
