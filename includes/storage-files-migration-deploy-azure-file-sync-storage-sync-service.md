In this step, you need your Azure subscription credentials.

The core resource to configure for Azure File Sync is called a *Storage Sync Service*. We recommend that you deploy only one for all servers that are syncing the same set of files now or in the future. Create multiple Storage Sync Services only if you have distinct sets of servers that must never exchange data. For example, you might have servers that must never sync the same Azure file share. Otherwise, a single Storage Sync Service is the best practice.

Choose an Azure region for your Storage Sync Service that's close to your location. All other cloud resources must be deployed in the same region. To simplify management, create a new resource group in your subscription that houses sync and storage resources.

For more information, see the [section about deploying the Storage Sync Service](../articles/storage/files/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide.md#deploy-the-storage-sync-service) in the article about deploying Azure File Sync.
