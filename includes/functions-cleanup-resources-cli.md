## Clean up resources

If you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue output binding, keep all your resources in place as you'll build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

 # [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```
