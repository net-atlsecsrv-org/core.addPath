> [!TIP]
> You can use the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command to list your downloaded container images. For example, the following command lists the ID, repository, and tag of each downloaded container image, formatted as a table:
>
>  ```
>  docker images --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}"
>
>  IMAGE ID            REPOSITORY              TAG
>  ebbee78a6baa       <container-name>         latest
>  ```
