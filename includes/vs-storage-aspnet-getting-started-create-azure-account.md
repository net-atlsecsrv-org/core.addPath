## Create an Azure storage account
The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](../articles/storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

You can also create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.storage/), [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md), or the [Storage Resource Provider Client Library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage).
