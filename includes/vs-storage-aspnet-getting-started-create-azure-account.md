## Create an Azure storage account
The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account).

You can also create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](../articles/storage/common/storage-powershell-guide-full.md), [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/common/storage-azure-cli.md), or the [Storage Resource Provider Client Library for .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt131037.aspx).
