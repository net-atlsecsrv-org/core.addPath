# Call the Microsoft Graph API from a Windows Desktop app

This guide demonstrates how a native Windows Desktop .NET (XAML) application can get an access token and call the Microsoft Graph API or other APIs that require access tokens from an  Microsoft identity platform for developers (formerly named Azure AD) v2.0 endpoint.

When you've completed the guide, your application will be able to call a protected API that uses personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others). The application will also use work and school accounts from any company or organization that uses Azure Active Directory.  

> [!NOTE]
> The guide requires Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or Visual Studio 2017. Don’t have either of these versions? [Download Visual Studio 2017 for free](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

## How the sample app generated by this guide works

![Shows how the sample app generated by this tutorials works](./media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-windesktop-intro/windesktophowitworks.svg)

The sample application that you create with this guide enables a Windows Desktop application that queries the Microsoft Graph API or a Web API that accepts tokens from a Microsoft identity platform endpoint. For this scenario, you add a token to HTTP requests via the Authorization header. Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) handles token acquisition and renewal.

## Handling token acquisition for accessing protected Web APIs

After the user is authenticated, the sample application receives a token that can be used to query Microsoft Graph API or a Web API that's secured by Microsoft identity platform for developers.

APIs such as Microsoft Graph require a token to allow access to specific resources. For example, a token is required to read a user’s profile, access a user’s calendar, or send email. Your application can request an access token by using MSAL to access these resources by specifying API scopes. This access token is then added to the HTTP Authorization header for every call that's made against the protected resource.

MSAL manages caching and refreshing access tokens for you, so that your application doesn't need to.
