## Download the model

Later, you use Azure IoT explorer to view the device when it connects to your IoT hub. Azure IoT explorer needs a local copy of the model file that matches the **Model ID** your device sends. The model file lets Azure IoT explorer display the telemetry, properties, and commands that your device implements.

If you haven't already downloaded the sample model files:

1. Create a folder called *models* on your local machine.

1. Right-click [TemperatureController.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/master/DTDL/v2/samples/TemperatureController.json) and save the JSON file to the *models* folder.

1. Right-click [Thermostat.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/master/DTDL/v2/samples/Thermostat.json) and save the JSON file to the *models* folder.
