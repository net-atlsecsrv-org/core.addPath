>[!NOTE]
> If you need to guarantee pending events are persisted in the event of a device restart, you'll need to enable persistence for the event subscription. For more information on how to setup persistence, see the following articles: [Persist state in Linux](../articles/event-grid/edge/persist-state-linux.md) or [Persist state in Windows](../articles/event-grid/edge/persist-state-windows.md).
