## Use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to get a token for the Microsoft Graph API

Open `ViewController.swift` and replace the code with:

```swift
import UIKit
import MSAL

// A View Controller that will respond to the events of the Storyboard.
class ViewController: UIViewController, UITextFieldDelegate, URLSessionDelegate {

    // Replace Your_Application_Id_Here with the client ID you received in the portal. The below is for running the demo only.
    let kClientID = "Your_Application_Id_Here"

    // These settings you don't need to edit unless you wish to attempt deeper scenarios with the app.
    let kGraphURI = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/"
    let kScopes: [String] = ["https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read"]
    let kAuthority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"

    var accessToken = String()
    var applicationContext : MSALPublicClientApplication?

                                    identifier within the directory itself (e.g. a domain associated to the
                                    tenant, such as contoso.onmicrosoft.com, or the GUID representing the

### More Information

#### Getting a user token interactively

Calling the `acquireToken` method results in a browser window prompting the user to sign in. Applications usually require a user to sign in interactively the first time they need to access a protected resource, or when a silent operation to acquire a token fails (e.g. the user’s password expired).

#### Getting a user token silently

The `acquireTokenSilent` method handles token acquisitions and renewal without any user interaction. After `acquireToken` is executed for the first time, `acquireTokenSilent` is the method commonly used to obtain tokens used to access protected resources for subsequent calls - as calls to request or renew tokens are made silently.

Eventually, `acquireTokenSilent` will fail – e.g. the user has signed out, or has changed their password on another device. When MSAL detects that the issue can be resolved by requiring an interactive action, it fires an `MSALErrorCode.interactionRequired` exception. Your application can handle this exception in two ways:

1. Make a call against `acquireToken` immediately, which results in prompting the user to sign in. This pattern is usually used in online applications where there is no offline content in the application available for the user. The sample application generated by this guided setup uses this pattern: you can see it in action the first time you execute the application. Because no user ever used the application, `applicationContext.allAccounts().first` will contain a null value, and an `MSALErrorCode.interactionRequired` exception will be thrown. The code in the sample then handles the exception by calling `acquireToken` resulting in prompting the user to sign in.

2. Applications can also make a visual indication to the user that an interactive sign-in is required, so the user can select the right time to sign in, or the application can retry `acquireTokenSilent` at a later time. This is usually used when the user can use other functionality of the application without being disrupted - for example, there is offline content available in the application. In this case, the user can decide when they want to sign in to access the protected resource, or to refresh the outdated information, or your application can decide to retry `acquireTokenSilent` when network is restored after being unavailable temporarily.

## Call the Microsoft Graph API using the token you just obtained

Add the new method below to `ViewController.swift`. This method is used to make a `GET` request against the Microsoft Graph API using an *HTTP Authorization header*:

```swift
 func getContentWithToken() {

        // Specify the Graph API endpoint
        let url = URL(string: kGraphURI)
        var request = URLRequest(url: url!)
    
        // Set the Authorization header for the request. We use Bearer tokens, so we specify Bearer + the token we got from the result
        request.setValue("Bearer \(self.accessToken)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")

        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in

            if let error = error {
                self.updateLogging(text: "Couldn't get graph result: \(error)")
                return
            }

            guard let result = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data!, options: []) else {

                self.updateLogging(text: "Couldn't deserialize result JSON")
                return
            }

            self.updateLogging(text: "Result from Graph: \(result))")

        }.resume()
    }
```

### Making a REST call against a protected API

In this sample application, the `getContentWithToken()` method is used to make an HTTP `GET` request against a protected resource that requires a token and then return the content to the caller. This method adds the acquired token in the *HTTP Authorization header*. For this sample, the resource is the Microsoft Graph API *me* endpoint – which displays the user's profile information.

## Set up sign-out

Add the following method to `ViewController.swift` to sign out the user:

```swift 
 @IBAction func signoutButton(_ sender: UIButton) {

        guard let applicationContext = self.applicationContext else { return }

        guard let account = self.currentAccount() else { return }

        do {

            /**
             Removes all tokens from the cache for this application for the provided account
             - account:    The account to remove from the cache
             */

            try applicationContext.remove(account)
            self.loggingText.text = ""
            self.signoutButton.isEnabled = false

        } catch let error as NSError {

            self.updateLogging(text: "Received error signing account out: \(error)")
        }
    }

}
```

<!--start-collapse-->
### More info on sign-out

The `signoutButton` method removes the user from the MSAL user cache – this will effectively tell MSAL to forget the current user so a future request to acquire a token will only succeed if it is made to be interactive.

Although the application in this sample supports a single user, MSAL supports scenarios where multiple accounts can be signed in at the same time – an example is an email application where a user has multiple accounts.

## Register the callback

Once the user authenticates, the browser redirects the user back to the application. Follow the steps below to register this callback:

1. Open `AppDelegate.swift` and import MSAL:

```swift
import MSAL
```

<!-- Workaround for Docs conversion bug -->
<ol start="2">
<li>
Add the following method to your <code>AppDelegate</code> class to handle callbacks:
</li>
</ol>

```swift
// @brief Handles inbound URLs. Checks if the URL matches the redirect URI for a pending AppAuth
// authorization request and if so, will look for the code in the response.

func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {
    
    print("Received callback!")
    
    MSALPublicClientApplication.handleMSALResponse(url)
    
    return true
}
```
