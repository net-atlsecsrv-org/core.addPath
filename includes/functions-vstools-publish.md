1. Select **Create** to create a function app and its related resources in Azure. 
1. In the **Functions instance**, make sure that **Run from package file** is checked. Your function app is deployed using [Zip Deploy](../articles/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies.md#zip-deploy) with [Run-From-Package](../articles/azure-functions/run-functions-from-deployment-package.md) mode enabled. This is the recommended deployment method for your functions project, since it results in better performance.
