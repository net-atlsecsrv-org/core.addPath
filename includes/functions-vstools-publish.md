    When you enable **Run from Zip**, your function app in Azure goes into read-only mode and is run directly from the deployment package. For more information, see [Run your Azure Functions from a package file](../articles/azure-functions/run-functions-from-deployment-package.md).
     
    >[!CAUTION]
    >When you choose **Select Existing**, all files in the existing function app in Azure are overwritten by files from the local project. Only use this option when republishing updates to an existing function app.

3. If you haven't already connected Visual Studio to your Azure account, select **Add an account...**.

4. In the **Create App Service** dialog, use the **Hosting** settings as specified in the table below the image:

    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Description                                |
    | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | **App Name** | Globally unique name | Name that uniquely identifies your new function app. |
    | **Subscription** | Choose your subscription | The Azure subscription to use. |
    | **[Resource Group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md)** | myResourceGroup |  Name of the resource group in which to create your function app. Choose **New** to create a new resource group.|
    | **[App Service Plan](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md)** | Consumption plan | Make sure to choose the **Consumption** under **Size** after you click **New** to create a serverless plan. Also, choose a **Location** in a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) near you or near other services your functions access. When you run in a plan other than **Consumption**, you must manage the [scaling of your function app](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md).  |
    | **[Storage Account](../articles/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md)** | General purpose storage account | An Azure storage account is required by the Functions runtime. Click **New** to create a general purpose storage account. You can also use an existing account that meets the [storage account requirements](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md#storage-account-requirements).  |

5. Click **Create** to create a function app and related resources in Azure with these settings and deploy your function project code. 

6. After the deployment is complete, make a note of the **Site URL** value, which is the address of your function app in Azure.
