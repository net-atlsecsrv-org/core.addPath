## Attack scenario

Brute force attacks commonly target management ports as a means to gain access to a VM. If successful, an attacker can take control over the VM and establish a foothold into your environment.

One way to reduce exposure to a brute force attack is to limit the amount of time that a port is open. Management ports don't need to be open at all times. They only need to be open while you're connected to the VM, for example to perform management or maintenance tasks. When just-in-time is enabled, Security Center uses [network security group](../articles/virtual-network/security-overview.md#security-rules) (NSG) and Azure Firewall rules, which restrict access to management ports so they cannot be targeted by attackers.

## How does JIT access work?

When just-in-time is enabled, Security Center locks down inbound traffic to your Azure VMs by creating an NSG rule. You select the ports on the VM to which inbound traffic will be locked down. These ports are controlled by the just-in-time solution.

When a user requests access to a VM, Security Center checks that the user has [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](../articles/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md) permissions for that VM. If the request is approved, Security Center automatically configures the Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall to allow inbound traffic to the selected ports and requested source IP addresses or ranges, for the amount of time that was specified. After the time has expired, Security Center restores the NSGs to their previous states. Those connections that are already established are not being interrupted, however.

 > [!NOTE]
 > If a JIT access request is approved for a VM behind an Azure Firewall, then Security Center automatically changes both the NSG and firewall policy rules. For the amount of time that was specified, the rules allow inbound traffic to the selected ports and requested source IP addresses or ranges. After the time is over, Security Center restores the firewall and NSG rules to their previous states.


## Roles that can read JIT policies

**Reader** and **SecurityReader** roles can both read policies.

## Permissions needed to configure and use JIT

If you want to create custom roles that can work with JIT, you'll need the following details:

| To enable a user to: | Permissions to set|
| --- | --- |
| Configure or edit a JIT policy for a VM | *Assign these actions to the role:*  <ul><li>On the scope of a subscription or resource group that is associated with the VM:<br/> `Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/write` </li><li> On the scope of a subscription or resource group of VM: <br/>`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`</li></ul> | 
|Request JIT access to a VM | *Assign these actions to the user:*  <ul><li>On the scope of a subscription or resource group that is associated with the VM:<br/>  `Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/initiate/action` </li><li>On the scope of a subscription or resource group that is associated with the VM:<br/>  `Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/*/read` </li><li>  On the scope of a subscription or resource group or VM:<br/> `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read` </li><li>  On the scope of a subscription or resource group or VM:<br/> `Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/*/read` </li></ul>|
|Read JIT policies| *Assign these actions to the user:*  <ul><li>`Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/read`</li><li>`Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/initiate/action`</li><li>`Microsoft.Security/policies/read`</li><li>`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read`</li><li>`Microsoft.Network/*/read`</li>|
