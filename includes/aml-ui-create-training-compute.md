A pipeline runs on a compute target which is a compute resource that is attached to your workspace. Once you create a compute target, you can reuse it for future runs.

1. Select **Run** at the top of the canvas to run the pipeline.

1. When the **Settings** pane appears, select **Select compute target**.

    If you already have an available compute target, you can select it to run this pipeline.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The visual interface can only run experiments on Machine Learning Compute targets. Other compute targets will not be shown.

1. Provide a name for the compute resource.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Select **Run**.

1. In the **Set up pipeline run** dialog, select **+ New experiment** for the **Experiment**

    > [!NOTE]
    > Experiments group similar pipeline runs together. If you run a pipeline multiple times, you can select the same experiment for successive runs.

    * Enter a descriptive **Experiment Name**

    * Select **Run**
    
    You can view run status and details at the top right of the canvas.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It takes approximately 5 minutes to create a compute resource. After the resource is created, you can reuse it and skip this wait time for future runs.
    >
    > The compute resource will autoscale to 0 nodes when it is idle to save cost.  When you use it again after a delay, you may again experience approximately 5 minutes of wait time while it scales back up.
