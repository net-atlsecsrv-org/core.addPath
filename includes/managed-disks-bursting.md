On Azure, we offer the ability to boost disk storage IOPS and MB/s performance referred to as bursting on both Virtual Machines and disks. Busting is useful in many scenarios, such as handling unexpected disk traffic or processing batch jobs. You can effectively leverage VM and disk level bursting to achieve great baseline and bursting performance on both your VM and disk. This way you can achieve great baseline performance and bursting performance on both your vm and disk. 

Please note that bursting on Disks and VMs are independent from one another. If you have a bursting disk, you do not need a bursting VM to allow your disk to burst. If you have a bursting VM, you do no need a bursting disk to allow your VM to burst.
