> [!NOTE]
> Cloudyn is being deprecated by the end of 2020. Existing Cloudyn features are being integrated directly into the Azure portal wherever possible. With the exception of CSP customers, no new customers can onboard at this time. Support for the existing product will remain until it is fully deprecated. For information about determining whether Azure Cost Management or Cloudyn is best for your cost management needs, see [Choose between Azure Cost Management and Cloudyn](../articles/cost-management-billing/costs/choose-between-azure-cost-management-cloudyn.md).
