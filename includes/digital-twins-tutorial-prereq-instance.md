### Prepare an Azure Digital Twins instance

To complete this tutorial, you'll need an **Azure Digital Twins instance** to program against. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up from previous work, you can use that instance.

* Otherwise, **set up an instance and authentication** using the instructions in [*How-to: Set up an instance and authentication*](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md). The instructions also contain steps to verify that you have completed each step successfully and are ready to move on to using your new instance.

Once you have an Azure Digital Twins instance to work with in the tutorial, you'll need the instance's **_host name_** ([find in portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values)).
