### Prepare an Azure Digital Twins instance

To complete this tutorial, you'll need an **Azure Digital Twins instance** to program against. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up from previous work, you can use that instance, and skip to the next section.

Otherwise, **set up an instance and authentication** using the instructions in [*How-to: Set up an instance and authentication*](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-scripted.md). The instructions also contain steps to verify that you have completed each step successfully and are ready to move on to using your new instance.
