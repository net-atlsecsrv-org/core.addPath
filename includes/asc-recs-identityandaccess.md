|Firewall should be enabled on Key Vault |Key vault's firewall prevents unauthorized traffic from reaching your key vault and provides an additional layer of protection for your secrets. Enable the firewall to make sure that only traffic from allowed networks can access your key vault.<br />(Related policy: [Firewall should be enabled on Key Vault](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f55615ac9-af46-4a59-874e-391cc3dfb490)) |Medium |
|Key Vault keys should have an expiration date |Cryptographic keys should have a defined expiration date and not be permanent. Keys that are valid forever provide a potential attacker with more time to compromise the key. It is a recommended security practice to set expiration dates on cryptographic keys.<br />(Related policy: [Key Vault keys should have an expiration date](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f152b15f7-8e1f-4c1f-ab71-8c010ba5dbc0)) |High |

|Key vaults should have purge protection enabled |Malicious deletion of a key vault can lead to permanent data loss. A malicious insider in your organization can potentially delete and purge key vaults. Purge protection protects you from insider attacks by enforcing a mandatory retention period for soft deleted key vaults. No one inside your organization or Microsoft will be able to purge your key vaults during the soft delete retention period.<br />(Related policy: [Key vaults should have purge protection enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f0b60c0b2-2dc2-4e1c-b5c9-abbed971de53)) |Medium |
|Key vaults should have soft delete enabled |Deleting a key vault without soft delete enabled permanently deletes all secrets, keys, and certificates stored in the key vault. Accidental deletion of a key vault can lead to permanent data loss. Soft delete allows you to recover an accidentally deleted key vault for a configurable retention period.<br />(Related policy: [Key vaults should have soft delete enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f1e66c121-a66a-4b1f-9b83-0fd99bf0fc2d)) |High |

|Private endpoint should be configured for Key Vault |Private link provides a way to connect Key Vault to your Azure resources without sending traffic over the public internet. Private link provides defense in depth protection against data exfiltration.<br />(Related policy: [Private endpoint should be configured for Key Vault](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f5f0bc445-3935-4915-9981-011aa2b46147)) |Medium |
|Service principals should be used to protect your subscriptions instead of Management Certificates |Management certificates allow anyone who authenticates with them to manage the subscription(s) they are associated with. To manage subscriptions more securely, using service principals with Resource Manager is recommended to limit the blast radius in the case of a certificate compromise. It also automates resource management. <br />(Related policy: [Service principals should be used to protect your subscriptions instead of management certificates](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f6646a0bd-e110-40ca-bb97-84fcee63c414)) |Medium |
|Storage account public access should be disallowed |Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Storage is a convenient way to share data, but might present security risks. To prevent data breaches caused by undesired anonymous access, Microsoft recommends preventing public access to a storage account unless your scenario requires it.<br />(Related policy: [Storage account public access should be disallowed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fmicrosoft.authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f4fa4b6c0-31ca-4c0d-b10d-24b96f62a751)) |Medium |
|There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription |Designate more than one subscription owner in order to have administrator access redundancy.<br />(Related policy: [There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f09024ccc-0c5f-475e-9457-b7c0d9ed487b)) |High |
|Validity period of certificates stored in Azure Key Vault should not exceed 12 months |Ensure your certificates do not have a validity period that exceeds 12 months.<br />(Related policy: [Certificates should have the specified maximum validity period](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f0a075868-4c26-42ef-914c-5bc007359560)) |Medium |
