## Create an Azure resource

Start using the Bing Custom Search API by creating one of the following Azure resources.

### [Bing Custom Search resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingCustomSearch)
   * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
   * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

### [Multi-Service resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne)
   * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
   * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.
