## Create a service principal

To create a service principal with access to your container registry, run the following script in the [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/overview.md) or a local installation of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). The script is formatted for the Bash shell.

Before running the script, update the `ACR_NAME` variable with the name of your container registry. The `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME` value must be unique within your Azure Active Directory tenant. If you receive an "`'http://acr-service-principal' already exists.`" error, specify a different name for the service principal.

You can optionally modify the `--role` value in the [az ad sp create-for-rbac][az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac] command if you want to grant different permissions. For a complete list of roles, see [ACR roles and permissions](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/master/docs/roles-and-permissions.md).

After you run the script, take note of the service principal's **ID** and **password**. Once you have its credentials, you can configure your applications and services to authenticate to your container registry as the service principal.

## Use an existing service principal

To grant registry access to an existing service principal, you must assign a new role to the service principal. As with creating a new service principal, you can grant pull, push and pull, and owner access, among others.

The following script uses the [az role assignment create][az-role-assignment-create] command to grant *pull* permissions to a service principal you specify in the `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID` variable. Adjust the `--role` value if you'd like to grant a different level of access.
