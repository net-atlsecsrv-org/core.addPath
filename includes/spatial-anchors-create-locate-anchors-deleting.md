## Delete anchors

To delete a cloud spatial anchor, you use the `DeleteAnchor()` method. Deleting anchors when no longer used is a good practice to include early on in your development process and practices. Doing so keeps resources cleaned up. Moreover, even though you can use Azure Spatial Anchors free of charge, pricing may change in the future. You can find details about pricing during Preview on our [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/spatial-anchors/).
