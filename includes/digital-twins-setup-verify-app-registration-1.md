To check whether the permissions have been configured correctly, follow [this link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) to navigate to the Azure AD app registration overview page in the Azure portal. This page shows all the app registrations that have been created in your subscription.

You should see the app registration you just created in the overview list. Select it to open up its details.
