To check whether the permissions have been configured correctly, navigate to the [Azure AD app registration overview page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) in the Azure portal. You can get to this page yourself by searching for *App registrations* in the portal search bar.

Switch to the *All applications* tab to see all the app registrations that have been created in your subscription.

You should see the app registration you just created in the list. Select it to open up its details.
