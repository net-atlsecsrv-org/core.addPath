## Locate a cloud spatial anchor

Being able to locate a previously saved cloud spatial anchor is one of the main reasons for using Azure Spatial Anchors. There are several different ways you can locate a cloud spatial anchor. You can use one strategy on a watcher at a time.
- Locate anchors by identifier.
- Locate anchors connected to a previously located anchor. You can learn about anchor relationships [here](/azure/spatial-anchors/concepts/anchor-relationships-way-finding/).
- Locate anchor using [Coarse relocalization](/azure/spatial-anchors/concepts/coarse-reloc/).

If you are locating cloud spatial anchors by identifier, you will want to store the cloud spatial anchor identifier in your application's back-end service, and make it accessible to all devices that can properly authenticate to it. For an example of this, see [Tutorial: Share Spatial Anchors across devices](/azure/spatial-anchors/tutorials/tutorial-share-anchors-across-devices/).

Instantiate an `AnchorLocateCriteria` object, set the identifiers you're looking for, and invoke the `CreateWatcher` method on the session by providing your `AnchorLocateCriteria`.
