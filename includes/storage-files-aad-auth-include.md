[Azure Files](../articles/storage/files/storage-files-introduction.md) supports identity-based authentication over SMB (Server Message Block) (preview) through [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Domain Services](../articles/active-directory-domain-services/overview.md). Your domain-joined Windows virtual machines (VMs) can access Azure file shares using [Azure AD](../articles/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) credentials. 

Azure AD authenticates an identity such as a user, group, or service principal with [role-based access control (RBAC)](../articles/role-based-access-control/overview.md). You can define custom RBAC roles that encompass common sets of permissions used to access Azure Files. When you assign your custom RBAC role to an Azure AD identity, that identity is granted access to an Azure file share according to those permissions.

As part of the preview, Azure Files also supports preserving, inheriting, and enforcing [NTFS DACLs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/2006.01.howitworksntfs.aspx) on all files and directories in a file share. If you copy data from a file share to Azure Files, or vice versa, you can specify that NTFS DACLs are maintained. In this way you can implement backup scenarios using Azure Files, preserving your NTFS DACLS between your on-premises file share and your cloud file share. 

> [!NOTE]
> - Azure AD authentication over SMB is not supported for Linux VMs for the preview release. Only Windows Server VMs are supported.
> - Azure AD authentication over SMB is not supported for on-premises machines accessing Azure Files.
> - Azure AD authentication is available only for storage accounts created after September 24, 2018.
> - Azure AD authentication over SMB and NTFS ACL persistent is not supported on Azure file shares managed by Azure File Sync Service.
