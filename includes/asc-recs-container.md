|Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access |Azure container registries by default accept connections over the internet from hosts on any network. To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have an IP/firewall rule or a configured virtual network, it will appear in the unhealthy resources. Learn more about Container Registry network rules here: https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network and here https://aka.ms/acr/vnet.<br />(Related policy: [Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fd0793b48-0edc-4296-a390-4c75d1bdfd71)) |Medium |
|Container registries should use private link |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network.By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks. Learn more at: https://aka.ms/acr/private-link.<br />(Related policy: [Container registries should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fe8eef0a8-67cf-4eb4-9386-14b0e78733d4)) |Medium |
|Container with privilege escalation should be avoided |Containers shouldn't run with privilege escalation to root in your Kubernetes cluster.<br>The AllowPrivilegeEscalation attribute controls whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process.<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes clusters should not allow container privilege escalation](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f1c6e92c9-99f0-4e55-9cf2-0c234dc48f99)) |Medium |
|Containers sharing sensitive host namespaces should be avoided |To protect against privilege escalation outside the container, avoid pod access to sensitive host namespaces (host process ID and host IPC) in a Kubernetes cluster.<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster containers should not share host process ID or host IPC namespace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f47a1ee2f-2a2a-4576-bf2a-e0e36709c2b8)) |Medium |

|Least privileged Linux capabilities should be enforced for containers |To reduce attack surface of your container, restrict Linux capabilities and grant specific privileges to containers without granting all the privileges of the root user. We recommend dropping all capabilities, then adding those that are required<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed capabilities](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fc26596ff-4d70-4e6a-9a30-c2506bd2f80c)) |Medium |
|Overriding or disabling of containers AppArmor profile should be restricted |Containers running on your Kubernetes cluster should be limited to allowed AppArmor profiles only.<br>;AppArmor (Application Armor) is a Linux security module that protects an operating system and its applications from security threats. To use it, a system administrator associates an AppArmor security profile with each program.<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed AppArmor profiles](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f511f5417-5d12-434d-ab2e-816901e72a5e)) |High |
|Privileged containers should be avoided |To prevent unrestricted host access, avoid privileged containers whenever possible.<p>Privileged containers have all of the root capabilities of a host machine. They can be used as entry points for attacks and to spread malicious code or malware to compromised applications, hosts and networks.</p><br />(Related policy: [Do not allow privileged containers in Kubernetes cluster](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f95edb821-ddaf-4404-9732-666045e056b4)) |Medium |
|Role-Based Access Control should be used on Kubernetes Services |To provide granular filtering on the actions that users can perform, use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions in Kubernetes Service Clusters and configure relevant authorization policies. For more information, see <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/concepts-identity#role-based-access-controls-rbac'>Azure role-based access control</a>.<br />(Related policy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be used on Kubernetes Services](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fac4a19c2-fa67-49b4-8ae5-0b2e78c49457)) |High |
|Running containers as root user should be avoided |Containers should run as a non-root users in your Kubernetes cluster. Running a process as the root user inside a container runs it as root on the host. In case of compromise, an attacker has root in the container, and any mis-configurations become easier to exploit.<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster pods and containers should only run with approved user and group IDs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2ff06ddb64-5fa3-4b77-b166-acb36f7f6042)) |High |

|Usage of host networking and ports should be restricted |Restrict pod access to the host network and the allowable host port range in a Kubernetes cluster. Pods created with the hostNetwork attribute enabled will share the node's network space. To avoid compromised container from sniffing network traffic, we recommend not putting your pods on the host network. If you need to expose a container port on the node's network, and using a Kubernetes Service node port does not meet your needs, another possibility is to specify a hostPort for the container in the pod spec.<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster pods should only use approved host network and port range](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f82985f06-dc18-4a48-bc1c-b9f4f0098cfe)) |Medium |
|Usage of pod HostPath volume mounts should be restricted to a known list to restrict node access from compromised containers |We recommend limiting pod HostPath volume mounts in your Kubernetes cluster to the configured allowed host paths. In case of compromise, the container node access from the containers should be restricted<br />(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster pod hostPath volumes should only use allowed host paths](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f098fc59e-46c7-4d99-9b16-64990e543d75)) |Medium |
|Vulnerabilities in Azure Container Registry images should be remediated (powered by Qualys) |Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks.<br />(Related policy: [Vulnerabilities in Azure Container Registry images should be remediated](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f5f0f936f-2f01-4bf5-b6be-d423792fa562)) |High |
