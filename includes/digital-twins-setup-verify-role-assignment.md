One way to check that you've successfully set up the role assignment is to view the role assignments for the Azure Digital Twins instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Go to your Azure Digital Twins instance in the Azure portal (you can look it up on the page of [Azure Digital Twins instances](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.DigitalTwins%2FdigitalTwinsInstances) or search its name in the portal search bar).

Then, view all of its assigned roles under *Access control (IAM) > Role assignments*. The user should show up in the list with a role of *Azure Digital Twins Data Owner*.
