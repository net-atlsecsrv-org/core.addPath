## Configure the relying party policy

The relying party policy, for example [SignUpSignIn.xml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/blob/master/SocialAndLocalAccounts/SignUpOrSignin.xml), specifies the user journey which Azure AD B2C will execute. Find the **DefaultUserJourney** element within [relying party](../articles/active-directory-b2c/relyingparty.md). Update the  **ReferenceId** to match the user journey ID, in which you added the identity provider. 

In the following example, for the `CustomSignUpOrSignIn` user journey, the **ReferenceId** is set to `CustomSignUpOrSignIn`:

```xml
<RelyingParty>
  <DefaultUserJourney ReferenceId="CustomSignUpSignIn" />
  ...
</RelyingParty>
```

### Upload the custom policy

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select the **Directory + Subscription** icon in the portal toolbar, and then select the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Under **Policies**, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **Upload Custom Policy**, and then upload the two policy files that you changed, in the following order: the extension policy, for example `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`, then the relying party policy, such as `SignUpSignIn.xml`.
