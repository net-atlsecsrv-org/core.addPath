Azure Data Explorer encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For additional control over encryption keys, you can supply customer-managed keys to use for data encryption. Customer-managed keys must be stored in an [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview). You can create your own keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use an Azure Key Vault API to generate keys. The Azure Data Explorer cluster and the key vault must be in the same region, but they can be in different subscriptions. For a detailed explanation on customer-managed keys, see [customer-managed keys with Azure Key Vault](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption). This article shows you how to configure customer-managed keys.

To configure customer-managed keys with Azure Data Explorer, you must [set two properties on the key vault](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete): **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge**. These properties aren't enabled by default. To enable these properties, use [PowerShell](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-soft-delete-powershell) or [Azure CLI](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-soft-delete-cli). Only RSA keys and key size 2048 are supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Data encryption using customer managed keys is not supported on [leader and follower clusters](/azure/data-explorer/follower). 

## Assign an identity to the cluster

To enable customer-managed keys for your cluster, first assign a system-assigned managed identity to the cluster. You'll use this managed identity to grant the cluster permissions to access the key vault. To configure system-assigned managed identities, see [managed identities](/azure/data-explorer/managed-identities).

## Create a new key vault

To create a new key vault using PowerShell, call [New-AzKeyVault](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/new-azkeyvault). The key vault that you use to store customer-managed keys for Azure Data Explorer encryption must have two key protection settings enabled, **Soft Delete** and **Do Not Purge**. Replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values in example below.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$keyVault = New-AzKeyVault -Name <key-vault> `
    -ResourceGroupName <resource_group> `
    -Location <location> `
    -EnableSoftDelete `
    -EnablePurgeProtection
```

## Configure the key vault access policy

Next, configure the access policy for the key vault so that the cluster has permissions to access it. In this step, you'll use the system-assigned managed identity that you previously assigned to the cluster. To set the access policy for the key vault, call [Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/set-azkeyvaultaccesspolicy). Replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values and use the variables defined in the previous examples.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy `
    -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName `
    -ObjectId $cluster.Identity.PrincipalId `
    -PermissionsToKeys wrapkey,unwrapkey,get,recover
```

## Create a new key

Next, create a new key in the key vault. To create a new key, call [Add-AzKeyVaultKey](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/add-azkeyvaultkey). Replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values and use the variables defined in the previous examples.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$key = Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName -Name <key> -Destination 'Software'
```
