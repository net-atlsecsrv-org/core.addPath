## Network requirements

**Component** | **Requirement** 
--- | --- 
IP address type | Static 
Ports | 443 (Control channel orchestration)<br>9443 (Data transport) 
NIC type | VMXNET3 (if the Configuration Server is a VMware VM)
 |
**Internet access**  (The server needs access to following URLs - directly or via proxy):|
\*.backup.windowsazure.com | Used for replicated data transfer and coordination
\*.store.core.windows.net | Used for replicated data transfer and coordination
\*.blob.core.windows.net | Used to access storage account that stores replicated data
\*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com | Used for replication management operations and coordination
https:\//management.azure.com | Used for replication management operations and coordination 
*.services.visualstudio.com | Used for telemetry purposes (It is optional)
time.nist.gov | Used to check time synchronization between system and global time.
time.windows.com | Used to check time synchronization between system and global time.
| <ul> <li> https:\//login.microsoftonline.com </li><li> https:\//secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com </li><li> https:\//login.live.com </li><li> https:\//graph.windows.net </li><li> https:\//login.windows.net </li><li> https:\//www.live.com </li><li> https:\//www.microsoft.com </li></ul> | OVF set-up needs access to these URLs. They are used for access control and identity management by Azure Active Directory
https:\//dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLInstaller/mysql-installer-community-5.7.20.0.msi  | To complete MySQL download. </br> In few regions, the download might be redirected to CDN URL. Ensure that the CDN URL is also whitelisted, if necessary.

## Required software

**Component** | **Requirement** 
--- | ---
VMware vSphere PowerCLI | [PowerCLI version 6.0](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?productId=491&downloadGroup=PCLI600R1) should be installed if the Configuration Server is running on a VMware VM.
MYSQL | MySQL should be installed. You can install manually, or Site Recovery can install it. (Refer to [configure settings](../articles/site-recovery/vmware-azure-deploy-configuration-server.md#configure-settings) for more information)

## Sizing and capacity requirements

The following table summarizes capacity requirements for the configuration server. If you're replicating multiple VMware VMs, you should review the [capacity planning considerations](../articles/site-recovery/site-recovery-plan-capacity-vmware.md) and run the [Azure Site Recovery Deployment Planner tool](../articles/site-recovery/site-recovery-deployment-planner.md).
