The following PowerShell command will deny all traffic to the storage account's public endpoint. Note that this command has the `-Bypass` parameter set to `AzureServices`. This will allow trusted first party services such as Azure File Sync to access the storage account via the public endpoint.

```PowerShell
# This assumes $storageAccount is still defined from the beginning of this of this guide.
$storageAccount | Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet `
        -DefaultAction Deny `
        -Bypass AzureServices `
        -WarningAction SilentlyContinue `
        -ErrorAction Stop | `
    Out-Null
```
