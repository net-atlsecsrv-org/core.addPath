In a Java project, the bindings are defined as binding annotations on the function method. The *function.json* file is then autogenerated based on these annotations.

Browse to the location of your function code under _src/main/java_, open the *Function.java* project file, and add the following parameter to the `run` method definition:

```java
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg
```

The `msg` parameter is an [`OutputBinding<T>`](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding) type, which represents a collection of strings that are written as messages to an output binding when the function completes. In this case, the output is a storage queue named `outqueue`. The connection string for the Storage account is set by the `connection` method. Rather than the connection string itself, you pass the application setting that contains the Storage account connection string.

The `run` method definition should now look like the following example:  

```java
@FunctionName("HttpTrigger-Java")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
        @HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION)  
        HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request, 
        @QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") 
        OutputBinding<String> msg, final ExecutionContext context) {
    ...
}
```
