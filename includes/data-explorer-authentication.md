## Authentication

To run the following example, you need an Azure AD Application and service principal that can access resources. See [create an Azure AD application](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a free Azure AD Application and add role assignment at the subscription level. You also need the `directory (tenant) ID`, `application ID`, and `client secret`.
