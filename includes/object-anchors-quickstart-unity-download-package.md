The next step is to download the Azure Object Anchors package for Unity.

# [Download with web browser](#tab/unity-package-web-ui)

Locate the Azure Object Anchors package for Unity [here](https://aka.ms/aoa/unity-sdk/package). Select the version you want and download the package using the **Download** button.

# [Download with NPM](#tab/unity-package-npm)

This step requires that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">NPM</a> is installed and available.

Run the following command replacing `<version_number>` with the version of Azure Object Anchors you want to download:

```bash
npm pack com.microsoft.azure.object-anchors.runtime@<version_number> --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/aipmr/MixedReality-Unity-Packages/_packaging/Unity-packages/npm/registry/
```

> [!NOTE]
> To list the available versions of the Azure Object Anchors package, run the following:
>
> ```bash
> npm view com.microsoft.azure.object-anchors.runtime --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/aipmr/MixedReality-Unity-Packages/_packaging/Unity-packages/npm/registry/ versions
> ```

The Azure Object Anchors package will be downloaded to the folder where you ran the command.

# [Install with Mixed Reality Feature Tool (beta)](#tab/unity-package-mixed-reality-feature-tool)

Continue to the next step. You'll use the <a a href="https://aka.ms/MRFeatureToolDocs" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Feature Tool</a> in a later step.
