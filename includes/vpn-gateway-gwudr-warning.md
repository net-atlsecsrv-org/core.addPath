User-defined routes with a 0.0.0.0/0 destination and NSGs on the GatewaySubnet **are not supported**. Gateways created with this configuration will be blocked from creation. Gateways require access to the management controllers in order to function properly. [BGP Route Propagation](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#border-gateway-protocol) should be set to "Enabled" on the GatewaySubnet to ensure availability of the gateway. If this is set to disabled, the gateway will not function.
