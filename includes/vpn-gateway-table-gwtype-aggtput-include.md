(*) Use [Virtual WAN](../articles/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about.md) if you need more than 30 S2S VPN tunnels.

* Aggregate Throughput Benchmark is based on measurements of multiple tunnels aggregated through a single gateway. The Aggregate Throughput Benchmark for a VPN Gateway is S2S + P2S combined. **If you have a lot of P2S connections, it can negatively impact a S2S connection due to throughput limitations.** The Aggregate Throughput Benchmark is not a guaranteed throughput due to Internet traffic conditions and your application behaviors.

* These connection limits are separate. For example, you can have 128 SSTP connections and also 250 IKEv2 connections on a VpnGw1 SKU.

* Pricing information can be found on the [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway) page.

* SLA (Service Level Agreement) information can be found on the [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/vpn-gateway/) page.

* VpnGw1, VpnGw2, and VpnGw3 are supported for VPN gateways using the Resource Manager deployment model only.

* The Basic SKU is considered a legacy SKU. The Basic SKU has certain feature limitations. You can't resize a gateway that uses a Basic SKU to one of the new gateway SKUs, you must instead change to a new SKU, which involves deleting and recreating your VPN gateway. Verify that the feature that you need is supported before you use the Basic SKU.
