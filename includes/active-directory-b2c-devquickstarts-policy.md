> [!NOTE]
> In Azure AD B2C, your user flow name will be prefixed with `b2c_1_`, like `b2c_1_sign_up`.  You are free to use your user flows across all of your apps, both client and server.  If you've previously created user flows in another B2C walk-through, there is no need to do so again. You may reuse the user flows you've previously created in the portal if they match the requirements of the application.
