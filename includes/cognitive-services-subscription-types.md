You can access Azure Cognitive Services through two different resources: A multi-service resource, or a single-service one.

* Multi-service resource:
    * Access multiple Azure Cognitive Services with a single key and endpoint.
    * Consolidates billing from the services you use.
* Single-service resource:
    * Access a single Azure Cognitive Service with a unique key and endpoint for each service created. 
    * Use the free tier to try out the service.
