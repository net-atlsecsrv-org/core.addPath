## Visualization

While the primary way to interact with your Azure Digital Twins instance is through the [APIs and SDKs](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-use-apis-sdks.md), it can be helpful to see a visualization of the twins and graphs that you are creating in your instance.

The [**Azure Digital Twins explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-explorer/digital-twins-explorer/) is a sample application for visualizing and working with Azure Digital Twins. Follow the instructions provided with the sample to download and run the application code. 

With this sample, you can see a visual representation of your digital twins and the graph that they create, among other creation and management activities.

Here's a view of what the sample visualization looks like:

You can also use the sample to...
* Upload and explore models
* Upload and edit graphs of twins
* Visualize the twins graph with a number of layout techniques
* Edit properties of twins
* Run queries against the twins graph
