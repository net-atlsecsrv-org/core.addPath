   Field|Description
   ---|---
   Workspace name |Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. In this example, we use **docs-ws**. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others.
   Subscription |Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.
   Resource group | Use an existing resource group in your subscription, or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **docs-aml**. 
   Location | Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.
   Workspace edition | Select **Basic** as the workspace type for this tutorial. The workspace type determines the features to which you'll have access and pricing. Everything in this tutorial can be performed with either a Basic or Enterprise workspace.

1. After you're finished configuring the workspace, select **Review + Create**.

   > [!Warning]
   > It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud.

   When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears.
 
 1. To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**.
