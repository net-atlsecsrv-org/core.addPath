1. Review your Digital Twins information, and then select **Create**. Your Digital Twins instance might take a few minutes to be created. You can monitor the progress in the **Notifications** pane.

1. Open the **Overview** pane of your Digital Twins instance. Note the link under **Management API**.

   The **Management API** URL is formatted as `https://yourDigitalTwinsName.yourLocation.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger`. This URL takes you to the Azure Digital Twins REST API documentation that applies to your instance. Read [How to use Azure Digital Twins Swagger](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-use-swagger.md) to learn how to read and use this API documentation.

    Modify the **Management API** URL to this format `https://yourDigitalTwinsName.yourLocation.azuresmartspaces.net/management/api/v1.0/`. Your application will use the modified URL as the base URL to access your instance. Copy this modified URL to a temporary file. You'll need this in the next section.
