## Prerequisite: Install the Azure CLI
To perform the steps in this article, you need to [install the Azure Command-Line Interface for Mac, Linux, and Windows (Azure CLI)](../articles/cli-install-nodejs.md) and you need to [sign in to Azure](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli). 

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have an Azure account, you need one. Go sign up for a [free trial here](../articles/active-directory/fundamentals/sign-up-organization.md). In addition, to follow along completely you need to have either [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or some other JSON parsing tool or library installed.
