To run this sample, make sure you have installed the latest version of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). To start, run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Install the Azure CLI on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows).
