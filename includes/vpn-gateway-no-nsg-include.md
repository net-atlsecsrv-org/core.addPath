> [!IMPORTANT]
> When working with gateway subnets, avoid associating a network security group (NSG) to the gateway subnet. Associating a network security group to this subnet may cause your VPN gateway to stop functioning as expected. For more information about network security groups, see [What is a network security group?](../articles/virtual-network/security-overview.md)
