### Alerts API
Azure Monitor Alerts have several throttling limits to protect against users making an excessive number of calls. Such behavior can potentially overload the system backend resources and jeopardize service responsiveness. The following limits are designed to protect customers from interruptions and ensure consistent service level. The user throttling and limits are designed to impact only extreme usage scenario and should not be relevant for typical usage.
