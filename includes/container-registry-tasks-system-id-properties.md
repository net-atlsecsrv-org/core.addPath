In the command output, the `identity` section shows an identity of type `SystemAssigned` is set in the task. The `principalId` is the principal ID of the task identity:

```console
[...]
  "identity": {
    "principalId": "xxxxxxxx-2703-42f9-97d0-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-86f1-41af-91ab-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": null
  },
  "location": "eastus",
[...]
``` 
Use the [az acr task show][az-acr-task-show] command to store the principalId in a variable, to use in later commands. Substitute the name of your task and your registry in the following command:

```azurecli
principalID=$(az acr task show \
  --name <task_name> --registry <registry_name> \
  --query identity.principalId --output tsv)
```
