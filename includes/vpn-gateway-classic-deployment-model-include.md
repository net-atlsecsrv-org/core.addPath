> This article is written for the classic deployment model. If you're new to Azure, we recommend that you use the Resource Manager deployment model instead. The Resource Manager deployment model is the most current deployment model and offers more options and feature compatibility than the classic deployment model. For more information about the deployment models, see [Understanding deployment models](../articles/resource-manager-deployment-model.md).
