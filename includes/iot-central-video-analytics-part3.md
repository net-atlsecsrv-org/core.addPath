## Version the device template

The video analytics - object and motion detection application includes an **LVA Edge Gateway** device template. To use the updated deployment manifest file with this device template, you must create and publish a new version of the template.

To create a new version of the template:

1. In your IoT Central application, navigate to **Device Templates**, and select the **LVA Edge Gateway** device template.

1. Select **Version** to create a new template called **LVA Edge Gateway v2** and then select **Create**.

The new **LVA Edge Gateway v2** device template is now in your list of device templates.
