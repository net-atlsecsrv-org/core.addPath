Depending on your environment and choices, the script can create all the cluster infrastructure, including the Azure virtual network, storage accounts, cloud services, domain controller, remote or local SQL databases, head node, and additional cluster nodes. Alternatively, the script can use pre-existing Azure infrastructure and create only the HPC cluster nodes.

For background information about planning an HPC Pack cluster, see the [Product Evaluation and Planning](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj899596.aspx) and [Getting Started](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj899590.aspx) content in the HPC Pack 2012 R2 TechNet Library.

## Prerequisites
* **Azure subscription**: You can use a subscription in either the Azure Global or Azure China service. Your subscription limits affect the number and type of cluster nodes you can deploy. For information, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](../articles/azure-subscription-service-limits.md).
* **Windows client computer with Azure PowerShell 0.8.10 or later installed and configured**: See [Get started with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) for installation instructions and steps to connect to your Azure subscription.
* **HPC Pack IaaS deployment script**: Download and unpack the latest version of the script from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44949). Check the version of the script by running `New-HPCIaaSCluster.ps1 –Version`. This article is based on version 4.5.2 of the script.
* **Script configuration file**: Create an XML file that the script uses to configure the HPC cluster. For information and examples, see sections later in this article and the file Manual.rtf that accompanies the deployment script.

## Syntax
```powershell
New-HPCIaaSCluster.ps1 [-ConfigFile] <String> [-AdminUserName]<String> [[-AdminPassword] <String>] [[-HPCImageName] <String>] [[-LogFile] <String>] [-Force] [-NoCleanOnFailure] [-PSSessionSkipCACheck] [<CommonParameters>]
```
> [!NOTE]
> Run the script as an administrator.
> 
> 

### Parameters
* **ConfigFile**: Specifies the file path of the configuration file to describe the HPC cluster. See more about the configuration file in this topic, or in the file Manual.rtf in the folder containing the script.
* **AdminUserName**: Specifies the user name. If the domain forest is created by the script, this becomes the local administrator user name for all VMs and the domain administrator name. If the domain forest already exists, this specifies the domain user as the local administrator user name to install HPC Pack.
* **AdminPassword**: Specifies the administrator’s password. If not specified in the command line, the script prompts you to input the password.
* **HPCImageName** (optional): Specifies the HPC Pack VM image name used to deploy the HPC cluster. It must be a Microsoft-provided HPC Pack image from the Azure Marketplace. If not specified (recommended usually), the script chooses the latest published [HPC Pack 2012 R2 image](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsoft/hpcpack2012r2onwindowsserver2012r2/). The latest image is based on Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter with HPC Pack 2012 R2 Update 3 installed.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > Deployment fails if you don't specify a valid HPC Pack image.
  > 
  > 
* **LogFile** (optional): Specifies the deployment log file path. If not specified, the script creates a log file in the temp directory of the computer running the script.
* **Force** (optional): Suppresses all the confirmation prompts.
* **NoCleanOnFailure** (optional): Specifies that the Azure VMs that are not successfully deployed are not removed. Remove these VMs manually before rerunning the script to continue the deployment, or the deployment may fail.
* **PSSessionSkipCACheck** (optional): For every cloud service with VMs deployed by this script, a self-signed certificate is automatically generated by Azure, and all the VMs in the cloud service use this certificate as the default Windows Remote Management (WinRM) certificate. To deploy HPC features in these Azure VMs, the script by default temporarily installs these certificates in the Local Computer\\Trusted Root Certification Authorities store of the client computer to suppress the “not trusted CA” security error during script execution. The certificates are removed when the script finishes. If this parameter is specified, the certificates are not installed in the client computer, and the security warning is suppressed.
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This parameter is not recommended for production deployments.
  >

### Example
The following example creates an HPC Pack cluster using the
configuration file *MyConfigFile.xml*, and specifies administrator
credentials for installing the cluster.

```powershell
.\New-HPCIaaSCluster.ps1 –ConfigFile MyConfigFile.xml -AdminUserName <username> –AdminPassword <password>
```

### Additional considerations
* The script can optionally enable job submission through the HPC Pack web portal or the HPC Pack REST API.
* The script can optionally run custom pre- and post-configuration scripts on the head node if you want to install additional software or configure other settings.

## Configuration file
The configuration file for the deployment script is an XML
file. The schema file HPCIaaSClusterConfig.xsd is in the HPC Pack IaaS
deployment script folder. **IaaSClusterConfig** is the root element of
the configuration file, which contains the child elements described in
detail in the file Manual.rtf in the deployment script folder.
