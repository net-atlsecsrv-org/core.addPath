Azure allows you to place _locks_ on resources, so that they cannot be deleted or are read only. __Locking a resource can lead to unexpected results.__ Some operations that don't seem to modify the resource actually require actions that are blocked by the lock. 

For example, applying a delete lock to the resource group for your workspace will prevent scaling operations for Azure ML compute clusters.

For more information on locking resources, see [Lock resources to prevent unexpected changes](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md).
