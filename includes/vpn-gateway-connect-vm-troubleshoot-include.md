If you are having trouble connecting to a virtual machine over your VPN connection, check the following:

- Verify that your VPN connection is successful.
- Verify that you are connecting to the private IP address for the VM.
- If you can connect to the VM using the private IP address, but not the computer name, verify that you have configured DNS properly. For more information about how name resolution works for VMs, see [Name Resolution for VMs](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md).

When you connect over Point-to-Site, check the following additional items:

- Use 'ipconfig' to check the IPv4 address assigned to the Ethernet adapter on the computer from which you are connecting. If the IP address is within the address range of the VNet that you are connecting to, or within the address range of your VPNClientAddressPool, this is referred to as an overlapping address space. When your address space overlaps in this way, the network traffic doesn't reach Azure, it stays on the local network.
- Verify that the VPN client configuration package was generated after the DNS server IP addresses were specified for the VNet. If you updated the DNS server IP addresses, generate and install a new VPN client configuration package.
