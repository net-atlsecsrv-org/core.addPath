[Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/overview) enables you to build and host code. This code can be in the form of web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs. Using App Service, you can develop you code using the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. App Service supports both Windows and Linux. Automated deployments from any Git repo are supported, including GitHub and Azure DevOps.
