An [App Service plan](../articles/app-service/overview-hosting-plans.md) specifies the location, size, and features of the web server farm that hosts your app. You can save money when hosting multiple apps by configuring the web apps to share a single App Service plan.

App Service plans define:

* Region (for example: North Europe, East US, or Southeast Asia)
* Instance size (small, medium, or large)
* Scale count (1 to 20 instances)
* SKU (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, or Premium)
