> When creating user assigned identities, only alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z), the underscore (\_) and the hyphen (-) are supported. Additionally, the name should be atleast 3 characters and up to 128 characters in length for the assignment to VM/VMSS to work properly. Check back for updates.
