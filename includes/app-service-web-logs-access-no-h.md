To access the console logs generated from inside your application code in App Service, turn on diagnostics logging by running the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp log config --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --application-logging true --level Verbose
```

Possible values for `--level` are: `Error`, `Warning`, `Info`, and `Verbose`. Each subsequent level includes the previous level. For example: `Error` includes only error messages, and `Verbose` includes all messages.

Once diagnostic logging is turned on, run the following command to see the log stream:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp log tail --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name>
```

If you don't see console logs immediately, check again in 30 seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also inspect the log files from the browser at `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker`.

To stop log streaming at any time, type `Ctrl`+`C`.
