| Compute target | Usage | GPU support | FPGA support | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Local web service](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where.md#local) | Testing/debug | maybe | &nbsp; | Good for limited testing and troubleshooting. Hardware acceleration depends on using libraries in the local system.
| [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where.md#aks) | Real-time inference |  [yes](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-inferencing-gpus.md)  | [yes](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md)   |Good for high-scale production deployments. Provides autoscaling and fast response times.  AKS is the only option available for the visual interface. |
| [Azure Container Instances (ACI)](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where.md#aci) | Testing or dev | &nbsp;  | &nbsp; | Good for low scale, CPU-based workloads requiring <48-GB RAM |
| [Azure Machine Learning Compute](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-run-batch-predictions.md) | (Preview) Batch inference | yes | &nbsp;  | Run batch scoring on serverless compute. Supports normal and low-priority VMs. |
| [Azure IoT Edge](../articles/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where.md#iotedge) | (Preview) IoT module |  &nbsp; | &nbsp; | Deploy & serve ML models on IoT devices. |
| [Azure Data Box Edge](../articles/databox-online/data-box-edge-overview.md)   | via IoT Edge |  &nbsp; | yes | Deploy & serve ML models on IoT devices. |
