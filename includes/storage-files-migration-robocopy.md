```console
Robocopy /MT:16 /NP /NFL /NDL /B /MIR /IT /COPY:DATSO /COPY:DATSO /DCOPY:DAT /UNILOG:<FilePathAndName> <SourcePath> <Dest.Path> 
```

| Switch              | Meaning |
|---------------------|---------|
| /MT                 | Allows for RoboCopy to run multi-threaded. Default is 8, and the maximum is 128. Match this value to your processor core count and thread count per core. Consider if cores need to be reserved for other tasks a production server may have. |
| /NP                 | Progress of the copy for each file and folder won't be displayed. Displaying the progress significantly lowers copy performance. |
| /NFL                | Specifies that file names aren't logged. Improves copy performance. |
| /NDL                | Specifies that directory names aren't logged. Improves copy performance. |
| /B                  | Runs RoboCopy in the same mode a backup application would use. It allows RoboCopy to move files that the current user doesn't have permissions to. |
| /MIR                | *Mirror source to target* allows RoboCopy to only have to copy deltas between source and target. Empty subdirectories will be copied. Items (files or folders) that have changed or don't exist on the target will be copied. Items that exist on the target but not on the source will be purged (deleted) from the target. When using this switch, it's imperative that you match source and target folder structure exactly. "Matching" means that you copy from the correct source and folder level to the matching folder level on the target. Only then can a "catch up" copy be successful. When source and target are mismatched, using `/MIR` will lead to large scale deletes and recopies. |
| /IT                 | Ensures fidelity is preserved in certain mirror scenarios. </br>*Example* - If between two RoboCopy runs a file experiences an ACL change and an attribute update: for instance, it's marked *hidden*. Without /IT, the ACL change can be missed by RoboCopy and not transferred to the target location. |
|/COPY:`[copyflags]`  | Fidelity of the file copy (default if not specified is `/COPY:DAT`), copy flags: `D`=Data, `A`=Attributes, `T`=Timestamps, `S`=Security=NTFS ACLs, `O`=Owner information, `U`=A<u>u</u>diting information. Auditing information cannot be stored in an Azure file share. |
| /DCOPY:`[copyflags]`| Fidelity for the copy of directories (default if not specified is `/DCOPY:DA`), copy flags: `D`=Data, `A`=Attributes, `T`=Timestamps. |
| /UNILOG:<file name> | Outputs status to LOG file as UNICODE (overwrites existing log). |
| /LFSM               | **only for targets with tiered storage** </br>Using /LFSM requests RoboCopy to operate in 'low free space mode'. This switch is only useful for targets with tiered storage, that may run out of local capacity before RoboCopy can finish. This switch was added specifically for use with an Azure File Sync cloud tiering enabled target. It can be used independent of Azure File Sync. In this mode, RoboCopy will pause whenever a file copy would cause the destination volume's free space to go below a 'floor' value. This value can be specified by the `/LFSM:n` form of the flag. The parameter `n` is specified in base 2: `nKB`, `nMB`, or `nGB`. If `/LFSM` is specified with no explicit floor value, the floor is set to 10 percent of the destination volume's size. Low free space mode is incompatible with /MT, /EFSRAW, /B, and /ZB. |
| /Z                  | **careful use** </br>Copies files in restart mode, use is only recommended in an unstable network environment. This option significantly reduces copy performance because of extra logging. |
| /ZB                 | **careful use** </br>Uses restart mode. If access is denied, this option uses backup mode. This option significantly reduces copy performance because of checkpointing. |
