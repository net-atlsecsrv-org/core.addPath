```console
Robocopy /MT:32 /R:5 /W:5 /B /MIR /IT /COPY:DATSO /DCOPY:DAT /NP /NFL /NDL /UNILOG:<FilePathAndName> <SourcePath> <Dest.Path> 
```

| Switch                | Meaning |
|-----------------------|---------|
| `/MT:n`               | Allows Robocopy to run multithreaded. Default for `n` is 8. The maximum is 128 threads. Start with a high thread count for an initial run. A high thread count helps saturate the available bandwidth. Subsequent `/MIR` runs are progressively affected when you process items over network transport. For subsequent runs, match your thread count value to your processor core count and thread count per core. Consider whether cores need to be reserved for other tasks that a production server might have. |
| `/R:n`                | Maximum retry count for a file that fails to copy on first attempt. You can improve the speed of a Robocopy run by specifying a maximum number (`n`) of retries before the file permanently fails to copy in the run. This switch works when it's already clear that there will be more Robocopy runs. If the file fails to copy in the current run, the next Robocopy job will try again. Files that failed because they were in use or because of timeout issues might eventually be copied successfully if you use this approach. |
| `/W:n`                | Specifies the time Robocopy waits before attempting to copy a file that didn't successfully copy during a previous attempt. `n` is the number of seconds to wait between retries. `/W:n` is often used together with `/R:n`. |
| `/B`                  | Runs Robocopy in the same mode that a backup application would use. This switch allows Robocopy to move files that the current user doesn't have permissions for. |
| `/MIR`                | (Mirror source to target.) Allows Robocopy to copy only deltas between source and target. Empty subdirectories will be copied. Items (files or folders) that have changed or don't exist on the target will be copied. Items that exist on the target but not on the source will be purged (deleted) from the target. When you use this switch, match the source and target folder structures exactly. *Matching* means copying from the correct source and folder level to the matching folder level on the target. Only then can a "catch up" copy be successful. When source and target are mismatched, using `/MIR` will lead to large-scale deletions and recopies. |
| `/IT`                 | Ensures fidelity is preserved in certain mirror scenarios. </br>For example, if a file experiences an ACL change and an attribute update between two Robocopy runs, it's marked hidden. Without `/IT`, the ACL change might be missed by Robocopy and not transferred to the target location. |
|`/COPY:[copyflags]`    | The fidelity of the file copy. Default: `/COPY:DAT`. Copy flags: `D`= Data, `A`= Attributes, `T`= Timestamps, `S`= Security = NTFS ACLs, `O`= Owner information, `U`= A<u>u</u>diting information. Auditing information can't be stored in an Azure file share. |
| `/DCOPY:[copyflags]`  | Fidelity for the copy of directories. Default: `/DCOPY:DA`. Copy flags: `D`= Data, `A`= Attributes, `T`= Timestamps. |
| `/NP`                 | Specifies that the progress of the copy for each file and folder won't be displayed. Displaying the progress significantly lowers copy performance. |
| `/NFL`                | Specifies that file names aren't logged. Improves copy performance. |
| `/NDL`                | Specifies that directory names aren't logged. Improves copy performance. |
| `/UNILOG:<file name>` | Writes status to the log file as Unicode. (Overwrites the existing log.) |
| `/LFSM`               | **Only for targets with tiered storage** </br>Specifies that Robocopy operates in "low free space mode." This switch is useful only for targets with tiered storage that might run out of local capacity before Robocopy finishes. It was added specifically for use with a target enabled for Azure File Sync cloud tiering. It can be used independently of Azure File Sync. In this mode, Robocopy will pause whenever a file copy would cause the destination volume's free space to go below a "floor" value. This value can be specified by the `/LFSM:n` form of the flag. The parameter `n` is specified in base 2: `nKB`, `nMB`, or `nGB`. If `/LFSM` is specified with no explicit floor value, the floor is set to 10 percent of the destination volume's size. Low free space mode isn't compatible with `/MT`, `/EFSRAW`, `/B`, or `/ZB`. |
| `/Z`                  | **Use cautiously** </br>Copies files in restart mode. This switch is recommended only in an unstable network environment. It significantly reduces copy performance because of extra logging. |
| `/ZB`                 | **Use cautiously** </br>Uses restart mode. If access is denied, this option uses backup mode. This option significantly reduces copy performance because of checkpointing. |
