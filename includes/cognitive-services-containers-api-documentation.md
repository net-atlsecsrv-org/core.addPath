## Validate that a container is running 

There are several ways to validate that the container is running. Locate the *External IP* address and exposed port of the container in question, and open your favorite web browser. Use the various request URLs below to validate the container is running. The example request URLs listed below are `http://localhost:5000`, but your specific container may vary. Keep in mind that you're to rely on your container's *External IP* address and exposed port.

| Request URL | Purpose |
|--|--|
| `http://localhost:5000/` | The container provides a home page. |
| `http://localhost:5000/ready` | Requested with GET, this provides a verification that the container is ready to accept a query against the model.  This request can be used for Kubernetes [liveness and readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/). |
| `http://localhost:5000/status` | Also requested with GET, this verifies if the api-key used to start the container is valid without causing an endpoint query. This request can be used for Kubernetes [liveness and readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/). |
| `http://localhost:5000/swagger` | The container provides a full set of documentation for the endpoints and a **Try it out** feature. With this feature, you can enter your settings into a web-based HTML form and make the query without having to write any code. After the query returns, an example CURL command is provided to demonstrate the HTTP headers and body format that's required. |
