A formula in Azure DevTest Labs is a list of default property values used to create a virtual machine (VM). When creating a VM from a formula, the default values can be used as-is, or modified. Like [custom images](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-create-template.md) and [Marketplace images](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-configure-marketplace-images.md), formulas provide a mechanism for fast VM provisioning. Similar to [custom images](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-create-template.md), formulas enable you to create a base image from a VHD file. The base image can then be used to provision a new VM. To help decide which is right for your particular environment, refer to the article, [Comparing custom images and formulas in DevTest Labs](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-comparing-vm-base-image-types.md).
