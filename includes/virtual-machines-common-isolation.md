Azure Compute offers virtual machine sizes that are Isolated to a specific hardware type and dedicated to a single customer. The Isolated sizes live and operate on specific hardware generation and will be deprecated when the hardware generation is retired.

Isolated virtual machine sizes are best suited for workloads that require a high degree of isolation from other customersâ€™ workloads for reasons that include meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.  Utilizing an isolated size guarantees that your virtual machine will be the only one running on that specific server instance. 


Additionally, as the Isolated size VMs are large, customers may choose to subdivide the resources of these VMs by using [Azure support for nested virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/).

The current Isolated virtual machine offerings include:
* Standard_E80ids_v4
* Standard_E80is_v4
* Standard_F72s_v2
* Standard_E64is_v3
* Standard_E64i_v3
* Standard_M128ms
* Standard_GS5
* Standard_G5
* Standard_DC8_v2

> Isolated VM Sizes have a hardware limited lifespan. Please see below for details

## Deprecation of Isolated VM Sizes

Isolated VM sizes have a hardware limited lifespan. Azure will issue reminders 12 months in advance of the official deprecation date of the sizes and will provide an updated isolated offering for your consideration.

| Size | Isolation Retirement Date | 
| --- | --- |
| Standard_DS15_v2 | May 15, 2021 |
| Standard_D15_v2  | May 15, 2021 |
| Standard_G5  | February 15, 2022 |
| Standard_GS5  | February 15, 2022 |
| Standard_E64i_v3  | February 15, 2022 |
| Standard_E64is_v3  | February 15, 2022 |
| Standard_DC8_v2 | February 15, 2022 |


## FAQ
### Q: Is the size going to get retired or only its "isolation" feature?
**A**: Currently, only the isolation feature of the VM sizes is being retired. The deprecated isolated sizes will continue to exist in non-isolated state. If isolation is not needed, there is no action to be taken and the VM will continue to work as expected.

### Q: Is there a downtime when my vm lands on a non-isolated hardware?
**A**: If there is no need of isolation, no action is needed and there will be no downtime. 
On contrary if isolation is required, our announcement will include the recommended replacement size. Selecting the replacement size will require our customers to resize their VMs.  

### Q: Is there any cost delta for moving to a non-isolated virtual machine?
**A**: No

### Q: When are the other isolated sizes going to retire?
**A**: We will provide reminders 12 months in advance of the official deprecation of the isolated size. Our latest announcement includes isolation feature retirement of Standard_G5, Standard_GS5, Standard_E64i_v3 and Standard_E64i_v3.  

### Q: I'm an Azure Service Fabric Customer relying on the Silver or Gold Durability Tiers. Does this change impact me?
**A**: No. The guarantees provided by Service Fabric's [Durability Tiers](../articles/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity.md#durability-characteristics-of-the-cluster) will continue to function even after this change. If you require physical hardware isolation for other reasons, you may still need to take one of the actions described above. 
 
### Q: What are the milestones for D15_v2 or DS15_v2 isolation retirement? 
**A**: 
 
| Date | Action |
|---|---| 
| May 15, 2020<sup>1</sup> | D/DS15_v2 isolation retirement announcement| 
| May 15, 2021 | D/DS15_v2 isolation guarantee removed|
