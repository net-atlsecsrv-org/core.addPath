   Resource group | Use an existing resource group in your subscription, or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **docs-aml**. 
   Location | Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.
   Workspace edition | Select **Enterprise**. This tutorial requires the use of the Enterprise edition. The Enterprise edition is in preview and doesn't currently add any extra costs. 

1. After you're finished configuring the workspace, select **Create**.

   > It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud.

   When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears.
