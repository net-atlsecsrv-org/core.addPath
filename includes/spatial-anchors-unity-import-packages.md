Open your project in Unity. Follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-tarball.html" target="_blank">here</a> to import
the Azure Spatial Anchors packages that you downloaded into the Unity project using the Unity Package Manager.

You can expand the `Packages` folder in your Project view to verify that the right packages have been imported.
