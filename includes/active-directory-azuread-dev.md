> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Microsoft identity platform (v2.0)](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) is an [evolution of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) developer platform (v1.0)](../articles/active-directory/azuread-dev/about-microsoft-identity-platform.md). It allows developers to build applications that sign in all Microsoft identities and get tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as Microsoft Graph or APIs that developers have built.
> This content is for the older, Azure AD v1.0 endpoint. We recommend that you use the v2.0 endpoint for new projects. For more info, read [Why update to Microsoft identity platform (v2.0)?](/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) as well as [Microsoft identity platform limitations](/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison#limitations).
