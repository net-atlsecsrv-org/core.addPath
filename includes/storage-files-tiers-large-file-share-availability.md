Standard file shares with 100 TiB capacity have certain limitations.

- Currently, only locally redundant storage (LRS) and zone redundant storage (ZRS) accounts are supported.
- Once you enable large file shares, you cannot convert storage accounts to geo-redundant storage (GRS) or geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) accounts.
- Once you enable large file shares, you can't disable it.
