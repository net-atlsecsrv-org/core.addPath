When you're done with your app and Azure Cosmos DB account, you can delete the Azure resources you created so you don't incur more charges. To delete the resources:

1. In the Azure portal Search bar, search for and select **Resource groups**.

2. From the list, select the resource group you created for this quickstart.  

   ![Select the resource group to delete](./media/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group/delete-resources-select.png)

2. On the resource group **Overview** page, select **Delete resource group**.

   ![Delete the resource group](./media/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group/delete-resources.png)   

3. In the next window, enter the name of the resource group to delete, and then select **Delete**.
