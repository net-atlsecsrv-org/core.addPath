When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. When you select a higher gateway SKU, more CPUs and network bandwidth are allocated to the gateway, and as a result, the gateway can support higher network throughput to the virtual network. 

ExpressRoute virtual network gateways can use the following SKUs: 

* Standard
* HighPerformance
* UltraPerformance
