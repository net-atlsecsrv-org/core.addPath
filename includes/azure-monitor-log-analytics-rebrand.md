>[!NOTE]
> This article was recently updated to use the term Azure Monitor logs instead of Log Analytics. Log data is still stored in a Log Analytics workspace and is still collected and analyzed by the same Log Analytics service. We are updating the terminology to better reflect the role of [logs in Azure Monitor](../articles/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-logs.md). See [Azure Monitor terminology changes](../articles/azure-monitor/azure-monitor-rebrand.md) for details.
