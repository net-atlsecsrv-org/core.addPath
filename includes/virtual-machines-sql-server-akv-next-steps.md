## Next steps

After enabling Azure Key Vault Integration, you can enable SQL Server encryption on your SQL VM. First, you will need to create an asymmetric key inside your key vault and a symmetric key within SQL Server on your VM. Then, you will be able to execute T-SQL statements to enable encryption for your databases and backups.

There are several forms of encryption you can take advantage of:

* [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb934049.aspx)
* [Encrypted backups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn449489.aspx)
* [Column Level Encryption (CLE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173744.aspx)

The following Transact-SQL scripts provide examples for each of these areas.

### Prerequisites for examples

Each example is based on the two prerequisites: an asymmetric key from your key vault called **CONTOSO_KEY** and a credential created by the AKV Integration feature called **Azure_EKM_cred**. The following Transact-SQL commands setup these prerequisites for running the examples.

``` sql
USE master;
GO

--create credential
--The <<SECRET>> here requires the <Application ID> (without hyphens) and <Secret> to be passed together without a space between them.
CREATE CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_cred
    WITH IDENTITY = 'keytestvault', --keyvault
    SECRET = '<<SECRET>>'
FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER AzureKeyVault_EKM_Prov;


--Map the credential to a SQL login that has sysadmin permissions. This allows the SQL login to access the key vault when creating the asymmetric key in the next step.
ALTER LOGIN [SQL_Login]
ADD CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_cred;


CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY
FROM PROVIDER [AzureKeyVault_EKM_Prov]
WITH PROVIDER_KEY_NAME = 'KeyName_in_KeyVault',  --The key name here requires the key we created in the key vault
CREATION_DISPOSITION = OPEN_EXISTING;
```

### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

1. Create a SQL Server login to be used by the Database Engine for TDE, then add the credential to it.

   ``` sql
   USE master;
   -- Create a SQL Server login associated with the asymmetric key
   -- for the Database engine to use when it loads a database
   -- encrypted by TDE.
   CREATE LOGIN EKM_Login
   FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;
   GO

   -- Alter the TDE Login to add the credential for use by the
   -- Database Engine to access the key vault
   ALTER LOGIN EKM_Login
   ADD CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_cred;
   GO
   ```

1. Create the database encryption key that will be used for TDE.

   ``` sql
   USE ContosoDatabase;
   GO

   CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY 
   WITH ALGORITHM = AES_128 
   ENCRYPTION BY SERVER ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;
   GO

   -- Alter the database to enable transparent data encryption.
   ALTER DATABASE ContosoDatabase
   SET ENCRYPTION ON;
   GO
   ```

### Encrypted backups

1. Create a SQL Server login to be used by the Database Engine for encrypting backups, and add the credential to it.

   ``` sql
   USE master;
   -- Create a SQL Server login associated with the asymmetric key
   -- for the Database engine to use when it is encrypting the backup.
   CREATE LOGIN EKM_Login
   FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;
   GO

   -- Alter the Encrypted Backup Login to add the credential for use by
   -- the Database Engine to access the key vault
   ALTER LOGIN EKM_Login
   ADD CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_cred ;
   GO
   ```

1. Backup the database specifying encryption with the asymmetric key stored in the key vault.

   ``` sql
   USE master;
   BACKUP DATABASE [DATABASE_TO_BACKUP]
   TO DISK = N'[PATH TO BACKUP FILE]'
   WITH FORMAT, INIT, SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD,
   ENCRYPTION(ALGORITHM = AES_256, SERVER ASYMMETRIC KEY = [CONTOSO_KEY]);
   GO
   ```

### Column Level Encryption (CLE)

This script creates a symmetric key protected by the asymmetric key in the key vault, and then uses the symmetric key to encrypt data in the database.

``` sql
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
WITH ALGORITHM=AES_256
ENCRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;

DECLARE @DATA VARBINARY(MAX);

--Open the symmetric key for use in this session
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
DECRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;

--Encrypt syntax
SELECT @DATA = ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY'), CONVERT(VARBINARY,'Plain text data to encrypt'));

-- Decrypt syntax
SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DECRYPTBYKEY(@DATA));

--Close the symmetric key
CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY;
```
