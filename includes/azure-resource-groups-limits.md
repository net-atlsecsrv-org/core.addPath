| Resource | Default limit | Maximum limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resources per [resource group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md#resource-groups), per resource type |800 |Some resource types can exceed the 800 limit. See [Resources not limited to 800 instances per resource group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resources-without-rg-limit.md). |
| Deployments per resource group in the deployment history |800<sup>1</sup> |800 |
| Resources per deployment |800 |800 |
| Management locks per unique scope |20 |20 |
| Number of tags per resource or resource group |15 |15 |
| Tag key length |512 |512 |
| Tag value length |256 |256 |

<sup>1</sup>If you reach the limit of 800 deployments per resource group, delete deployments from the history that are no longer needed. Deleting an entry from the deployment history doesn't affect the deployed resources. You can delete entries from the history with [az group deployment delete](/cli/azure/group/deployment) for Azure CLI, or [Remove-AzResourceGroupDeployment](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroupdeployment) in PowerShell.  For a PowerShell script that automates deleting deployments in a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) scenario, see [remove-deployments.ps1](https://gist.github.com/bmoore-msft/ed33fb940dafb09380174b7fca57651f).

#### Template limits

| Value | Default limit | Maximum limit |

| Parameters |256 |256 |
| Variables |256 |256 |
| Resources (including copy count) |800 |800 |

You can exceed some template limits by using a nested template. For more information, see [Use linked templates when you deploy Azure resources](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-linked-templates.md). To reduce the number of parameters, variables, or outputs, you can combine several values into an object. For more information, see [Objects as parameters](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-objects-as-parameters.md).
