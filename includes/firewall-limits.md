| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Data throughput |30 Gbps<sup>1</sup> |
|Rules|10,000. All rule types combined.|
|Maximum DNAT rules|298 for a single public IP address.<br>Any additional public IP addresses contribute to the available SNAT ports, but reduce the number of the available DNAT rules. For example, two public IP addresses allow for 297 DNAT rules. If a rule's protocol is configured for both TCP and UDP, it counts as two rules.|
|Minimum AzureFirewallSubnet size |/26|
|Port range in network and application rules|1 - 65535|
|Public IP addresses|250 maximum. All public IP addresses can be used in DNAT rules and they all contribute to available SNAT ports.|
|IP addresses in IP Groups|Maximum of 100 IP Groups per firewall.<br>Maximum 5000 individual IP addresses or IP prefixes per each IP Group.
|Route table|By default, AzureFirewallSubnet has a 0.0.0.0/0 route with the NextHopType value set to **Internet**.<br><br>Azure Firewall must have direct Internet connectivity. If your AzureFirewallSubnet learns a default route to your on-premises network via BGP, you must override that with a 0.0.0.0/0 UDR with the **NextHopType** value set as **Internet** to maintain direct Internet connectivity. By default, Azure Firewall doesn't support forced tunneling to an on-premises network.<br><br>However, if your configuration requires forced tunneling to an on-premises network, Microsoft will support it on a case by case basis. Contact Support so that we can review your case. If accepted, we'll allow your subscription and ensure the required firewall Internet connectivity is maintained.|
|FQDNs in network rules|For good performance, do not exceed more than 1000 FQDNs across all network rules per firewall.|

<sup>1</sup>If you need to increase these limits, contact Azure Support.
