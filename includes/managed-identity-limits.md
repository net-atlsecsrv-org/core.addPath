- Each managed identity counts towards the object quota limit in an Azure AD tenant as described in [Azure AD service limits and restrictions](../articles/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).
-	The rate at which managed identities can be created have the following limits:

    1. Per Azure AD Tenant per Azure region: 200 create operations per 20 seconds.
    2. Per Azure Subscription per Azure region : 40 create operations per 20 seconds.

- When you create user-assigned managed identities, only alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, and A-Z) and the hyphen (-) are supported. For the assignment to a virtual machine or virtual machine scale set to work properly, the name is limited to 24 characters.
