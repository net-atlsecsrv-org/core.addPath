## Premium SSD

Azure premium SSDs deliver high-performance and low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) with input/output (IO)-intensive workloads. To take advantage of the speed and performance of premium storage disks, you can migrate existing VM disks to Premium SSDs. Premium SSDs are suitable for mission-critical production applications. Premium SSDs can only be used with VM series that are premium storage-compatible.

To learn more about individual VM types and sizes in Azure for Windows, including which sizes are premium storage-compatible, see [Windows VM sizes](../articles/virtual-machines/windows/sizes.md). To learn more about individual VM types and sizes in Azure for Linux, including which sizes are premium storage-compatible, see [Linux VM sizes](../articles/virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md).

### Disk size
[!INCLUDE [disk-storage-premium-ssd-sizes](disk-storage-premium-ssd-sizes.md)]

When you provision a premium storage disk, unlike standard storage, you are guaranteed the capacity, IOPS, and throughput of that disk. For example, if you create a P50 disk, Azure provisions 4,095-GB storage capacity, 7,500 IOPS, and 250-MB/s throughput for that disk. Your application can use all or part of the capacity and performance. Premium SSD disks are designed to provide low single-digit millisecond latencies and target IOPS and throughput described in the preceding table 99.9% of the time.

### Transactions

For premium SSDs, each I/O operation less than or equal to 256 KiB of throughput is considered a single I/O operation. I/O operations larger than 256 KiB of throughput are considered multiple I/Os of size 256 KiB.

## Standard SSD

Azure standard SSDs are a cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels. Standard SSD offers a good entry level experience for those who wish to move to the cloud, especially if you experience issues with the variance of workloads running on your HDD solutions on premises. Compared to standard HDDs, standard SSDs deliver better availability, consistency, reliability, and latency. Standard SSDs are suitable for Web servers, low IOPS application servers, lightly used enterprise applications, and Dev/Test workloads. Like standard HDDs, standard SSDs are available on all Azure VMs.

### Disk size
[!INCLUDE [disk-storage-standard-ssd-sizes](disk-storage-standard-ssd-sizes.md)]

Standard SSDs are designed to provide single-digit millisecond latencies and the IOPS and throughput up to the limits described in the preceding table 99% of the time. Actual IOPS and throughput may vary sometimes depending on the traffic patterns. Standard SSDs will provide more consistent performance than the HDD disks with the lower latency.

### Transactions

For standard SSDs, each I/O operation less than or equal to 256 KiB of throughput is considered a single I/O operation. I/O operations larger than 256 KiB of throughput are considered multiple I/Os of size 256 KiB. These transactions have a billing impact.

## Standard HDD

Azure standard HDDs deliver reliable, low-cost disk support for VMs running latency-insensitive workloads. With standard storage, the data is stored on hard disk drives (HDDs). Latency, IOPS and Throughput of Standard HDD disks may vary more widely as compared to SSD-based disks. Average latencies for Standard HDD disks may vary between single-digit and double-digit milliseconds depending on the workload pattern. When working with VMs, you can use standard HDD disks for dev/test scenarios and less critical workloads. Standard HDDs are available in all Azure regions and can be used with all Azure VMs.

### Disk size
[!INCLUDE [disk-storage-standard-hdd-sizes](disk-storage-standard-hdd-sizes.md)]

### Transactions

For Standard HDDs, each IO operation is considered as a single transaction, regardless of the I/O size. These transactions have a billing impact.

## Billing

When using managed disks, the following billing considerations apply:

- Disk type
- managed disk Size
- Snapshots
- Outbound data transfers
- Number of transactions

**Managed disk size**: managed disks are billed on the provisioned size. Azure maps the provisioned size (rounded up) to the nearest offered disk size. For details of the disk sizes offered, see the previous tables. Each disk maps to a supported provisioned disk size offering and is billed accordingly. For example, if you provisioned a 200 GiB Standard SSD, it maps to the disk size offer of E15 (256 GiB). Billing for any provisioned disk is prorated hourly by using the monthly price for the Premium Storage offer. For example, if you provisioned an E10 disk and deleted it after 20 hours, you're billed for the E10 offering prorated to 20 hours. This is regardless of the amount of actual data written to the disk.

**Snapshots**: Snapshots are billed based on the size used. For example, if you create a snapshot of a managed disk with provisioned capacity of 64 GiB and actual used data size of 10 GiB, the snapshot is billed only for the used data size of 10 GiB.
