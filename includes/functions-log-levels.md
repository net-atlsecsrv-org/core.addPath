A *log level* is assigned to every log. The value is an integer that indicates relative importance:

|LogLevel    |Code| Description |
|------------|---|--------------|
|Trace       | 0 |Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment.|
|Debug       | 1 | Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term value. |
|Information | 2 | Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value. |
|Warning     | 3 | Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but don't otherwise cause the application execution to stop. |
|Error       | 4 | Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped because of a failure. These errors should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. |
|Critical    | 5 | Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. |
|None        | 6 | Disables logging for the specified category. |

The [*host.json* file](../articles/azure-functions/functions-host-json.md) configuration determines how much logging a functions app sends to Application Insights.
