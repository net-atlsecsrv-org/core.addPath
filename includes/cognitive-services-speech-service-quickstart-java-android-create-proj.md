Android Studio takes a moment to prepare your new Android project. Next, configure the project to know about the Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK and to use Java 8.

[!INCLUDE [License notice](cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

The current version of the Cognitive Services Speech SDK is 1.12.0.

The Speech SDK for Android is packaged as an [AAR (Android Library)](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), which includes the necessary libraries and required Android permissions.
It's hosted in a Maven repository at https:\//csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/.

Set up your project to use the Speech SDK. Open the **Project Structure** window by selecting **File** > **Project Structure** from the Android Studio menu bar. In the **Project Structure** window, make the following changes:

1. In the list on the left side of the window, select **Project**. Edit the **Default Library Repository** settings by appending a comma and our Maven repository URL enclosed in single quotation marks: 'https:\//csspeechstorage.blob.core.windows.net/maven/'
