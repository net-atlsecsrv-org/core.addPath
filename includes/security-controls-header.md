A security control is a quality or feature of an Azure service that contributes to the service's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to security vulnerabilities.

For each control, we use "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether it is currently in place for the service, "N/A" for a control that is not applicable to the service. We might also provide a note or links to more information about an attribute.
