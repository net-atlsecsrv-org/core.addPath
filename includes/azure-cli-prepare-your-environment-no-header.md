   [![Embed launch](https://shell.azure.com/images/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Azure Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com)   
- If you prefer, [install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI to run CLI reference commands.
   - If you're using a local install, sign in with Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.  To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal.  See [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) for additional sign-in options.
  - When you're prompted, install Azure CLI extensions on first use.  For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
  - Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az_version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az_upgrade).
