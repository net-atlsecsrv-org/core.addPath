A day is based on UTC. Note that data collected by Azure Security Center is not included in this 500 MB per day limit and will continue to be collected above this limit.  |
| Legacy Standalone Per GB tier<br>(introduced April 2016) | No limit | 30 to 730 days | Data retention beyond 31 days is available for additional charges. Learn more about Azure Monitor pricing. |

**Data ingestion volume rate**


Azure Monitor is a high scale data service that serves thousands of customers sending terabytes of data each month at a growing pace. The default ingestion volume rate limit for data sent from Azure resources using [diagnostic settings](../articles/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) is approximately **6 GB/min** per workspace. This is an approximate value since the actual size can vary between data types depending on the log length and its compression ratio. This limit does not apply to data that is sent from agents or [Data Collector API](../articles/azure-monitor/platform/data-collector-api.md).

If you send data at a higher rate to a single workspace, some data is dropped, and an event is sent to the *Operation* table in your workspace every 6 hours while the threshold continues to be exceeded. If your ingestion volume continues to exceed the rate limit or you are expecting to reach it sometime soon, you can request an increase to your workspace by opening a support request.
 
To be notified on such an event in your workspace, create a [log alert rule](../articles/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-log.md) using the following query with alert logic base on number of results grater than zero.

``` Kusto
Operation
|where OperationCategory == "Ingestion"
|where Detail startswith "The rate of data crossed the threshold"
```
