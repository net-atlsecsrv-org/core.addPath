In Azure DevTest Labs, custom images enable you to create VMs quickly without waiting for all the required software to be installed on the target machine. Custom images allow you to pre-install all the software that you need in a VHD file, and then use the VHD file to create a VM. Because the software is already installed, the VM creation time is much quicker. In addition, custom images can be used to clone VMs by creating a custom image from a VM, and then creating VMs based on that custom image.
