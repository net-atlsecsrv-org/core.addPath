The form requests information about you, your company, and the user scenario for which you'll use the container. After you submit the form, the Azure Cognitive Services team will review it and email you with a decision.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * On the form, you must use an email address associated with an Azure subscription ID.
> * The Azure resource you use to run the container must have been created with the approved Azure subscription ID. 
> * Check your email (both inbox and junk folders) for updates on the status of your application from Microsoft.

After you're approved, you will be able to run the container after downloading it from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), described later in the article. 

You won't be able to run the container if your Azure subscription has not been approved.
