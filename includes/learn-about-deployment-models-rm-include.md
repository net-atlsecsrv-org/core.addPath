> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two different deployment models you can use to create and work with resources: [Azure Resource Manager and classic](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers the use of the Resource Manager deployment model. We recommend the Resource Manager deployment model for new deployments instead of the classic deployment model.
