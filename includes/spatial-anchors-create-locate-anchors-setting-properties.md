## Set properties

You may choose to add some properties when saving your cloud spatial anchors. Like the type of object being saved, or basic properties like whether it should be enabled for interaction. Doing so can be useful upon discovery: you can immediately render the object for the user, for example a picture frame with blank content. Then, a different download in the background gets additional state details, for example, the picture to display in the frame.
