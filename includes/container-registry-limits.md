<sup>1</sup>The specified storage limits are the amount of *included* storage for each tier. You're charged an additional daily rate per GiB for image storage above these limits. For rate information, see [Azure Container Registry pricing][pricing].

<sup>2</sup>*ReadOps*, *WriteOps*, and *Bandwidth* are minimum estimates. Azure Container Registry strives to improve performance as usage requires.

<sup>3</sup>A [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pulling-an-image) translates to multiple read operations based on the number of layers in the image, plus the manifest retrieval.

<sup>4</sup>A [docker push](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pushing-an-image) translates to multiple write operations, based on the number of layers that must be pushed. A `docker push` includes *ReadOps* to retrieve a manifest for an existing image.
