In the **Manage** section (top right menu), on the **Keys and endpoints** page (left menu), select the **endpoint** URL at the bottom of the page. This action opens another browser tab with the endpoint URL in the address bar. 

The endpoint URL looks like `https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/<appID>?verbose=true&subscription-key=<YOUR_KEY>&<optional-name-value-pairs>&q=<user-utterance-text>`.
