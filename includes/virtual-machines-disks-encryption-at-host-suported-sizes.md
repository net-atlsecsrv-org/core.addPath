All the latest generation of VM sizes support encryption at host:

|Type  |Not Supported  |Supported  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|General purpose     | Dv3, Dav4, Dv2, Av2        | B, DSv2, Dsv3, DC, DCv2, Dasv4        |
|Compute optimized     |         | Fsv2        |
|Memory optimized     | Ev3, Eav4        | DSv2, Esv3, M, Mv2, Easv4        |
|Storage optimized     |         | Ls, Lsv2 (NVMe disks not encrypted)        |
|GPU     | NC, NV        | NCv2, NCv3, ND, NVv3, NVv4, NDv2 (preview)        |
|High performance compute     | H        | HB, HC, HBv2        |
|Previous generations     | F, A, D, L, G        | DS, GS, Fs, NVv2        |

Upgrading the VM size will result in validation to check if the new VM size supports the EncryptionAtHost feature.
