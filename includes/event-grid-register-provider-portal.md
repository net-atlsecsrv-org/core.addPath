## Enable Event Grid resource provider

If you haven't previously used Event Grid in your Azure subscription, you may need to register the Event Grid resource provider.

In the Azure portal:

1. Select **Subscriptions**.
1. Select the subscription you're using for Event Grid.
1. Under **Settings**, select **Resource providers**.
1. Find **Microsoft.EventGrid**.
1. If not registered, select **Register**. 

It may take a moment for the registration to finish. Select **Refresh** to update the status. When **Status** is **Registered**, you're ready to continue.
