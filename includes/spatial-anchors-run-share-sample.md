## [Android](#tab/Android)

The Java Android sample supports sharing across devices.

In Android Studio, open the *SharedActivity.java* file from the samples folder. 

Enter the URL that you copied in the previous step (from your ASP.NET web app Azure deployment) as the value for `SharingAnchorsServiceUrl` in the *SharedActivity.java* file. 

Replace the `index.html` in the URL with `api/anchors`. It should look like this: `https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/anchors`.

Open the *SharedDemoViewController.m* file in the samples folder. 

Enter the URL you obtained in the previous step (from your ASP.NET web app Azure deployment) as the value for `SharingAnchorsServiceUrl` in the *SharedDemoViewController.m* file.

Deploy the app to your device.
