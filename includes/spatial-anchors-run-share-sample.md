## Set up your device in Unity

[!INCLUDE [Open Unity Project](spatial-anchors-open-unity-project.md)]

### Set up an Android Device

[!INCLUDE [Android Unity Build Settings](spatial-anchors-unity-android-build-settings.md)]

### Set up an iOS Device

[!INCLUDE [iOS Unity Build Settings](spatial-anchors-unity-ios-build-settings.md)]

## Configure the account identifier and key

In the **Project** pane, navigate to `Assets/AzureSpatialAnchorsPlugin/Examples` and open the `AzureSpatialAnchorsLocalSharedDemo.unity` scene file.

[!INCLUDE [Configure Unity Scene](spatial-anchors-unity-configure-scene.md)]

In the **Project** pane, navigate to `Assets\AzureSpatialAnchors.Examples\Resources`. Select `SpatialAnchorSamplesConfig`. Then, in the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Sharing Anchors Service url` (from your ASP.NET web app Azure deployment) as the value for `Base Sharing Url`, replacing `index.html` with `api/anchors`. It should look like this: `https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/anchors`.

Save the scene by selecting **File** > **Save**.

## Deploy to your device

### Deploy to Android device

Sign in on your Android device and connect it to your computer by using a USB cable.

Open **Build Settings** by selecting **File** > **Build Settings**.

Under **Scenes In Build**, ensure all the scenes have a check mark next to them.

Make sure **Export Project** doesn't have a check mark. Select **Build And Run**. You'll be prompted to save your `.apk` file. You can pick any name for it.

Once the app starts, in the **Choose A Demo** dialog, use the left or right arrows to select the **LocalShare** option, and tap **Go!**. Follow the instructions in the app. You can select **Create & Share Anchor** or **Locate Shared Anchor**.

The first scenario lets you create an anchor that can be located later on the same device or on a different one.
The second scenario, if you've already run the app, either on the same device or on a different one, allows you
to locate previously shared anchors. After you pick your scenario, the app will guide you with further
instructions around what to do. For example, you'll be asked to move your device around to collect environment
information. Later on, you'll place an anchor in the world, wait for it to save, and so on.

### Deploy to an iOS device

Open **Build Settings** by selecting **File** > **Build Settings**.

Under **Scenes In Build**, ensure all the scenes have a check mark next to them.

[!INCLUDE [Configure Xcode](spatial-anchors-unity-ios-xcode.md)]

Once the app starts, in the **Choose A Demo** dialog, use the left or right arrows to select the **LocalShare** option, and tap **Go!**. Follow the instructions in the app. You can select **Create & Share Anchor** or **Locate Shared Anchor**.

The first scenario lets you create an anchor that can be located later on the same device or on a different one.
The second scenario, if you've already run the app, either on the same device or on a different one, allows you

instructions around what to do. For example, you'll be asked to move your device around to collect environment
information. Later on, you'll place an anchor in the world, wait for it to save, and so on.

In Xcode, stop the app by selecting **Stop**.
