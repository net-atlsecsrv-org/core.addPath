## [Android](#tab/Android)

The Java android sample supports sharing across devices.
Open the file `SharedActivity.java` from the samples folder in Android Studio. Enter the url you obtained in the previous step (from your ASP.NET web app Azure deployment) as the value for `SharingAnchorsServiceUrl` in the `SharedActivity.java` file. Replace the `index.html` in the url with `api/anchors`. It should look like this: `https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/anchors`.
