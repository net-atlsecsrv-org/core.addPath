This quickstart uses the authoring key for convenience. The key is primarily for authoring the model but does allow a small number (1000) of endpoint requests. When you are ready for more endpoint requests in a test, stage or production environment, create a **Language Understanding** resource in the Azure portal and assign it to the LUIS app in the LUIS portal.
