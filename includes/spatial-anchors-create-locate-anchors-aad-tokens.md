### Azure Active Directory Authentication

Azure Spatial Anchors also allows applications to authenticate with user Azure AD (Active Directory) tokens. For example, you can use Azure AD tokens to integrate with Azure Spatial Anchors. If an Enterprise maintains users in Azure AD, you can supply a user Azure AD token in the Azure Spatial Anchors SDK. Doing so allows you to authenticate directly to the Azure Spatial Anchors service for an account that's part of the same Azure AD tenant.
