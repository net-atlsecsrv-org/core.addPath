<sup>1</sup>Default limits vary by offer category type, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350.

<sup>2</sup>You can apply an unlimited number of tags per subscription. The number of tags per resource or resource group is limited to 15. Resource Manager returns a [list of unique tag name and values](/rest/api/resources/tags) in the subscription only when the number of tags is 10,000 or less. You still can find a resource by tag when the number exceeds 10,000.  

<sup>3</sup>These features are no longer required with Azure resource groups and Resource Manager.

<sup>4</sup>If you reach the limit of 800 deployments, delete deployments from the history that are no longer needed. To delete subscription level deployments, use [Remove-AzDeployment](/powershell/module/az.resources/Remove-AzDeployment) or [az deployment delete](/cli/azure/deployment?view=azure-cli-latest#az-deployment-delete).

> [!NOTE]
> Virtual machine cores have a regional total limit. They also have a limit for regional per-size series, such as Dv2 and F. These limits are separately enforced. For example, consider a subscription with a US East total VM core limit of 30, an A series core limit of 30, and a D series core limit of 30. This subscription can deploy 30 A1 VMs, or 30 D1 VMs, or a combination of the two not to exceed a total of 30 cores. An example of a combination is 10 A1 VMs and 20 D1 VMs.
