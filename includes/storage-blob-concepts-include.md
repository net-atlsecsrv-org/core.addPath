Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

## About Blob storage

Blob storage is designed for:

* Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
* Storing files for distributed access.
* Streaming video and audio.
* Writing to log files.
* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Users or client applications can access objects in Blob storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. Objects in Blob storage are accessible via the [Azure Storage REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage), or an Azure Storage client library. Client libraries are available for different languages, including:

* [.NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage?view=azure-dotnet)
* [Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/storage)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/storage)
* [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python)
* [Go](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-blob-go/)
* [PHP](https://azure.github.io/azure-storage-php/)
* [Ruby](https://azure.github.io/azure-storage-ruby)
