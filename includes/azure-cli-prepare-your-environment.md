## Prepare your environment

- To run Azure CLI commands, do a [local install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) of the Azure CLI, or start [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) using the bash environment.

- If you're using a local install, sign in with Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.  Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.  See [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) for additional sign in options.
- When prompted, install Azure CLI extensions on first use.  Learn more about extensions in [Use extensions with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
