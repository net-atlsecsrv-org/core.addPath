At the top of the Program class, add the following constants to access QnA Maker:

```csharp
// Represents the various elements used to create HTTP request URIs
// for QnA Maker operations.
static string host = "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com";
static string service = "/qnamaker/v4.0";
static string method = "/knowledgebases/create";

// NOTE: Replace this value with a valid QnA Maker subscription key.
static string key = "<your-qna-maker-subscription-key>";
```

The first three constants are used to create the full URL for the API. The last constant provides authentication to the API.
