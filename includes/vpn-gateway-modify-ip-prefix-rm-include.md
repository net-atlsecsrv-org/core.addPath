To add additional address prefixes:

1. Set the variable for the LocalNetworkGateway.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $local = Get-AzLocalNetworkGateway -Name Site1 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
   ```
1. Modify the prefixes.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Set-AzLocalNetworkGateway -LocalNetworkGateway $local `
   -AddressPrefix @('10.101.0.0/24','10.101.1.0/24','10.101.2.0/24')
   ```

To remove address prefixes:

  Leave out the prefixes that you no longer need. In this example, we no longer need prefix 10.101.2.0/24 (from the previous example), so we update the local network gateway, excluding that prefix.

1. Set the variable for the LocalNetworkGateway.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $local = Get-AzLocalNetworkGateway -Name Site1 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
   ```
1. Set the gateway with the updated prefixes.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Set-AzLocalNetworkGateway -LocalNetworkGateway $local `
   -AddressPrefix @('10.101.0.0/24','10.101.1.0/24')
   ```
