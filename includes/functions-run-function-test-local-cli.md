## Run the function locally

Run your function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host from the *LocalFunctionProj* folder:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp,programming-language-powershell,programming-language-javascript,programming-language-python"
```
func host start
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"
```
npm install
npm start
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
```
mvn clean package 
mvn azure-functions:run
```
::: zone-end

Toward the end of the output, the following lines should appear: 

<pre>
...

Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7071
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.

Http Functions:

        HttpExample: [GET,POST] http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample
...

</pre>

>[!NOTE]  
> If HttpExample doesn't appear as shown below, you likely started the host from outside the root folder of the project. In that case, use **Ctrl**+**C** to stop the host, navigate to the project's root folder, and run the previous command again.

Copy the URL of your `HttpExample` function from this output to a browser and append the query string `?name=<your-name>`, making the full URL like `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`. The browser should display a message like `Hello Functions`:

![Result of the function run locally in the browser](./media/functions-run-function-test-local-cli/function-test-local-browser.png)

The terminal in which you started your project also shows log output as you make requests.

When you're ready, use **Ctrl**+**C** and choose `y` to stop the functions host.
