If you plan to continue to the next tutorial, keep the resources you created in this quickstart for that you can reuse them.

If you're finished with the quickstart sample application, delete the Azure resources you created in this quickstart to avoid charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you don't accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the resources for hosting this sample inside a resource group that contains resources you want to keep, delete each resource individually from its respective pane instead of deleting the resource group.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and select **Resource groups**.
1. In the **Filter by name** box, enter the name of your resource group. 
1. In the result list, select the resource group, and either right-click the row or use the **ellipsis** (**...**) button to open the context menu.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. You're asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Enter the name of your resource group to confirm, and select **Delete**.

After a few moments, the resource group and all its resources are deleted.
