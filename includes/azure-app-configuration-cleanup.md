If you do not want to continue using the resources created in this article, delete the resource group you created here to avoid charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you don't accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the resources for this article inside a resource group that contains other resources you want to keep, delete each resource individually from its respective pane instead of deleting the resource group.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and select **Resource groups**.
1. In the **Filter by name** box, enter the name of your resource group. 
1. In the result list, select the resource group name to see an overview.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. You're asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Enter the name of your resource group to confirm, and select **Delete**.

After a few moments, the resource group and all its resources are deleted.
