> [!TIP]
> The content in this article applies to the original Azure Table storage. However, there is now an alternative offering for table storage: the Azure Cosmos DB Table API. This API offers higher performance and availability, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. It is also available in a consumption-based [serverless](../articles/cosmos-db/serverless.md) mode. There are some [feature differences](../articles/cosmos-db/table-api-faq.md#table-api-vs-table-storage) between Table API in Azure Cosmos DB and Azure table storage. For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB Table API](../articles/cosmos-db/table-introduction.md).
