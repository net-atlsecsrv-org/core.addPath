> [!TIP]
> The content in this article applies to the original Azure Table storage. However, there is now a premium offering for table storage: the Azure Cosmos DB Table API. This API offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. There are some [feature differences between Table API in Azure Cosmos DB and Azure table storage](../articles/cosmos-db/table-api-faq.md#table-api-vs-table-storage). For more information, and to try out the premium experience, see [Azure Cosmos DB Table API](https://aka.ms/premiumtables).
