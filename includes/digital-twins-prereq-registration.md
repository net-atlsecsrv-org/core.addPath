To authenticate all the resources used in this article, you'll need to set up an [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../articles/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) **app registration**. Follow the instructions in [*How-to: Create an app registration*](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-create-app-registration.md) to set this up. 

Once you have an app registration, you'll need the registration's **_Application (client) ID_** and **_Directory (tenant) ID_** ([find in the Azure portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-create-app-registration.md#collect-client-id-and-tenant-id)). Take note of these values to use them later to grant access to the Azure Digital Twins APIs.
