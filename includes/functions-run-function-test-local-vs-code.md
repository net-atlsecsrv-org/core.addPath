## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](../articles/azure-functions/functions-run-local.md) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

1. To call your function, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the function app project. Output from Core Tools is displayed in the **Terminal** panel. Your app starts in the **Terminal** panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.

    If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to **WSL Bash**.

1. With Core Tools running, go to the **Azure: Functions** area. Under **Functions**, expand **Local Project** > **Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> click (macOS) the `HttpExample` function and choose **Execute Function Now...**.

1. In **Enter request body** you see the request message body value of `{ "name": "Azure" }`. Press Enter to send this request message to your function. 

   You could have instead sent an HTTP GET request to the `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample` address in a web browser.

1. When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in **Terminal** panel.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.
