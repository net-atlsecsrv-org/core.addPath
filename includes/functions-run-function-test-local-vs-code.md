## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](../articles/azure-functions/functions-run-local.md) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

1. To call your function, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the function app project. Output from Core Tools is displayed in the **Terminal** panel. If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to **WSL Bash**.

1. If you haven't already installed Azure Functions Core Tools, select **Install** at the prompt. When the Core Tools are installed, your app starts in the **Terminal** panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.

1. With Core Tools running, navigate to the following URL to execute a GET request, which includes `?name=Functions` query string.

    `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

1. A response is returned, which looks like the following in a browser:

1. Information about the request is shown in **Terminal** panel.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.
