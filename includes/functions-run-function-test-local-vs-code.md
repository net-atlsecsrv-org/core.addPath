## Run the function locally

Azure Functions Core Tools lets you run an Azure Functions project on your local development computer.

1. To test your function, set a breakpoint in the function code and press F5 to start the function app project. Output from Core Tools is displayed in the **Terminal** panel.

1. In the **Terminal** panel, copy the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function.
