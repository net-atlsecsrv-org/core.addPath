If you don't already have a certificate, you can use a self-signed certificate. A self-signed certificate is a security certificate that is not signed by a certificate authority (CA) and doesn't provide the security guarantees of a certificate signed by a CA. 

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

On Windows, use PowerShell's [New-SelfSignedCertificate](/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate) cmdlet to generate a certificate.

1. Execute this PowerShell command to generate a self-signed certificate. Modify the `-Subject` argument as appropriate for your application and Azure AD B2C tenant name. You can also adjust the `-NotAfter` date to specify a different expiration for the certificate.

    ```PowerShell
    New-SelfSignedCertificate `
        -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
        -Subject "CN=yourappname.yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com" `
        -KeyAlgorithm RSA `
        -KeyLength 2048 `
        -KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
        -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddMonths(12) `
        -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"
    ```

1. Open **Manage user certificates** > **Current User** > **Personal** > **Certificates** > *yourappname.yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com*.
1. Select the certificate, and then select **Action** > **All Tasks** > **Export**.
1. Select **Yes** > **Next** > **Yes, export the private key** > **Next**.
1. Accept the defaults for **Export File Format**.
1. Provide a password for the certificate.

For Azure AD B2C to accept the .pfx file password, the password must be encrypted with the TripleDES-SHA1 option in Windows Certificate Store Export utility as opposed to AES256-SHA256.

# [macOS](#tab/macos)

On macOS, use [Certificate Assistant](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/aside/glosa3ed0609/11.0/mac/11.0) in Keychain Access to generate a certificate.

1. Follow the instructions for how to [create self-signed certificates in Keychain Access on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/kyca8916/mac).
1. In the Keychain Access app on your Mac, select the certificate you created.
1. Choose **File** > **Export Items**.
1. Select a file name to save your certificate. For example, **self-signed-certificate.p12**.
1. For the **File Format**, select **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Enter a **Password**, and then **Verify** the password.
1. Replace the file extension to `.pfx`. For example, **self-signed-certificate.pfx**.
