## Trusted Microsoft services
When you enable the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall** setting, the following services are granted access to your Event Hubs resources.

| Trusted service | Supported usage scenarios | 
| --------------- | ------------------------- | 
| Azure Event Grid | Allows Azure Event Grid to send events to event hubs in your Event Hubs namespace. You also need to do the following steps: <ul><li>Enable system-assigned identity for a topic or a domain</li><li>Add the identity to the Azure Event Hubs Data Sender role on the Event Hubs namespace</li><li>Then, configure the event subscription that uses an event hub as an endpoint to use the system-assigned identity.</li></ul> <p>For more information, see [Event delivery with a managed identity](../articles/event-grid/managed-service-identity.md)</p>|
| Azure Monitor (Diagnostic Settings) | Allows Azure Monitor to send diagnostic information to event hubs in your Event Hubs namespace. Azure Monitor can read from the event hub and also write data to the event hub. |
| Azure Stream Analytics | Allows an Azure Stream Analytics job to read data from ([input](../articles/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-add-inputs.md)) or write data to ([output](../articles/stream-analytics/event-hubs-output.md)) event hubs in your Event Hubs namespace. <p>**Important**: The Stream Analytics job should be configured to use a **managed identity** to access the event hub. For more information, see [Use managed identities to access Event Hub from an Azure Stream Analytics job (Preview)](../articles/stream-analytics/event-hubs-managed-identity.md). </p>|
| Azure IoT Hub | Allows IoT Hub to send messages to event hubs in your Event Hub namespace. You also need to do the following steps: <ul><li>Enable system-assigned identity for your IoT hub</li><li>Add the identity to the Azure Event Hubs Data Sender role on the Event Hubs namespace.</li><li>Then, configure the IoT Hub that uses an event hub as a custom endpoint to use the identity-based authentication.</li></ul>
| Azure API Management | <p>The API Management service allows you to send events to an event hub in your Event Hubs namespace.</p> <ul><li>You can trigger custom workflows by sending events to your event hub when an API is invoked by using the [send-request policy](../articles/api-management/api-management-sample-send-request.md).</li><li>You can also treat an event hub as your backend in an API. For a sample policy, see [Authenticate using a managed identity to access an event hub](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets/blob/master/examples/Authenticate%20using%20Managed%20Identity%20to%20access%20Event%20Hub.xml). You also need to do the following steps:<ol><li>Enable system-assigned identity on the API Management instance. For instructions, see [Use managed identities in Azure API Management](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity.md).</li><li>Add the identity to the **Azure Event Hubs Data Sender** role on the Event Hubs namespace</li></ol></li></ul> |
